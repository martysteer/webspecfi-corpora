The year before, he had had installed a `real fire.' As he had said at the time, \"It gives the place a homely look-- with a log fire blazing merrily away in the living room, you can really _believe_ that an your home is an impregnable fortress, gallantly keeping the elements at bay whether you be sleeping or awake.\" Colin smiled to himself, as he often did at these moments, and gave thanks that his wife had taken Jason, the two year-old, to her parents for the weekend. A long, pleasant and-- above all-- _quiet_ weekend stretched out before him as he lowered his body into the comfy armchair by the fire. Colin shifted slightly, to get as comfortable as possible, then adjusted the table lamp to _just_ the right angle before picking up the book and beginning to read...\nJust as the hero was about to decapitate the gargantuan nine-headed beast, Colin's attention was diverted by the sound of someone moving around in the next room. \"Strange, there's nobody home. Maybe Karen had to come back early,\" Colin said to himself. \"God, I hope not-- I think I'd prefer burglars!\" The middle-aged civil servant hoisted his bulk from the chair and wandered into the other room to investigate, pausing only to procure a poker from beside the fire. \"Just in case...\"\n\"Odd,\" thought Colin as he approached the door. the sounds from within had started to collect into words. Speech. In a very strange accent, but-- nonetheless-- English. He slowly opened the door and, poker brandished at the ready, strode into the room. \"Who are you, and what are you doing in my home?\" Hardly an original line, but then nobody awards points for creativity at these moments.\nColin stopped. There were four people in the kitchen. Three of them were arguing over the toaster, while the fourth-- a tall, and rather attractive, blonde woman-- looked on. Deliberately and carefully, the blonde turned to face Colin.\n\"We come in peace.\" she stated, simply. It looked like cliches were to be the order of the day. Was this some kind of joke? She didn't look to Colin like she was joking but, nonetheless, her words-- and that weird accent!\nColin hesitated a moment, then: \"Do you, now? Do you usually `come in peace' by breaking into someone's house, and ransacking their possessions?\"\n\"I must apologize for my friends. They are being,perhaps, a little... overzealous...\" The three, dressed-- as was the blonde woman-- in brown, discoloured rags and bereft of shoes, now seemed to be in the those of a disagreement over whose turn it was to drink from the cold water tap. The blonde followed Colin's gaze, looked at her friends then returned her stare to the house's owner. She shrugged.\n\"Perhaps I should explain myself,\" she continued.\n\"Yes, I think maybe you ought to!\" snapped Colin, who now looked on, bemused as the strange blonde's three companions had a fight over the contents of the icebox.\nUnperturbed, the blonde introduced herself as, \"Just call me `Alice'.\" and went on to describe how she and her three companions were refugees from Colin's own future.\n\"Oh. Of course,\" burst in Colin, \"I had somebody from the twenty-fifth century for tea last week. Why didn't you say so? Perhaps you would like a quick cup of coffee, before going back to battle daleks or take a spin around Saturn's moons?\" His voice cracked, as he shrieked, \"Do you think I was born yesterday? You come in here, argue about who gets what in my home then expect me to believe any cock and bull story you care to spin about being time travelers? Well, you're not time travellers!\"\n\"How can you be so sure?\" broke in the blonde, Alice, smoothly.\nSurprised by the simple audacity of the question, Colin was momentarily nonplussed, before spluttering: \"Well, for one thing, time travellers would be better dressed!\"\n\"Look, just hear me out, then-- if you still don't believe me-- we'll leave you. Okay?\"\n\"No, it's _not_ bloody okay! Get out now, or I'll call the police!\"\n\"We're not going. _I_ am not going. Not until you've at least heard us out.\" Colin sighed. He'd had a wonderfully peaceful weekend planned, and it seemed to be falling apart about his ears. But he resigned himself to hearing Alice's story, and led her-- followed by her retinue-- into the living room, where he settled down in his comfy chair and awaited the tale. At least there would be some entertainment - if only he could find the popcorn...\n\"Picture it: North America, ravaged by war and plagued-- yes, _literally_ plagued-- by disease. The Statue of Liberty toppled like a house of cards, the remains used by destitutes as stepping stones across the Hudson. The Capitol's roof destroyed, caved in by the backwash from an atomic blast. The Golden Gate Bridge no longer capable of supporting the weight even of an anorexic ant. The United States now disunited, and battling amongst themselves for what remains of the spoils of war, while Mexico and Canada, themselves war-torn lands, sit on the sidelines, occassionally swooping, vulture-like, on the carcasses of shattered principalities. Picture it, if you can. That is the world I-- we-- left behind. And, unless we can do something-- unless we can convince _you_ to help us-- then the war which began the nightmare will come to pass. And The United States will be destroyed, along with the rest of the world.\"\nColin, mouth gaping, stared a moment at Alice. Then, taking ahold of himself, shook his head as if to clear Alice's description from his mind. \"You're serious.\" It was a statement, not a question, but Alice nodded nonetheless. Colin picked up the phone and dialled, carefully: 9... 1... 1.\n\"Hello, emergency services? I'd like a-- what the Hell... ? What? Oh, never mind...\" He put the phone down, replacing the receiver in its cradle with all the care of a raw-egg juggler. Emulating the studied patience and concentration of a Zen master, Colin watched the receiver settle in its bed before looking up to check what had so startled him a moment before. It was still there. Or, rather, _they_ were still there. The original group of four had multiplied to eight _while Colin was watching_. Nobody had entered the room-- not by conventional means, anyway. Yet four people had... appeared. Colin was, to say the least, mildly surprised.\nThe four newcomers were dressed far more smartly than the first arrivals. Perhaps they came from a different time period. Colin caught the thought. Time travellers? Well, let's face it-- either the second group teleported in, which is impossible, or they arrived via a time machine, which is impossible. The difference lay in the fact that they _claimed_ the latter. And so the pendulum of decision hung in that direction, for the moment.\nColin looked the latest group over. The clothes were definately plusher than Alice's band-- they wore loose-fitting robes, after the fashion of Ancient Roman togas-- each robe being a single solid block of a bright colour: red, blue, green and... a tall, statuesque brunette wore a white `toga.'\nThat brunette turned to look at Colin, as he gasped in astonishment. Alice! The two Alices noticed each other then-- and paused to look one another over. Ragged Alice was the first to speak: \"You dyed your hair. It doesn't suit you.\"\n\"Who _are_ you? No-- don't answer that,\" began the be-toga'ed Alice, \"I know who you are-- you're me. But how? And why do you have such goddawful clothing? Are you me from my future? If so, why are you here?\"\n\"I was about to ask you the same thing. Since I have no memory of having been you-- and you seem to have none of having been me-- perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me why you are here?\"\n\"You know as well as I why I'm here-- your presence indicates that your research has led you to the same conclusion to which mine led me. This is a junction point. To be more precise, this _man_ is a junction point. His actions can start, or prevent, a world war.\"\nColin burst in, \"What are you two talking about? I'm no world leader - how can I start off Armageddon? I'm just a government clerk. I'm good at my job, sure. But that's as far as it goes.\"\nThe trampesque Alice broke into Colin's monotribe: \"Tomorrow, a memo will cross your desk marked `SFF-524G\/Q.' If you fail to pass it on, the Pentagon will be unaware of a small, but significant, item of information. This ignorance will lead to a breakdown in communications and then, gradually, to a small conflict between states within what you know as the United States of America. As further states join the dispute, so the conflict will escalate until those states which currently maintain a nuclear arsenal-- in the name of the National Defense-- use them on those regions which they view as enemies. The automated defence computers will register a first strike on US soil, and launch a counter-attack-- against the Eastern Bloc. The resulting conflict destroys most Life on Earth.\"\n\"My God,\" Colin breathed, \"For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost... Well, I must ensure that I don't lose that memo! Will that make things alright? Will that stop the war?\"\n\"We think so,\" began The war-torn Alice, \"But, just to be sure...\"\n\"Wait,\" blurted the more refined Alice, \"Think this through. Sure, there will be no war. But-- well, perhaps I'd better tell you why _I_ am here...\n\"In _my_ history, which seems to be different from yours,\" she gestured in the other Alice's direction, \"the memo got through. There was no war, and consequently no massive investment in research-- How long from now is your war due to begin, if the memo fails to get through?\" The question was directed at the other Alice.\n\"Twenty-four years before the opening of hostilities, One hundred and sixteen years before the first atomic weapon is used. Why?\"\n\"Just a thought. Don't you realize that mankind _needs_ this war? If there is no war, then there is no impetous to survive-- to _live_. War means money poured into research-- defense systems, weapons systems, computers, space. No war, no research. No research, no advancement. In short, stagnation. The human race will reach its demise gradually, through apathy. Nobody caring enough to _do_ anything anymore. The world ending, to borrow one of your phrases,\" she nods at Colin, \"Not with a bang, but a whimper.\"\nColin, half out of his chair, sank slowly back until he felt the cushions enveloping his body, molding to his shape. \"So,\" he said, eventually, \"If I send this memo through, then-- according to you,\" he pointed at the second Alice, \"there will be no war, and the human race will bore itself to death. If, on the other hand, I withhold this memo, then _you_ say,\" He pointed at the ragged, and now rather pensive, first Alice, \"that there will come a world war which will destroy the human race. Whichever I choose, the human race doesn't seem to stand a chance.\"\nAlice one's brow furrowed, as she thought furiously. Turning to the rather flashily dressed Alice two, she said, \"I've been thinking. Maybe a war would be a good idea, after all-- at least then we go out with a bang-- a light show which aliens might point to in their skies. A kind of last funeral pyre for mankind.\"\nThe second Alice considered this a moment, before saying, \"No, I think no war would be better-- after all, humans _might_ recover from this period of apathy, you know...\"\n\"No-- war would be a good idea, we can re-build the world...\"\n\"Uh uh. No war is better, that way, there's no _need_ to rebuild!\"\nColin broke in, laughing, \"Ladies! Ladies!\" he shouted, \"You've both done a rapid volte-face, have you not? Why is this?\" He silenced their explanations with a wave of his hand,\" No, don't bother to lie - I can see it in your faces. You've both realized what has just become clear to me. If you had succeeded in your original mission, then my future would be altered. Your future would cease to exist: _you_ would no longer be `real.' Instead, your counterpart-- the woman you are arguing with at the moment-- would be in the `true' future. However, now your pleas are not so much for the human race-- that seems doomed either way-- but for your own existence.\"\nThe women looked sheepish. Colin was correct, and all of them knew it. Walking across the room, Colin replaced the poker-- which he found he was still gripping in his right hand-- in the stand beside the fire. He turned from the flames and, with a wry smile, stated,\n\"Well, I will toss a coin to decide which future shall come about. Does that seem reasonable to each of you?\" Reluctantly, they nodded. Colin took a quarter from his trouser pocket, then flipped it: \"Heads, war; tails, peace.\" Even raggedy Alice's cohorts stopped bickering over a toga, previously belonging to a now-unconscious cohort of the other Alice long enough to watch the coin come down. It span in the air, glinting brightly in the flames of Colin's real fire like a single phoenix feather before hurtling toward the carpet, and-- as it landed-- nobody in that room dared draw breath.\nThe coin landed on its edge.\n\"Well,\" came a familiar voice from a corner of the room. \"It seems the human race has a chance after all.\"\nRoy Stead is a research assistant in quantum astrophysics at the English University of Sussex.

Not that he was Valerie Jones waiting around to ask. He dropped the gun and loped away. He didn't have any fingerprints, and tracing the gun would only lead to a stolen shipment --- a dead end.\nHe switched the hand-computer on with a flick of his thumb and set to work dismantling the house security system. The heady scent of the lilac bushes beneath which he crouched filled his sensitive nose and made it twitch. Just don't sneeze, he reminded himself. Aston had a thing for lilacs... they ran rampant on his estate. You couldn't walk more than four feet in any direction without running into more of the accursed bushes. Just thinking about it made Jim's nose itch. He wondered how the dogs could stand it. Maybe their noses weren't as sensitive. His nose twitched again. It was a moot point, though, since the dogs were dead. That was the first thing he'd done, and the lilac smell was so strong their bodies probably wouldn't be found except by a visual search of the grounds. The security cameras were the scanning type, so they'd missed the whole show, and the infrareds couldn't tell him apart from the canines, though some diligent soul might notice the change in numbers as their bodies cooled. That was just a chance he had to accept. He scratched his still itching nose with light fingers, sniffling. They came away wet with the blood that still covered his face, and he licked each digit clean before he reached back into the gray box. He couldn't just say it was habit and instinct: he actually liked the taste of blood. Though if he thought about that for very long it would give him a case of the shivers.\nHalf an hour later, Jim paused and studied the grounds. Nothing moved save for an owl that swooped low over the lilacs in search of prey, though what it thought it could catch under the tall bushes he couldn't guess. The whisper of its wings parting the wind was a comfortable night sound, along with the crickets that had finally taken up their song around him. The guards down at the gate remained unaware, intent on their caffeine sticks and conversation. Jim couldn't quite make out the words from across the wide lawn, but he didn't care to. The soft click as he switched the keypad off silenced the crickets once more and their silence followed him like a wake as he removed the wire attachments, placed the computer back in his pouch, and crept toward the end of the house. The eighty-foot oak that grew there would grant him access to a third-story window. The giant tree had grown so close to the house that the branches were wearing grooves in the stone as they swayed in the wind. The house probably wouldn't be damaged if the tree came down on it, though, he mused. The crystal structure of the white stone had been developed for more than just beauty.\nThe window was latched from the inside, Jim noted, with a plain metal hook. Not a magnetic latch. He didn't think the house was that old, but maybe it was just an oddity, courtesy of the original owner. He tapped the pane gently.. The window was made of duraglass, which was actually a plastic, and a whole lot tougher than conventional safe glass. He'd brought tools to deal with either, since he hadn't been able to find out which one it was before hand. The duraglass melted nicely with the application of the right chemicals. Jim was glad for the stiff breeze that carried the acrid stench away from him. The smell was the price he paid for a low-temperature melt. If he were unlucky, however, that would be enough. He unlatched the window, then oiled the window tracks down with fluid from a small plastic tube. His claws bit deep into the bark as he braced himself and raised the window with barely a sound. Good thing, too. A girl slept in the white, fluffy bed that dominated the room. That would be Aston's daughter, he knew. Maybe she liked the noise of the oak tree, or, better yet, liked lilacs no better than he. Their saccharine perfume was not so overwhelming here. Well, she'd be able to uproot every single one of the hideous purple-splotched bushes if she chose soon enough, he thought as he stepped through the window. He stood balanced on the sill to survey the room. The girl was asleep, her breathing deep and even. She clutched an Altered Gladiators doll in her sleeping arms and Jim had the distinct impression that the glass eyes above the drooling snarl were staring directly at him. Nothing else stirred amid the soft piles of stuffed toys and strewn clothes. He bounded to the floor without a sound save the spongy crunch of the thick carpet under his paws. The long, dexterous fingers of his hands were folded under so that he was actually walking on his knuckles and, as he padded across the room, those hands were indistinguishable from paws.\nShadow silent, Jim slipped through the halls. Most of the forty-two room house was in darkness. That was good. Aston ought to be in his office still, which was on the second floor, north end. The floor plan flitted through his mind. There should be two guards wandering somewhere inside as well, but those didn't bother Jim unduly. He would hear them coming long before they heard him.\nHe stopped at the top of the stairs. This would be a good place for additional security, though the plans hadn't held any mention of another system. The staircase was isolated, walled on both sides with carved wood panelling. Rosarian's work, he thought, though art wasn't his specialty. The carved protuberances would provide good hiding places for laser sensors on both sides of the stairs. Jim pulled a small, illegal aerosol from his pouch and sprayed the air before him. A fine net of red laser beams dissected the empty space up to about waist height on a normal human, fading to invisibility as the mist settled. If they followed the same pattern all the way down the staircase, he'd be fine. He could leap them. Coming back up would be the problem. He checked once more for signs of weapons mounted into the walls, saw none. The ceiling looked clean, too. He stopped to listen, then backed up and took a running leap off the top of the staircase. His compact, four-legged body sailed easily through empty space, landing in the downstairs hallway with an unavoidable thump. Twohundred and twenty pounds could not land silently after that kind of jump.\nBefore he moved on, he stopped to sit back on his haunches. Reaching into the pouch strapped across his stomach, he pulled out a black plastic gun. The bulb of the silencer at the business end made it somewhat unwieldy, but he clamped it between his jaws and loped toward Aston's office. As he turned the corner, he heard footsteps in the distance behind him, moving slowly. The guards were being careful. He would have plenty of time.\nLight leaked from beneath the door to Aston's office, warm and inviting. That door would hiss as it slid open, he knew, so he took the gun in his hand and settled onto his haunches once again. That was the only position from which he could shoot. Genetic curse, which was why he rarely depended on guns. But in this case it just made the most sense. He reached up and slapped the door pad, taking aim through the doorway as the door slid aside. Terrence Aston sat behind a wide redwood desk, his attention on the terminal screen built into the top. He looked up just as Jim fired, and Jim was never certain whether Aston even saw his killer. Not that he was waiting around to ask. He dropped the gun and loped away. He didn't have any fingerprints, and tracing the gun would only lead to a stolen shipment ...- a dead end.\nThere would be a second set of stairs further down the hall, he knew. Speed was his best protection, now. He found the other staircase and raced up it, triggering a blaring alarm that filled the house. The upstairs hall was empty, and he ran the length of it, not pausing as he streaked through the end bedroom and out the window. He registered the white face and staring eyes of the girl as he ran past. His head was filled with the smell of oak bark and the drifting scent of lilacs, the metal sounds of guns being readied, and the shouts of men. He ran headlong down the tree trunk, counting on his claws to hold him to its rough surface, and sprinted toward the fence at a point three hundred and four yards from the gate. He'd actually measured it during his preparations. The floodlights lit up just as he reached the electrified fence, illuminating the entire estate, and blinding him. He leapt anyway, depending on natural ability to carry him safely over.\nThe memory returned to Jim as a whole, filled with the scents and sounds of that night, as he stared at the woman across from him. The little girl was long gone, replaced by a firm, mature intelligence dressed impeccably in a floor length blue silk skirt, yellow silk blouse, and obi. The blouse might have been peach or even a creamy white, Jim thought absently. His vision was based on shades of light and dark, more than color.\n\"Konichi wa Mr. Leary.\" The soft voice was very proper and melodious, completely at odds with the black eyes that bored directly into his. \"I assume you know who I am?\"\n\"Of course, Councillor,\" Jim answered, nodding. Though he had never put her picture together with that night at the Aston estate before. Twenty years was a long time, though the emergence of another Councillor Aston should have pricked his memory.\nJulee Lin Aston continued to stare at him, lost in private thoughts. Jim figured he could probably guess what some of them were. No doubt she had never seen anyone Altered so extremely before. Not even the Gladiators on the viewer. They, at least, still resembled human beings despite the ridiculous musculature and occasional fur. That was the standard reaction. He glanced at his reflection in the darkened windows that fronted the restaurant. Black as night, he was barely visible against the dark street, save for the sheen of light that rippled across his fur. In form, he was nearly identical to the black panther of the Asian jungles. A bit larger, perhaps, with only his limber five-fingered hands and versatile brain to distinguish him from his feline cousins.\n\"You paid a large handful of yen to arrange this meeting, Councillor,\" Jim reminded her, annoyed. The words rumbled out of a throat that was not designed for language.\n\"Of course.\" She regained her composure and took a breath. Jim noted the effect that had on the thin fabric of her blouse with discreet interest. \"I have a proposition for you.\" Jim's ears twitched, though his feline face betrayed nothing. Very few facial expressions were possible for him, which he had always considered an asset.\n\"There have been two attempts on my life, Mr. Leary,\" she continued without preamble. \"Both occurred at my estate. Both were nearly successful.\"\nJim eyed her warily. It sounded like an accusation. Despite the fact that he had chosen this meeting place, he was far from confident. There were fifteen Councillors who governed Jap-Am, and Julee Aston was the first woman ever to hold that position in the colony's history. She was no push over.\nHe kept diligent track of the traffic through the small restaurant. Most of the faces at nearby tables were familiar because Jim had hired them. But that didn't mean much. A Councillor had vast resources. If she wanted him dead, and knew who to hire, he might as well get ready to meet the man in black. Anyone could be assassinated.\n\"So what do you want from me?\" Jim asked.\nJulee leaned forward. \"I want to hire you, Mr. Leary. Your particular... talents... would make you exceptionally qualified to handle my personal security.\" She betrayed no emotion.\nJim felt his insides go cold. \"I think you overestimate me, Councillor.\"\n\"I haven't,\" she assured him. \"I'm willing to pay.\" She named a figure that was generous. Very generous. But not enough to be a mockery. When he said nothing, she continued in a sudden change of subject, \"There were four attempts on my father's life at the estate. Two never made it into the house, and the third died in the downstairs hall. But the fourth... the fourth was exceptional.\" She sat back in her chair. \"I need that kind of exceptional talent working for me.\" She sipped her drink, the glass catching the light and bursting into rainbow hued stars.\n\"My father died a long time ago, Mr. Leary,\" she continued after setting the glass down. \"I'm interested in survival, not vengeance.\" She met Jim's gaze squarely, as if daring him to admit it.\n\"As I said before, I think you overestimate me,\" Jim replied.\n\"Then you're not interested?\"\nUnfortunately, Jim was. He needed the money, and offers that size didn't come by very often. But the very root of his temptation, he knew, was the simple fact that he held some respect for this Councillor. She had made herself the champion of the Altereds, against stiff opposition. But the fact that she knew it was him that night was highly unsettling.\nJim sighed. \"All right. Count me in.\" He was surprised to see her smile, but it was somehow an enigmatic expression. \"I'll come to the house tomorrow.\" He stood and prepared to jump down from his chair.\n\"Um- Mr. Leary? There's one more thing.\" Now she seemed almost embarrassed. \"All of my employees swear an oath of allegiance.\"\nJim looked at her and shrugged. Why not? Oaths held power in a court, but, being who and what he was, he would be dead long before he ever saw the inside of a courthouse. Reaching across the table he laid his hand over hers and quickly repeated the necessary words. It was somehow both more and less than just a legal ceremony.\nCity towers scrolled by the car's darkened window as Julee kicked off her shoes with a sigh. She did not notice the steady rumble of the billowing air that held the hovercar aloft; she had ridden in hovercraft all her life. But she did hear the sound of Jim's fur against the leather seats as the tip of his tail twitched with inner disquiet.\n\"What is it?\" she asked, her eyes going to the windows and the view beyond, seeking an unnamed danger. They were on their way home from the latest in a long series of Council sessions where Julee continued to argue strenuously for the creation of a council seat to represent Altereds. She was making slow headway against Councillor Tanaki's purist thinking.\n\"Bad feeling.\" Jim did not look at her. His eyes continued to roam the streetsides visible through the bulletproof plastic of her private car. He could see the top of their driver's head over the back of his seat, and a portion of the snub-nosed automatic rifle mounted on the dash. Yeng was a good man, but not as familiar with the Councillor's car as Jim might have wished. Ned Chang, the regular driver had come in so sick that morning that Jim had ordered him back to bed, and Yeng was the best he could find to fill in. They were sandwiched between two armored cruisers, each carrying three guards, but that didn't provide more than basic security. The convoy followed the route Jim had chosen only the night before through San Louis' crowded riverfront district, and through the buildings he caught brief glimpses of the Mississippi off to his right.\nAny information can be bought, Jim reminded himself, especially here in the capitol. He found himself searching his knowledge of the city, trying to guess where an attack might come from.\n\"Is this where you would have picked, if Tanaki had hired you to kill me?\" Julee asked curiously.\nJim froze, blindsided by the blunt question. Most people were far more discreet when they discussed his profession. He managed to swallow his surprise, grateful once again that his face carried little expression.\nHe wasn't sure why he answered with the truth. \"No. I'd probably hit the house.\" The \"again\" that belonged on the end of the sentence was left unvoiced. \"You don't know for certain that it's Tanaki,\" he added as an afterthought.\n\"Of course I do,\" she snapped. \"First he tried to bribe me to change my vote. Then he threatened me. Now he's trying to make good on his threats.\"\nJim had no chance to respond. His only indication of trouble was the squeal of old rubber tires on pavement as a sporty silver landcar sped down an access ramp and slewed across the lanes toward them. Jim grabbed Julee's shoulders and forced her down on the seat, below the level of the windows. He held her there as their car swerved violently. They felt the change as they crossed over the grass median, and dove into the midst of oncoming traffic on the other side of the highway. Proximity alarms blared all around them, then were drowned out by thunder as the silver landcar exploded. The force of the blast tipped their car over on its side, tumbling the two passengers in the rear compartment like rag dolls.\nWhen Jim's vision cleared and the ringing in his ears dropped to a sufferable level, he raised his head to look around. The car had somehow ended right-side up. Black smoke billowed around it, searing his eyes and nose with acrid grit. He and Julee were wedged together in the floorboard. She held onto him with a deathgrip, fingers knotted painfully into his short fur. A trickle of blood leaked from the corner of her mouth where her lip had split, but her eyes were open.\nHeart pounding, Jim urged her up onto the seat with a caution to stay down. Julee released him with a spasmodic jerk, then obeyed. A fleeting expression of revulsion crossed her face. Cold inside from more than fear, Jim climbed to his feet and peered through the broken window into the smoke. He could see figures moving beyond the heat shimmer but couldn't identify them. The sudden rattle of automatic gunfire decided him.\n\"Can you run?\" he asked Julee.\nShe nodded uncertainly. \"I think so.\"\n\"Good, then stay low and don't stop until I tell you to. Head for that building.\" He pointed to a tower whose side could be seen rising above the smoke. \"I'll follow you.\" He studied the tower a moment more, wondering if that was where the landcar had been controlled from. If it hadn't been a kamikaze hit. Which it might easily have been, with a Councillor as the target.\nAt his command, Julee took off across the highway, doing a credible sprint in her stocking clad feet. Jim followed at her heels, nipping at her thigh to urge her on as bullets scored the pavement beside them. He got an impression of wrecked and burning cars, with several men using them as cover from which to snipe at each other. He could not guess who was alive and who was dead from among the Councillor's staff, nor how many of their attackers might remain.\nThey reached the edge of the highway and Jim guided his charge down among the smaller streets that ran between the buildings. The sooner they lost themselves, the sooner they would lose the men that pursued them, Jim thought, though he knew the area well. He had seen two figures following them, for certain.\nJulee's breath was coming in ragged gasps. She had barely slowed, but he knew that she would have to stop soon. They turned onto a new street and Jim spied what he had been looking for. Cracked cement stairs led down below street level, into a basement that had been the foundation of a building that was built before the Japanese conquest. A new building had been raised on the site, on top of the old basement. It would give them a shortcut over to the next street, and perhaps confuse their pursuers. The basement was dark, but Jim's eyes used light far more efficiently than a normal human. He guided Julee through the fallen supports and tumbled bricks with nudges and an occasional growled word. They emerged on the street, apparently without company. Jim turned them back toward the river. There were some high-class restaurants in that direction. The Councillor's face would get them in, he reasoned, and the establishment security would keep them safe until her people could pick them up.\nThey reached the Tea Room just as their pursuers found them again. But it was too late. Julee spoke a quick word to the maitre'd and they were in. Jim watched the men on the street fade away and sighed in relief. He was shaking from the adrenaline coursing through his system, but forced his body to move normally.\nEvery eye followed them as they made their way to a table near the back of the restaurant. It was in unspoken accord that they took a table against the wall. Jim felt the stares boring into him. They were covert stares, for this crowd was too polite to stare openly, but Jim felt the stigma just as sharply. He was different. They looked at him and saw an animal, not a man.\nWaiters brought saki, and a cloth to wipe the blood from Julee's mouth. Conversations began to pick up around them. Jim tried to ignore the eyes as he sipped his saki. The maitre'd had already made the call to Julee's estate so they had nothing to do but wait. They did so in silence.\nJulee looked up with a small start as Jim and another man entered the office.\n\"Have you found something?\" she asked.\nJim hopped up into the chair that was pulled up against the far side of the desk. He carried a rolled sheaf of papers gently in his mouth, which he dropped onto the chair seat before answering. \"Maybe. Dan, tell her what you found out.\"\nDan Erickson was a tall, sandy-haired man with a permanently mournful expression. His dislike for his boss was apparent in every line of his body, but he was loyal to the Councillor, so he made the effort to ignore it.\n\"The car was driven by a Mr. Rani Nataru, age 42. He has been a member of Councillor Tanaki's house staff for eighteen years.\"\nJulee's eyebrows rose. \"That's not something?\"\nJim tipped his head to the side in a gesture equivalent to a shrug. \"Not really.\"\n\"Tanaki is claiming that Nataru was acting completely on his own.\" Dan added. \"And he has some evidence...- a tape of a conversation that took place in Tanaki's suite at the Capitol building. There's no way to know if it was a setup, of course, but I'd guess so. Either that, or he got lucky.\"\nJulee tapped a fingernail against the glossy wood of the desk. \"Well, no help there. Are you still tracing the car?\" The question was directed at Jim.\n\"And the explosives,\" he answered, \"but that'll take a few days, at least.\"\nJulee nodded. \"I understand. Thank you, gentlemen.\"\nAt a pointed glance from Jim, Dan scowled and left. Jim picked up the sheaf of papers and laid them out flat on the desk. The logo at the top indicated that they were printouts from one of the less reputable news services.\n\"I thought you might want to see this.\" His tone was studiously neutral.\n\"See what?\" Julee picked up the papers and read the headline: \"Councillor Aston and Altered Lover Exposed.\" Beneath the caption was a picture of the two of them at the Tea Room.\n\"Wonderful. More fuel to add to Tanaki's fire.\" Julee tossed the sheets back onto the desk with a wordless expression of disgust and leaned back in her chair. \"Now he's going to use this to try to convince the Council that I'm...-\" She broke off, uncertain how to finish.\n\"A pervert?\" Jim supplied.\n\"No!\" Julee straightened abruptly. \"That's not what I meant.\"\n\"But it is what you were thinking.\" Bitterness pooled in the pit of his stomach. \"Admit it, Councillor.\"\nJulee said nothing, her lips pressed together in a thin white line, but her eyes snapped dangerously. The tips of Jim's long canines showed white against his black fur as he met the Councillor's stare. Eventually, she looked away.\n\"Let me know when you learn something new, Mr. Leary.\" Julee's voice was faint and her eyes distant when she looked back at him.\nJim jumped down from the chair and padded to the door. As it slid aside, he paused and turned.\n\"Goodnight, Councillor.\" The subtle mockery in his words echoed old memories and hollow promises. He had lived with them all his life. No matter what people said, they always hated down deep, always feared.\nHe turned again and left before Julee had a chance to reply.\nJim perched on the edge of the massive work table, silent and unmoving. He had come in his usual way (which changed every time), and waited patiently for the man across the room to notice him. Had he possessed facial expression, a small, mischievous smile would have played about his lips.\nThe man finally located the part he was looking for amid the neat trays that lined the far wall and turned, only to do a violent doubletake and nearly drop the intricate metal thing he was holding.\n\"Leary! Don' do that! You nearly gave me a heart attack, man.\"\n\"`Lo Snake.\" Jim held out a lightly clenched fist, claws retracted, and Snake tapped his knuckles with a similar fist, grinning. That grin was a sight to see, Jim thought with a private chuckle. Snake only had two teeth...- long curved fangs that hung out of his mouth. Those, and the colored scales that covered his body in geometric patterns, gave Snake his name.\n\"You ain't been `round much lately,\" Snake said. The words were a bit slurred because of the overhanging teeth, but understandable enough. Poison sacks on either side of Snake's neck pulsed rhythmically. That was one reason Snake didn't get much trouble. The other was his size. Even Jim would hesitate before taking him on. The man was built like a tree. Jim guessed that his ancestors must have been Negroid: his face had that general cast, though it was almost lost amid the strangeness. Snake was among the most highly Altered, like Jim himself.\n\"Been busy.\" Jim walked across the table, picking his way with dainty steps through the clutter, to examine the mass of plastic and wires that Snake was working on. His nose was assailed by the tangy scents of cold-bonding glue, plastic, and carbon composite, and the musty smell of plastique. He found a clear space and sat down. From the pouch at his waist he drew a burned, melted tangle and held it out to Snake.\n\"This your work?\"\nSnake took the mess and poked at it, holding it under the magnifying lamp that hung drunkenly over his workspace.\n\"Yeah, it's mine. How'd ya know?\"\nJim shrugged. \"Fancy detonator. You and Coleman are the only ones that do that kind of stuff locally.\"\nSnake tossed the burnt detonator onto the table. \"So what about it?\"\nJim laid several colorful bills down next to it. \"Who'd you make it for?\"\nSnake fingered the bills. Then he snorted and picked them up. \"Some suit.\"\n\"Did he give you a name?\"\n\"Course not. Paid in cash, though. No credit transfer.\"\n\"What did he look like?\" Jim picked up the detonator and put it back in his carry pouch.\nSnake shrugged. \"Pretty tall. Lots of americana in'm. Brown hair, black eyes.\"\n\"Is he the one that made the pickup?\"\n\"Na. Little Japanese guy.\"\nJim dug back into his pouch and brought out a picture of Nataru. \"This him?\"\nSnake glanced at it and nodded. \"That's him.\"\nJim shifted positions with care, trying to ease the ache in his hips. He was lying prone on the metal bar that supported one of a row of lights that illuminated Julee Aston on the stage below him. It was the best vantage point he could find in the small auditorium, allowing him to keep the Councillor in view at all times, as well as see into both wings and out into the audience. But it was a precarious perch.\nThe Councillor was speaking to a group of students at Washington University and Jim was nervous. Public addresses were scheduled months in advance, and gave an assassin plenty of time to prepare. Not that it mattered, really. Tanaki's people could only have had twelve hours notice, at most, for that last attempt, and they'd nearly succeeded. The timing on that one still bothered him, though in the month since, he had not been able to find anything concrete with which to back his instincts.\nJulee's voice interrupted his thoughts and he focused on her for a moment. The powerful lights brought out blue highlights from her raven hair and made the silk of her dress shimmer.\n\"How long, ladies and gentlemen, will we make the children pay for the sins of the parents?\" she asked the audience. \"How long will we condemn the Altered to be less than citizens? Are they inferior to us? No, they are not. They have minds and feelings just like yours or mine.\n\"Are they different?\" She paused, considering. \"Yes, they're different. But is that bad? I'm sure your grandmothers will tell you that they're cursed by the gods, or some such nonsense. That's what my grandmother used to tell me. But you and I know better.\n\"We know that the Altereds that we see today are the unfortunate descendants of men and women who perverted nature. They tried to be gods, playing with things they had no right to alter. But that was two-hundred years ago. And the DNA codes that those careless men and women broke, we still cannot mend.\n\"Is that the fault of the children? They did not choose to be what they are. No.\" Her voice died to a bare murmur, so that everyone in the auditorium strained to hear.\n\"It is our fault, ladies and gentlemen. Ours. It was people just like you and I that allowed the Alterations to happen.\"\nJim shook his head and tried to regain his bearings. He made a quick sweep of the auditorium and stage, amazed at how entranced he had been by the Councillor's words. But they were words he desperately wanted to hear. He was almost willing not to care whether she truly meant what she said, just to hear it. Almost. A cold, cynical voice deep inside reminded him of her reaction when they had been pressed against each other on the floor of her car.\n\"Got a possibility, boss.\" The voice was fed to Jim by a tiny microphone clipped to the edge of one triangular ear. That was Tony. Of all of the Councillor's employees, Tony was the only one who really didn't seem to care that Jim walked on four legs and had fur. But Tony's eyes were a pale shade of lavender, without irises. He understood the stigma.\n\"Where?\" Another microphone was attached to a collar around Jim's neck. His eyes scanned the auditorium below him.\n\"Out in the hall right now. Heading backstage. He's a tall man, mid thirties, wearing a brown leather jacket with fur trim.\"\n\"Thanks Tony. Seal off the backstage area.\" The last was a command directed to all of the Councillor's guards who were linked to him via radio. \"Bull, Erickson, cut him off.\"\nJim watched the two men move forward to intercept the visitor who was not yet visible to Jim because of a curtained wall that hung in the way. The man rounded the corner at a casual stroll and stopped when he saw the Councillor's guards. Alarms went off in Jim's head. The man below him was named Derek Van der Voehnn. He was a walking funeral. Jim had only met him once, years before, when they'd both been hired for the same hit by different parties.\nThe alarm bells kept ringing. This wasn't Van der Voehnn's style. He was a sharpshooter. He'd never walk backstage for a close up. And he'd certainly never let himself be stopped by a couple of bodyguards.\nJim whipped around, searching frantically for Julee. She still stood at the podium, oblivious to all but her audience. Jim's motion sensitive eyes searched the room. The audience watched her in rapt silence as she drew the speech to a close, save for one small shadowed figure in the second row that rose to its feet and raised a hand to shoulder height, arm outstretched. Jim didn't wait to see the gun...- he leapt from his perch, crashing into the Councillor and carrying her to the ground behind the podium. The gunshot was thunderous in the still quiet room.\nPandemonium broke out as Jim yelled instructions through the microphone at his throat.\nJulee groaned and shook her head dizzily as Jim staggered to his feet and peered around the edge of the podium. The assassin had her back turned (Jim was almost certain it was a woman), and was pushing her way through the panicked crowd toward the doors at the back of the auditorium. She hadn't gotten very far yet. Jim launched himself at the retreating form, claws gouging the polished wood floor of the stage as he scrabbled for purchase. Alerted to his approach somehow, the woman turned just as he leapt off the edge of the stage. Her eyes widened and she squeezed off an instinctive shot before he plowed into her. They tumbled to the floor in a tangle of limbs, taking several others down with them in the press of bodies. Jim knocked the gun out of her hand with a swipe of a paw, leaving bloody welts. She yelped in pain, but didn't try to fight when she felt the prick of the other set of claws at her throat.\n\"How do you feel?\" Julee asked as the house physician finished the last stitch. The bullet had sliced through the top of Jim's shoulder, leaving a bloody, but not serious, gash. He was lying on the velour couch in Julee's office, chin on paw, with the nap of the fabric tickling his nose.\n\"As good as I look, no doubt,\" he answered. \"You?\" A fair-sized bruise was beginning to spread across her cheek. She grinned and winced as the gesture stretched abused tissues.\n\"About the same.\" She cradled her left arm protectively. She would be sore for a long time, though she hadn't done any real damage. \"We had to turn the assassin over to the police. The Council demanded it.\"\n\"Meaning Tanaki.\"\n\"Who else?\"\nThe doctor interrupted to give Jim some final instructions and a sheet of pain tabs. Silence fell behind him as he left the room.\nJim sighed and allowed his eyes to sag shut. \"What about Van der Voehnn?\"\n\"Who?\" She was startled.\nJim lifted his head and turned to look at her. \"The man backstage.\"\nAt her blank look he said, \"Is Dan still around? I need to talk to him.\"\n\"I'll see.\" Julee climbed stiffly to her feet and left the room. She glanced over her shoulder at Jim as she did, a puzzled expression on her face.\nJim dozed until the door hissed open and Dan Erickson walked in, with Julee on his heels. \"The Councillor said you wanted to see me.\"\n\"Yeah.\" Jim shook his head to clear the cobwebs. \"What happened to Van der Voehnn?\"\nDan looked over at Julee, who did not return the gaze. \"We let him go.\"\n\"You what?\"\n\"We didn't have any reason to keep him. He said he was looking for you.\" His tone was vaguely accusing.\nJim digested that in surprise, and some alarm. \"Strange time for him to come looking,\" he growled. Dan shrugged.\n\"All right. That's what I wanted to know.\" Jim laid his head back down, too tired to fight the other man's obstinacy. After a moment, Dan took the hint and left.\nJulee resumed her seat on the floor next to the couch. \"Who's Van der Voehnn?\"\n\"An assassin. One of the best.\"\n\"Oh.\" She did not sound terribly alarmed.\n\"You should be more concerned, Councillor. He's very good.\" Jim raised his head to look directly into her eyes. But whatever expression was there remained closely guarded. He snorted in private disgust and dug one of the bright red pain tabs out of its plastic bubble. The pill wouldn't take effect for another ten minutes, but that was all right. He could wait a little longer. He laid his head back down and closed his eyes. He hurt too much to think.\n\"Hey, boss. Wake up.\" Tony's round face swam into view as Jim blinked and moaned. He was a mass of pain, and the bright morning sun streaming through the windows did not help his temperament.\n\"What is it?\" He rolled onto his stomach, rubbing at the sleep that matted the inner corners of his eyes.\n\"The Councillor said it'd be all right to wake you. I think I've got a line on the guy that paid for the explosives.\"\nJim sat up with interest. \"Go on.\"\nTony produced a photo and handed it to Jim. \"Name's Eddie Blake. He's done freelance for Tanaki before.\"\nJim took the picture and studied it. \"I'll see what my friend thinks.\"\nUnfortunately, Snake wasn't home. Jim grumbled to himself, shoulder already aching from the long walk. But he wasn't willing to give away the lab's location to Julee's staff, so he took to the afternoon shadows, limping and muttering. There was one other thing he wanted to check out.\nCarylon's was almost empty at that time of day, seeming stale and somehow sterile without the mass of flesh that rippled and gyrated across the floor during the hours of darkness. The band was onstage, practicing, and Jim winced at the squeal of electronic pipes.\nJim nodded to the guy behind the bar and headed backstage. He was a familiar sight at Carylon's, though not as much so recently. He padded past cracked cement walls and felt the chill of the floor through the soft pads on his feet. The air smelled of old smoke and old sweat, alcohol and urine, and beneath it all, the scent of human sensuality that only Jim's sensitive nose could pick up. It was a familiar smell, comforting simply because he had known it all his life. Here, he knew the rules, and knew his place.\nHe scratched lightly on Carylon's door, taking care not to mar the plastic. She called for him to enter and he did. She sat crosslegged on the bed, shimmering material cascading around her and an intense look of concentration on her delicate face as she repaired the tear in one of her costumes. The club was hers, but she had made herself poor to buy it. Jim wasn't certain whether he thought that was a wise move or not.\n\"Well, you haven't been around much lately.\" She set the pile of fabric aside, clearing a space for him.\n\"I need to ask a favor.\" He leapt up beside her. The small welcoming smile died, and he wondered if things had gone bad for her.\n\"What kind?\"\n\"I need to arrange a meet. Here, preferably.\"\n\"Everybody walks away?\" Her gaze was skeptical.\n\"It's not a hit.\" He knew better than that. The one time he'd tried to use her club, he'd paid dearly for it, friends or no.\nCarylon thought a moment, then shrugged. \"Okay.\"\nJim leaned across her to punch a button on the phone. He entered a number and spoke briefly to the man who answered.\n\"How long `til you get an answer?\" Carylon dragged long, painted fingernails along the line of his jaw as he cut the connection. Jim looked into her hazel eyes once before closing his eyes and submitting, almost involuntarily, to the caress. He still didn't know why she liked him, except that she seemed to have a thing for Altereds. He never asked. And, most of the time, it didn't matter, anyway.\nDerek Van der Voehnn wove his way deftly through the writhing crowd towards the small side table Jim had claimed. Jim had been honestly surprised when he agreed to the meeting, and now had the disturbing feeling that he didn't quite know everything that was going on.\nVan der Voehnn dropped gracelessly into an empty chair and folded his fingers together on the table before him. He seemed, to Jim, to be built entirely of angles, with skin thrown over his frame only as an afterthought. But his eyes were keen and belied the air of gangly adolescence that surrounded him.\nHe was grinning. \"I'll bet you want to know what I was doing at Councillor Aston's speech, right?\"\nJim nodded. \"That'd be a good place to start.\" He tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice, not knowing how Van der Voehnn would interpret it. This wasn't the tack he'd expected the man to take. It made him nervous.\n\"It was a coincidence, you know. That I was there when the hit went down. I really was looking for you. You're a hard man to find, sometimes.\" His tongue tripped over the word \"man,\" as if he considered for a moment using a different one.\nJim tried to ignore it. \"I'm listening.\"\nVan der Voehnn's lips quirked in a smile. He seemed genuinely entertained by Jim's skepticism. \"Well, this one's a freebie, since I got the better end of the deal the last time.\" Van der Voehnn had gotten the hit, and the money, and Jim had nearly gotten killed because of the confusion. It wasn't a memory Jim cherished. But now he was definitely interested.\nVan der Voehnn must have read it in him. His smile widened, then disappeared. \"I just thought you might like to know that Councillor Aston tried to hire me for a job about six months ago.\" That would put it approximately two and a half months before Jim had started working for her.\n\"Who was the mark?\"\n\"You, of course.\" He grinned again, enjoying Jim's sudden shock. \"I turned it down. Too much work for the money. I don't know if she made the offer to anyone else, but the answer would've been the same, probably. At least for the professionals. Since you're spending so much time with the lady, I figured you deserved a warning.\"\n\"Yeah, thanks.\" Jim felt like he'd just been hit with a baseball bat. Stunned and disoriented. \"You didn't exactly rush to tell me this,\" he added, as soon as he recovered his wits.\nVan der Voehnn shrugged. \"Didn't know you were working for Aston until a few weeks ago. And I didn't really want to let the Councillor know that I'd talked to you. Could be bad for my health, y'know? I just picked a bad time.\" He stood, though perhaps unfolded might be a better word, Jim thought, and left without another word. The abrupt departure was the perfect ending to the disturbing conversation, chilling Jim to the bone.\n\"Are you planning to ignore me again today, Mr. Leary?\" Julee's voice was sharp, annoyed.\nJim glanced at her and growled. It had not been a good few days. Snake had identified the man who had purchased the explosives as Eddie Blake, the freelancer that worked for Tanaki. That was no surprise, really. Now Jim was left with the task of confronting Blake, except that he didn't quite know how to go about it. Somewhere, there was a traitor on the Councillor's staff, but he didn't know where to look, didn't know who he could trust. And to top it off, the Councillor herself had suddenly become an enemy, at least in his eyes. All of which left him in a very sour mood. Part of him wanted to simply cut his losses and leave before he got himself killed, but he found that he couldn't, because he had sworn an oath of allegiance and couldn't betray it until he knew for sure.\nWell, at least he could do something about Blake, though it wasn't a particularly inspired idea. Ignoring the black eyes that remained on him, he unfolded the portable phone in his hands and punched a number. Dan Erickson answered.\n\"Go ahead and pick up Blake,\" Jim told him.\n\"Right.\" Dan cut the connection. He was hardly friendly, Jim mused, but his original hostility had faded. It was an unaccustomed relief.\nDan and two others brought Eddie Blake to the estate in less than an hour. They had kept surveillance on him since they'd learned his name, but Jim hadn't wanted to rush into anything unless Blake tried to leave suddenly. Letting him roam free hadn't helped, to Jim's disappointment. The man had kept mostly to himself, except to make a nightly foray into the crowded jumble of people and lights that filled the bars along the streets of the Dug. He had even spent part of an evening at Carylon's.\nBlake was an addict. The glaze of Silverdust was in his eyes, and his clothes reeked from the smoke. Jim observed from behind a pane of one-way glass while Dan and a man named Chow Fong tossed questions and threats at the hapless Blake. It wasn't a very productive session: Yes, he'd contacted Snake, no, he didn't know who the blast was meant for until after the fact. Tanaki had hired him in person and paid in cash, like always. No, he didn't know if there was another hit planned... nobody had contacted him for anything.\nEventually, Jim turned him loose. He was fairly certain the man was too much of a coward to have hidden anything important from them. Then he spent a long time pacing the length of the estate's formal living room, past the empty fireplace, while he thought.\nThe woman shooter had turned up dead, not three hours after the police put her in a cell at the Justiary. Tony had brought him the news while they were questioning Blake. He cursed again the politics that had kept them from being able to talk to her, and himself, for not pushing her before the police arrived.\nJulee Aston entered the room with a muted swish of her long skirt over the plush, cream-colored carpeting. She held a glass of brandy in either hand as she came over and settled into a corner of the long couch, her skirt a splash of bright color against its paleness. The coffee table in front of her was carved from some black stone, with a single gray flaw staggering artfully across the polished surface. She set Oone of the brandies on the table's edge nearest the place where Jim paced. It clinked loudly in the otherwise silent room. The other she sipped with the bowl cupped in both hands. Jim paused in his pacing, watching her. With her toes tucked up under her on the couch seat and her long hair spilling about her shoulders, she had an oddly childish air, and he remembered the wide, terrified eyes that had followed him through the darkness of her bedroom that night so long ago.\n\"So what did I do to make you so angry?\" she asked him, her gaze boring steadily and calmly into his above the rim of her glass. Again he was struck by how little of that child remained in her eyes.\n\"Does it matter?\" The tip of his tail twitched spasmodically from side to side.\n\"Of course it does.\" She set her glass down and folded her arms across her stomach. \"The next time someone tries to kill me, I don't want you hesitating because I did something that angered you.\" A small, wry smile accompanied her words.\nJim sat down where he was and curled his tail around his body. The tip of that tail, which he could not control, thumped against the floor in time to his thoughts.\n\"You tried to hire Van der Voehnn to kill me.\"\nSurprise flickered across her face for a moment, then she sighed. \"I was afraid you were going to find out about that.\" She reached out and took another sip of brandy.\n\"Is there an active contract?\"\n\"No,\" she answered without looking up from her glass.\nJim wasn't certain why he believed her, but he did. He didn't often get suckered by beautiful women, and hoped that he wasn't making that mistake now. Julee Aston was far to dangerous to misjudge.\nAfter a prolonged silence, Julee spoke. \"I hated you for a very long time,\" she said softly. Her eyes touched his briefly, then shied away. \"No one believed me when I told them about you, and for a while I wondered if maybe I hadn't made it all up, or dreamed it, maybe.\"\n\"When I reached majority and gained control of the estate, I decided that I had to find out.\" A cynical expression touched her small features. \"You should be flattered. I spent a lot of money trying to find you. But I didn't have any luck. Not for years.\"\nShe fell silent once again, and Jim wisely said nothing. He wasn't certain what he could say.\nJulee drained the last of her drink. \"I did finally find proof that you existed, just about the time Tanaki made the first attempt on my life. At first, all I wanted was to make sure you died. That's when I talked to Mr. Van der Voehnn. When he refused, I got\ufffdscared. I wondered if Tanaki might hire you.\" Jim found himself staring into the dark pools of her eyes and saw fear twisting beneath their calm surface. \"I knew you could do it. So I figured I'd hire you first.\"\n\"Why didn't you have me, or Van der Voehnn, for that matter, hit Tanaki?\" Jim was acutely aware of just how openly he was speaking. If there were a microphone in the room, he was dead. But he felt compelled to say the words anyway.\nJulee's eyes flared wide with surprise, as if she had never considered it. And she probably hadn't, Jim reflected sourly, at least not seriously. She didn't hate Tanaki... she only wanted to defeat him in the political arena. Their enmity was purely business.\nJim read the truth in her expression and shook his head in disgust. \"You've got a screwed set of standards, lady.\" He watched anger darken her face. \"What I did to your father is exactly what Tanaki is trying to do to you now. There's not a bit of difference.\"\n\"No.\" She was biting her lip, trying to control the rampage of her emotions. \"It's not the same.\"\n\"Why not?\" Jim knew he was hurting her, driving the nails of truth into her heart without regard for the wounds they would inflict. But his own anger spurred him. He wanted to hear the words... the real, underlying truth.\nHe came forward and leapt up on the couch. \"Why not?\" He flung the question at her again, at the face she had turned away from him. \"What makes me different from Tanaki?\"\n\"He... he was my father,\" she whispered.\n\"And your own life isn't as dear to you as his was?\" Jim's gravelly voice was scathing.\nA sob broke through the mask of her face, and she covered it with her hands, trembling. She had finally seen the truth of why she hated Jim so passionately, and even the real reason that she was compelled to assuage that subconscious guilt by championing the Altereds in Council. Bitter tears leaked from between her fingers.\n\"Get away from me,\" she ordered in a broken whisper. When he did not move, she looked up at him, her eyes full of agonized fury. \"Get away from me!\" Her voice still did not rise above a hoarse whisper.\n\"Why? So you can forget all about me and go on living your lie? You have no idea what it really means to be Altered.\" Jim already knew that the victory he had won was an empty one: he could feel the bitter echoes in his own heart. But the weight of the years, the pain and anger, were boiling out of him, and he could not stop himself.\nJulee turned away from him, but he knew that she listened as he described, in every ugly detail, what it meant to be Altered. The memories he had tried so long to bury rose up again: staggering through the streets in the rain, a starved, freezing kitten whose mother had thrown him out when he was barely four months old because she could no longer bear the sight of the child she had borne. Instinct had kept him alive until his human brain could develop... the hunter's instinct that let him catch roaches and beetles, and a keen nose that found the edible bits in the garbage that sat, stinking, in the alleyways. He remembered being driven away with kicks and curses from every place he had tried to take shelter in, either because they thought he was an animal or because he frightened the customers away. He remembered the government child custody house he was put in for a while. The stern nurses had given him decent food and a warm place to sleep, and even taught him the basics of reading and writing before the fear and loathing behind their eyes drove him out into the streets once again. He remembered being caught and beaten by the neighborhood gangs while he was still too small for his teeth and claws to be much defense, and he remembered turning tricks for the truly perverse, in exchange for a meal and a place to sleep for the night.\nWhen he had grown old enough, and strong enough, to hold his own on the street, he had found it sweetly satisfying to repay the gangs, the barmen and their bouncers, and anyone else who tried to hurt him, with teeth and claws. When the first offer had come to pay him to do what he was already doing, he hadn't thought twice about it. Eventually the money had gotten him off the street, given him comfort, women, even an education of sorts. He did not regret it.\nWhen he finished speaking, Julee was staring at the fingers clasped together in her lap, struggling to deny the truth of what he said. She had winced at every description of brutality he had thrown at her, but had not interrupted. Jim felt exhausted, drained. He had never exposed so much of himself to anyone and wondered why, of all people, he had done so to this one. It frightened him in a way he could not describe.\nEventually Julee looked up at him. A wan smile peeked from beneath her tears. \"We should form a club. Call it the Mutual Hate Society.\"\nSurprised, Jim smiled back. He wasn't sure why, but he found the joke humorous.\nThey remained that way for several minutes, wrapped in the silence of the late hour. Jim could hear the tread of the security guards elsewhere in the house as they made their rounds, and the sigh of the wind in the trees outside the window. The breeze that came to him was filled with the smells of damp earth and of the rain that would fall later that night. He noticed consciously for the first time that there were no lilacs.\nJulee rose in a whisper of silk. She was almost to the arched doorway that led to the stairs before she turned. \"Goodnight, Jim Leary.\"\nHe could not read the expression in her voice. \"Goodnight,\" he answered.\nShe left then, and Jim followed her with his ears as she made her way up the stairs to her bedroom. A few moments later he, too, left to seek his bed.\n\"Three days left until the vote.\" Julee closed up the keyboard on her desk and folded her arms over it. \"Do you think Tanaki will still try something?\"\nJim shrugged. \"Probably. The odds are getting long that you'll survive another attempt. Four is pretty impressive already.\"\n\"Thank you so much for the analysis, Mr. Expert. I really didn't want to hear that.\"\nJim grinned at her, showing a row of sharp teeth. The sarcasm had been playful rather than biting. In unspoken accord they did not mention their midnight conversation, but somehow it had shattered the formality of their relationship. Not that they were taking long walks in the garden together, or even working on a first name basis, but something had changed. Jim wasn't quite certain whether he liked it.\n\"I was trying to point out why I don't like the idea of you leaving the estate,\" he said.\n\"I know. But this meeting is too important to miss. An equal trade agreement with Hyundai\/Hwang would open some big doors for us back in Japan. Tanaki surely wouldn't try to hit me there... it's bad form.\"\nJim sighed, defeated. \"Well, the security's as tight as I can make it.\"\n\"Good.\" The portable phone Jim habitually carried with him rang before she could add anything else. Jim unfolded it and listened to the frantic voice on the other end.\n\"Sit tight and I'll meet you there,\" he said and closed the phone down.\nJulee lifted an eyebrow curiously.\n\"Either Eddie Blake is having a really bad trip, or he's scared enough to want to sell us some information,\" Jim said as he jumped down from his chair. \"He didn't know anything a week ago, so maybe he's learned something important. He's convinced Tanaki tried to off him.\n\"I'm going to meet him. It shouldn't take long to find out if he's running a game. So don't leave the estate until I get back.\"\nShe nodded and threw him a mock salute. \"Take care.\"\nHe found Blake exactly where he said he'd be, holed up in a smelly dive of a motel down in the Central West End. Blake had an old 12-gauge shotgun across his knees, and to Jim he looked very frightened, and very straight. Jim had spent twenty minutes watching the building, the room, and the man. If there was a trap, he couldn't spot it.\n\"So what's the word?\" he asked Blake while he surveyed the room from his momentary perch on the window sill.\nBlake tightened his grip on the shotgun. \"Here's the deal: you give me a plane ticket out of the colony, a little spending money, and enough protection to keep me alive to enjoy it, and I give you the name of the guy that's selling your Councillor out to Tanaki.\" His gaze darted nervously about the room.\nJim considered him. \"How do I know you've got the right name?\"\nDespair flickered in Blake's eyes. \"C'mon, man! They killed Isabella. She was one of Tanaki's regulars and she knew a lot about what he was doing. Maybe she even helped recruit this guy.\" Isabella was the woman who had shot at Julee Aston during her lecture.\n\"So why not you? That was almost two weeks ago.\"\n\"Man, `cause I didn't know anything!\" Blake was squirming like a restless child. \"That's the way it's always been. Tanaki pays good, tells me what to do, and I don't ask questions. I don't wanna know. But this time, I went up to the big house to pick up the rest of my money for another job... it didn't have anything to do with Councillor Aston... and I got there at the same time this guy did. It took me a minute to figure out who he was. I've seen him on the viewer a few times when the Councillor was on. So then I split. I figured if Tanaki'd kill Isabella, he'd sure kill me if he thought I knew about the guy.\"\nJim thought it over. The story was plausible, and even convincing. \"All right,\" he finally said. \"I'm willing to buy. Who is it?\"\nBlake shook his head. \"Nuh-uh. Not until I'm someplace safe.\"\n\"Will the Aston estate do? It'll take a while to arrange a flight and your money.\" Jim was beginning to wish Blake was as dumb as he looked.\nBlake nodded, and they left through the window and down the fire escape. Jim didn't want to take any chances while the hairs on his neck were bristling with unknown danger.\nThey reached the estate without incident. Jim took Blake to the basement and locked him into one of the holding cells that had been built there. No one saw Blake, as Jim had intended.\n\"I can't exactly let you roam about the estate,\" he explained to Blake when they reached the cell. \"This isn't the nicest of accommodations, but it will keep you safe and out of trouble until I get back.\"\nBlake submitted with the air of a doomed man. He had pretty much sold himself, and knew it.\n\"Now I want a name.\" Jim had kept his part of the bargain, and Blake was not in much of a position to argue.\n\"I don't actually know his name. He drives the Councillor's car. Short little guy that's got no hair.\"\nJim clamped his jaw shut on his surprise. Ned? But as he thought about it, it made sense. Ned had access to the gate key, and the first assassin had come in through the gate. Security had found the gate shorted, but that could be arranged from inside as well as out, and after the fact as easily as before. And Ned had been sick the morning that the car bomb had nearly taken them out. Jim himself had sent the man home, as he did anyone who was not operating at their peak. It had never occurred to him that the symptoms could have been faked.\nWith a rush of adrenaline, he realized that the Councillor's car had not been in it's spot when he had brought Blake in. He wasn't sure what time it was, but knew it couldn't be too late. He growled deep in his throat, unconsciously voicing his anger. The woman had left despite his orders! And Ned was driving her.\nJim locked Blake into his cell and then sprinted up the stairs, cursing as the half-healed wound in his shoulder lanced him with pain. He yelled for his staff as soon as he was out of the basement and explained the situation in a few terse sentences when they came at a run. They were in a car and heading out through the gate within two minutes, which pleased Jim in an unoccupied corner of his mind. The helo crew was also alerted, but it would be a few minutes more before they could get airborne.\nJim caught up the phone and dialed the Councillor's private number. The phone rang twice, then Julee's voice came to him from the other end, \"Hello?\"\n\"Hello, Councillor,\" Jim replied. \"This is a friendly conversation. Smile and nod, and pretend you're talking to one of your ladyfriends.\"\n\"What's going on?\" Her voice was light, but her sudden concern was clear beneath the false joviality.\n\"Is the divider up? Can Ned hear you?\"\n\"No, he can't. What's going on?\" She was more insistent this time.\n\"Laugh. Your ladyfriend just told you a joke.\" On the other end, he could hear her obey. \"Now,\" he continued, \"tell me where you are.\"\nA pause. \"Fifth and Old 70. Am I in trouble?\"\n\"Yes. Where are your escorts?\"\n\"My car blew out its hoverfan. One of the cars stayed with it and we transferred to the other one. I didn't want to be late.\"\nJim sucked in his breath. It couldn't have been an accident, could it? He was barely aware of the deep gouges his claws were ripping in the seat as he flexed them in response to the tension that gripped him.\n\"Who's in the car with you, and where are they?\" The armored escorts had two compartments: one in the front that also extended up into a small turret from which a gunner could fire, and a rear compartment buried in the belly.\n\"Ned's up in front with Dan and Xiao. I'm in the back. What is going on? Wait a minute. We're stopping.\"\nJim's heart leapt up into his throat. \"Where, Councillor? Where are you?\"\nAnother pause as she peered out through the viewing slits. \"We're still on Old 70. We must have crossed the bridge: there's nothing here but ruins.\" There was a note of fear in her voice.\n\"Put the phone down but don't hang up. Put it on the floor. We'll be there as soon as we can.\" Then, \"Old 70 across the river,\" he told the driver of his own car.\n\"Hurry,\" was all Julee said. Then, distantly, Jim heard the door grate open and a man's voice order her out of the car.\nJim could see the bridge ahead of them, and the blasted landscape of East Louis on the far side. During the war, a targeting mistake had flattened the ghetto of East Louis while leaving San Louis and her military airport virtually unscathed. The drumming of a helo's blades reached Jim above the thunder of the racing hovercar, and he hoped it was theirs.\nThey arrived in an inevitable cloud of dust and ashes kicked up from beneath the hovercar's skirt, diving out of the car as bullets shattered the windshield and tore holes in the upholstery. It wasn't armored, Jim reminded himself as he tried to pierce the swirling dust. The car began to settle with a whine, and the dust settled with it, as the two men with Jim returned fire.\nNed had taken cover behind the armored escort and was keeping them pinned with devastating accuracy. The shell of a building rose behind him, covering his back. Jim had doubts about how long their own car could continue to shield them as the withering fire slowly shredded it. Ned would have to run out of ammunition before they could do much to him. They weren't about to hit him... he was using the door of the cockpit as a shield and firing through the hinge slit.\nJulee Aston was nowhere to be seen. Jim peered around the edge of the open door behind which he crouched, then jerked back as bullets whizzed past his ears, painfully loud.\nA new rattle of gunfire, deeper than the tinny sounds of hand weapons, joined the cacophony. The helo was descending, and Jim could see the fire that spit from her guns. The heavy slugs hammered the side of the armored car, rocking it. Ned turned to face this new threat and raised his weapon.\nJim didn't think he'd ever get a better opportunity. The rough ground gave him excellent traction as he bounded across the space that separated the two vehicles and up onto the body of the armored car. The strength and speed that made his ancestors one of the most feared predators in Asia made Jim a dark blur as he leapt from the roof of the car and crashed into Ned Chang. He took him from the side, throwing his greater weight into a twist that brought Ned down beneath him. His claws sank into the man's back and the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth as he clamped powerful jaws around his neck and squeezed.\nA flicker of motion at the corner of his eye brought his head around with a snap. Julee Aston stared at him in a mixture of shock and horror from beneath the car where she had taken refuge when the firefight began. Her eyes were huge against the pale skin of her face. It was the child's face, exactly as he had seen it twenty years before.\nThey remained that way for several moments, staring into each others' eyes. The understanding that passed between them ran too deep for words. Then Julee broke the contact and looked around.\n\"Is it safe to come out?\" She asked. The gunfire had stilled, and only the sound of the hovering helo filled the air.\nJim nodded. Uncertain, he offered her his hand despite the blood that covered it. After a moment, she took it, and let him pull her out from underneath the car.\nFour days later, Jim found himself once more sitting across from Julee Aston in the familiar environs of her study. A man occupied a third chair. He was, Jim had to admit, one of the most handsome men he had ever seen, with the perfect features of a Greek god. His hair fell in waves of burnt gold to his shoulders, and he had the lean, muscular build of a swimmer, easily visible through the loose, sleeveless shirt that he wore. Like the rest of his clothing, the shirt was carefully tailored, and expensive. Everything about him spoke of money and of quality. The only unusual thing about him were the thick folds of brightly colored skin that fell the length of his body from his shoulders and arms. When he raised his arms, they expanded into a beautiful mosaic of butterfly markings, like a spread cape, that stretched from ankles to wrists. And yes, he had answered Jim's question, he could glide formidable distances, provided the winds weren't too rough.\nHis name was Parker Eddings. And he was now a member of the Council, occupying the newly created Altered seat. Julee's motion had passed by a narrow margin the day before.\nJim was thoroughly curious why she had asked him here.\nAfter the introductions were made, Julee turned to him. \"Councillor Eddings asked me to arrange this meeting, so I will leave it to him to say whatever he has planned.\"\nEddings smiled at the light jab. Then he turned to Jim. \"I understand that your employment with Councillor Aston will soon be ending.\"\nJim nodded, \"Yes.\" Out of the corner of his eye he watched Julee for a reaction, but was disappointed. She had not said anything when he had told her the first time, either.\n\"Then I would like to offer you a position on my own staff.\" He held up a hand. \"And not just as a bodyguard. You know what it is to be Altered without the advantages I have always enjoyed. I need someone with that perspective if I'm going to do anything truly useful for our people.\"\nHe was an incredible orator, this new Councillor, Jim thought. For a moment he was tempted, drawn by the power of the man's personality. Then he shook his head.\n\"I can't, Councillor.\"\nEddings watched him for several moments, as if debating whether or not to try to convince him. Eventually he smiled, resigned.\n\"I was afraid that might be your answer. I hope you'll reconsider.\" He laid a small card on the desk near Jim. \"That has my private number, in case you do.\"\nJim picked up the card, nodded.\nAfter a few minutes of idle talk with Julee, Councillor Eddings took his leave. To Jim's surprise, he offered him a hand as he was leaving, and Jim could tell that he had not thought twice about the gesture. It was the first time in Jim's memory. He glanced at the man's card again after the door had closed and wondered if he might not take his offer after all.\nThe stillness in the room brought Jim out of his thoughts. Julee Aston sat behind her desk, chin cupped in her hands, staring at him. It was not a hostile gaze, but Jim could not decipher it beyond that. Surprised to find his heart beating fast, Jim waited for her to break the silence. When she did, it was not with anything he had hoped she'd say.\n\"I am formally releasing you from your oath, Jim Leary, as of this time. Your employment by the Aston Estate is thereby terminated, without prejudice.\" The words were formal, as they were required to be, in order to be binding under law.\nJim nodded and said nothing. He didn't know what he could say, or even if he wanted to say anything.\nJulee leaned back in her chair. \"So this is goodbye?\" There was a note of sadness in her voice.\n\"I guess it is, Councillor.\"\nA ghost of a smile illuminated her features. \"Well, it's been an adventure, to use an old cliche.\"\nJim found himself smiling as well. Then he sobered. \"Take care, Councillor.\" Tucking Eddings card away in his waist pouch, he jumped to the floor and walked toward the door.\n\"Leary, wait.\" Julee's voice stopped him before he had taken three steps. He paused and turned.\n\"This is for you.\" She came around the desk and handed him a small cream colored envelope. He accepted it curiously.\n\"Open it later,\" she added when he turned it over to examine the seal.\n\"All right,\" he shrugged, and added it to the contents of his pouch. Then, without further ado, he turned and padded quietly from the room. Julee watched him go, face expressionless.\nWhen he opened the cream colored envelope, Jim found inside a reservation ticket for two for dinner at the Tea Room. It was dated nearly a year in the future, on the first anniversary of the creation of a Council seat for Altereds. Jim grinned to himself and wondered if either of them would show.\nValerie Jones is an engineer, although not currently working in her field, which is the aerospace industry.

Drew\nCopyright (c) 1989\nI watched in horror as the enormous toaster oven opened its door and began to speak. What came out was the worst imitation of Edward G. Robinson's voice that I have ever heard. ``We're moving in, ya hear?'' it said. ``And there's nothin' you can do ta stop us, myah, nothin'. So give up that transistor radio. Myah. It's the only thing standing between us and total world domination. Myah, myah.''\nThe man standing in front of it, looking all the smaller because of the oven's immense size, clutched the transistor radio to his chest.\n``Never!'' he said.\n``Then prepare to die, fool Earthling! Myah.'' Then the toaster oven leapt into the air and came down flat on the man, crushing both him and the radio into oblivion. Oh, it was horrible. ``They Unplugged Chicago''-- giant appliances from space take over the Mafia. Definitely the worst film this side of ``Plan 9 from Outer Space.'' I was only too glad to turn off the television.\n``Thank God nothing like that could happen in real life,'' I said.\nMe and my big mouth.\nMy name is Marc Lynx. I am a detective, or at least that is what my business card says. But I never seem to get those run-of-the-mill missing person and murder cases. No, the cases I deal with are the sort you never read about in the papers-- except for the tabloids. Elvis-stealing aliens, Hitler's clone, teddy bears possessed by demons, you know the sort. I looked at my watch. It was just past noon, and I had a luncheon appointment at 12:30 down at the Five Happiness; a Chinese restaurant owned by my receptionist Nicholas' Jewish uncle Mordechai Zaronstein. Something about his daughter being missing. A simple missing person case would be a relief. Given my recent earnings, any case would be a relief. Normally, I refuse to take cases involving friends and employees on ethical grounds. Doing so had cost me a girl-friend back when I lived in Frisco. This time, though, my wallet decided to make an exception.\nWith my car in the shop (damn Yuppies and their Volvos!), I would have to resort to other transportation. A cab was out-- too expensive. I decided to take the bus. Naturally, it pulled away from the curb just as I reached the bus stop. I briefly considered taking the subway, but ruled that out quickly. The last time I had gone anywhere by subway, it had broken down between stations; leaving me stranded for several hours with the operator, a pair of winos, a transvestite, and a nun with her entourage of seven parochial school girls. A nightmare in real life.\nSo I decided to walk. It was only a couple of miles. Of course, I would have to fight my way through the noon press of humanity, but I could make it. I naturally exude an air of confidence that makes people tend to give me breathing space-- or is it an air of insanity? Is there a difference? In addition, if things really got tight, I could always pull out my .38 Magnum, yell ``Stop, thief!'' and watch the crowd part like the Red Sea.\nI made good headway at first, but the city slowly began to take its toll on me. The people seemed pushier than usual. The car horns seemed louder, and all directed at me. I grew tense. My eyes began to dart around, seeing monsters in every face. The fact that most New Yorkers are monsters anyway did not help matters any. Panic grew.\nI soon realized what was happening. Withdrawal symptoms. I admit it-- I am addicted. To Twinkies. ``My name is Marc, and I'm a Twinkiholic,'' or something like that. That luscious sponge cake, that heavenly cream filling, all those preservatives. Just thinking about it made the cravings worse. Luckily, I always carry a spare package in my jacket pocket. Panting a little, I stepped out of the traffic flow and reached into my pocket for it.\nMy pocket was empty! I checked again. Still empty. Panic began to take hold. Maybe the other pocket? I reached in, felt something, and pulled it out. Damn! It was the business card from Mordechai's restaurant.\nWhat was I going to do? The realization set in that I would be a gibbering wreck long before I got to the restaurant if I did not get some Twinkies immediately. My pace quickened. I was jogging now, pushing people out of my way heedlessly. As the tension grew, I started to run. People were staring, but I hardly noticed. One woman who I pushed wrapped herself up in her poodle's leash and fell over, yanking the dog from its feet. Under different circumstances, I might have been happy, since I hate poodles. Now, however, I could care less. I vaulted over a baby carriage like O.J. Simpson does over luggage, reached the corner, and screeched to a halt. There it was! Less than a block away, secluded in the midst of its parking lot, was a 7-11. The ubiquitous convenience store, well stocked with everything from bug killer to beer. And Twinkies. The store almost seemed to glow as I approached. I crossed the street in a daze, ignoring the fact that the light was against me. Cars slammed on their brakes, with more than one driver yelling obscenities out his window at me. But I did not care. At that moment, all that mattered was Twinkies. As soon as I saw them, nestled in their plastic wrappers beside the fruit pies and below the cupcakes, my breathing calmed. I was tranquil. The Twinkie-- my own private Holy Grail, from which I might sip and be reborn. I took two packages, caressing them lightly. So round, so soft, so fully packed with creme filling. Silently, treasuring the experience, I got into line to pay for them. I did my best to ignore the woman in line behind me. Once she saw what I was carrying, however, it was too late.\n``Twinkies!'' she said, snootily. ``Those things are just chock full of preservatives, you know. They'll kill you.'' Busybodies really get on my nerves.\n``Now this, this is real food,'' she said, pushing a can of vegetables in my face. ``Uncle Orville's Canned Okra. Nutritious, and without any preservatives.'' She sounded very smug.\nI noticed she said nothing about the taste. ``You really should eat more vegetables.'' ``Mind your own business, lady,'' I said, more than a bit irritated.\n``Well!'' she said, in falsified outrage. ``How rude! Wait until I tell Sally about this! I was only offering some advice, advice you should heed, young man. Just how old do you expect to live to be, eating nothing but preservatives?'' ``Until I'm a hundred and fourteen,'' I sneered. ``I intend to be well preserved.''\nI then turned around, ignoring all further comments from ``Okra Winfrey.'' I noticed the headline on one of the tabloids: ``Space aliens save Dan Quayle's life.'' What with how my cases go, I have met a few aliens, and none of them would have been that stupid. Or at least they would not have admitted to it. Now, the ones who stole Elvis, well, they knew what they were doing.\n``Next,'' said the clerk, interrupting my memories. ``That's you, man.''\nHe looked to be about nineteen, had pimples, and sported a thin moustache which looked like about two days growth, but which he had probably not shaved for two months. The ubiquitous convenience store clerk to go with the ubiquitous convenience store. I set the Twinkies down on the counter, reached in my pants pocket, and pulled out some coins, enough for the Twinkies and some thirty cents more. The clerk handed me my change: one thin dime.\nBefore I could comment on his lack of math skills, the entire building began to shake. The dime flew from my hand to land near the door, where it spun around in a drunken dance. Cans of beer fell out of the coolers, and candy bars leapt from the shelves in a mad dash for freedom. ``My God!'' screamed a woman-- I suppose it was ``Okra Winfrey.'' Too many vegetables make you jumpy. ``It's an earthquake!''\nI rather doubted that it was an earthquake. New York is built on fairly stable ground that does not shift much. Not like California. The quakes that I had experienced in San Francisco were one of the main reasons I had moved to New York. That and being run out of town on a rail.\nI jumped after my change, but a further shake put me off balance, and I nearly overshot the coin and headed for a video game. However, a twist and a grab at a counter let me stop quickly. Looking for the dime, I discovered I was standing on it. I also found that an older man wearing suspenders and a bow tie was pointing out the plate glass doors at the front of the store.\n``It's not an earthquake!'' he said. ``New York is sinking!''\nDoomsayers have been predicting for years that New York will sink into the Atlantic, and it is therefore one of the chief fears of New Yorkers, along with the thought of another garbage strike, or that the Statue of Liberty might actually belong to New Jersey. I glanced over my shoulder, and, sure enough, it looked like the man was right. The buildings across the street had become noticeably shorter. The street had already disappeared. For that matter, so had the store's parking lot. I was suspicious. Why should this store be left alone while the rest of the city sank out of sight? More likely, something was happening to this building independently of the others. But I would never find out about it by cowering in the back of the store with the other customers and the clerk. A case to solve, such as it was. I took a step toward the doors so as to see what had happened to the ground.\nI planted my foot firmly on the floor, and the linoleum jumped away. I suddenly found myself falling as the store was turned on end. Luckily for me, if not for the Twinkies I was carrying, I only fell a few feet, whereupon I landed on the now horizontal side of a counter. Most of the other people in the store were not so lucky, ending up as they did in a heap, covered by magazines and video rental boxes. One kid, however, slid into the candy aisle, where he was probably in Heaven. I simply held onto the counter for dear life as the entire building began to shake up and down. Then it started to rattle back and forth, which sent several liter bottles of pop and boxes of cereal flying around in a vicious rain which I, being near the front of the store, or the top, as it was at the moment, avoided. Although I should have expected it, I was still caught unprepared as the building proceeded to roll over. They say that when you are about to die, your entire life flashes in front of your eyes. If that is true, then I was in no danger. The only thing that flashed in front of my eyes was a vision of Sister Mary Margaret standing over me with a ruler in hand. Believe me, there has been much more to my life than Catholic school. Whatever is true, as I fell toward the plate glass windows at the front (now the bottom) of the store, seeing the all too obviously hard asphalt beyond, I though I was going to die.\nHowever, I did not die. When the building rolled over, the doors had flung open, and I proceeded to plunge right through them, along with a shower of ice cream bars, styrofoam cups, and two quarts of motor oil. Unlike the ice cream, cups, and oil, I managed to grab onto one of the door handles as I fell. I nearly wrenched my arm out of its socket in stopping myself, but stop I did. I considered myself rather fortunate. I had all of about three seconds to consider myself fortunate before a rack of Cheese Puffs slammed into me and tore the handle from my grasp. Time seemed to slow as the Cheese Puffs and I tumbled to the ground below. Asphalt spun by, closely followed by the convenience store, blue sky, and something huge and red. Then more asphalt, with ever growing yellow lines on it. More store, more sky, more red thing. A whole lot of asphalt, seemingly close enough to touch. Store. Sky. Red which totally filled my vison as I hit the ground.\nLuckily, the Cheese Puffs had been underneath me as hit, so I was more or less undamaged. I sprang to my feet, stumbled for a second, and regained my balance. Amazingly, I was still holding on to the Twinkies, although they were rather compressed by now. ``SPAM?'' boomed a voice from overhead. I looked up to see what could possibly have such a large voice. Silly me, I had forgotten that I was still under the open doors, and the rack of Cheese Puffs turned out not to be the last thing to fall out. I looked up just in time to see something blue and silver strike me on the forehead. I think that I would have lost consciousness, but the booming voice spoke again, replacing the blackness with redness, centered somewhere between my ears.\n``SPAM!''\nI stumbled back a step, and looked down. Indeed, I had been hit by a falling can of Spam. It sat a few feet away, doing its best to look innocent. Now, looking innocent is one of the few things that Spam can do well, and this can was expert. Of course, its effort was aided by the fact that a few feet farther away sat a pair of twelve-foot long Reebok tennis shoes. Worse yet, there were legs of the same scale in the Reeboks. As I followed the legs up, noting the red and white striped socks covering them, they merged into a round, red armored body, which continued up. And up, and up some more. A pair of ridiculously thin arms eventually joined the body, and it was all topped off by a domed head sporting bulging eyes of a sort rarely seen anywhere outside of a Tex Avery cartoon. The eighty-foot tall fire hydrant looked down at me and the Spam with malice in its eyes. Effortlessly, it shifted the weight of the convenience store which rested on its shoulder, tipping it back so that nothing more fell out. I finally realized just why stores claim that their largest losses come from shoplifting. With as smooth a motion as I could manage, I bent down, scooped up the can of Spam, turned on my heel, and ran. Ben Johnson never ran faster, with or without steroids. There was a crash, as if a convenience store had just fallen sixty-odd feet to the ground.\n``SPAM!'' boomed the fire hydrant. ``COME BACK, SPAM!'' Not a chance. I raced down the street. People jumped out of my way, and again out of the fire hydrant's. Those who did not move, I pushed. Those too heavy to push got dodged. Some of them probably got stepped on by the hydrant as it TROMP! TROMP! TROMP!ed after me.\nI ran into the street without looking. Stopping for the ``Don't Walk'' sign is all well and good, at the right time and place, but it is not something you do when you are about to become gum on the sole of a twelve-foot long tennis shoe. A car slammed on its brakes, screeching to a halt, but it was too late. I ran into its fender and my momentum carried me over the hood of the car in a tumble. I managed to land on my feet and kept on running without missing a beat. From behind, I heard the CRUNCH! as the car became to the fire hydrant what an empty pop can would be to me if I stepped on it-- an annoyance wrapped around the foot which needs to be kicked off. I think that the remains landed about a block away.\nAs my foot hit the curb, I reached out and grabbed the lightpost on the corner and let my momentum carry me around in a quarter circle so that I was now running down the cross street. Hopefully, this way I would lose the fire hydrant, or at least gain some time.\nNo such luck. With something as large as that, my little jog did nothing but make it have to change direction slightly. It cut diagonally across the street, crushing anything that got in its way. If I had accomplished anything, it was only to let the fire hydrant gain on me.\n``SPAM!''\nIt was right behind me. I imagined that I could feel the air rushing to get out of the way of those huge feet as they came closer and closer to grinding me into thick paste. What was I going to do?\nLuckily, by this time, most of the people had cleared the street and sidewalk before me. It was a good thing, since the sprinting was beginning to take its toll on me. I was no longer alert enough to watch out for little children and stoplights. I certainly was not alert enough to watch out for homeless people lying on the sidewalk.\nI was halfway to the ground before I realized that I had tripped over the transient's legs, and I was all the way to the ground before I could think of anything to do about it. By then it was too late-- my stride was broken, my lead was gone. I picked myself up and was sure that I felt the rushing air from the hydrant's descending shoe. A big black shadow obliterated the sky, growing larger as the huge shoe tried to make me one with the concrete. That was when I saw it. My salvation, or so I hoped.\nThere was an alley only a few feet away. With speed lent by need, I lunged out from under the shoe and dove into the alley. I made it, but I fear that the transient was not quite so lucky. The alley was narrow, and thankfully not a dead end, so I would be able to escape. At the entrance, the fire hydrant cocked its head to one side and then the other in puzzlement, peering in at me. Of course, since its head was attached without a neck, it had to literally move its entire body in order to cock its head, which made it appear to be doing a funny dance in front of the alley.\n``SPAM?''\nIt did not take long, though, for the hydrant to deduce that I had, indeed, fled into the alley. Maybe it could smell me. However it had found me, it must have decided that there was no fundamental difference between the two of us, and it tried to follow me into the alley. Of course, there was a fundamental difference-- I was shorter, and rather a bit thinner. But it did not let the size differential dissuade it as it rammed its body straight into the alley.\nAt first I was worried that I had misjudged the width of the alley, and that it would be able to pass unimpeded. However, after a few feet, the fire hydrant slowed as the stubs from which its arms emerged ground up tight against the side of the alley. Although it twisted and tried to turn, it looked as though the hydrant were securely stuck.\nI should have known that it could not be that easy. With a roar of rage, or perhaps it was pain, the fire hydrant surged forward again. Its stubby shoulders dug a pair of two foot deep furrows in the sides of the buildings, and bright sparks shot off in every direction. It was still coming after me, even if it had been slowed to a crawl. Maybe, just maybe, I would be able toescape it, but only if the alley was long enough to give me a good lead.\n``SPAM!'' it boomed, but with a grunt of effort underlying the word.\nAs my luck would have it, the alley was quite short. I jogged along it and reached the next street a couple minutes before the fire hydrant would be able to, but I wished that it could have been longer. From my general surroundings, I decided that I must be on Wall Street. Yuppies scuttled hither and yon, running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. If I had had no idea as to the cause of the panic, I would have assumed that the market was crashing again. Within moments, the entire street was deserted except for me.\nAs I walked alone down Wall Street, hearing the faint rumblings of the hydrant as it scraped its way through the alley, I considered my options. I could keep running and hope that the police would take care of the hydrant, but I quickly abandoned that possibility. It is not that I believe that the N.Y.P.D. is inefficient, but I doubt that they could really handle something of this scope. Perhaps the National Guard, or the Army? I considered the metal casing of the hydrant, and put that hope out of my mind as well. If the Japanese army could do nothing against the flesh of Godzilla, could the American army do any better against a metal monster? I doubt it! Of course, I could always give up and let the fire hydrant have the can of Spam. That would certainly solve all of my immediate problems, but I worried about the future. Why did the hydrant want Spam? Why would anyone? And why this particular can? It could always go and hold up another store (so to speak), right? I had a feeling that there was more to the Spam concern than met the eye.\nA dark cloud drifted in from somewhere over the harbor to try and obscure the sun. The light breeze that had been playing with my hair turned vicious and tried to bite at me through my jacket. A neon sign in a deserted brokerage house window proclaimed the latest interest rates on long term, high yield C.D.'s, and the glow of its light was reflected in the windows of a solitary parked car. I suddenly came to realize that I was still carrying both the Spam and my Twinkies, which were now nothing but paste from the abuse I had put them through. Only a little dismayed, I put the Spam in my jacket pocket and opened up the Twinkies, squeezing a little out on my hand and eating it like the cheap caviar paste that comes in a tube. Believe me, though, Twinkie paste tastes a lot better than cheap caviar paste. In addition, it helped to replace some of the energy I had expended in my headlong flight from the hydrant, as well as quelling the withdrawal pangs that were coming back as my adrenaline level returned to normal.\n``SPAM!''\nThe fire hydrant emerged from the alley in a shower of debris. As it oriented itself on me, I took off running again. In seconds, it was after me, the TROMP! TROMP! TROMP! of its feet growing ever louder, ever closer. I was almost to the Stock Exchange. A minute longer and I could duck inside and...and...and then what? I had no idea. I was quickly relieved of all concern over the ``what next'' question.\n``SPAM! STOP! PREPARE TO DIE!'' A coherent sentence, more or less. This in itself might have been enough to give me pause, but the booming voice exerted command. I stopped.\nA loud whine began to build behind me. It sounded like some horrible weapon building its energy, preparing to release it and destory me. What would it be? A phaser? A wave-motion gun? The latest Jackie Collins paperback? Each possibility seemed worse than the one before.\nIt began to grow dark. With nightfall still hours away, I was sure that I knew what was happening. The fire hydrant had some powerful energy weapon trained on me, one that required so much power that it was literally sucking the light right out of the air around me. The whine continued to increase in volume. My right arm began to twitch uncontrollably. ``What am I?'' I thought. ``A man or a mouse?'' Cliche, I know, but at that moment I was hardly trying to come up with an original line.\nA man, I decided. I had come to the conclusion that I was not going to get out of this one alive. I was going to be blown to bits by whatever weapon the hydrant had, and most of Manhattan would probably go with me. At least the hydrant would not get this can of Spam. Sure, it seems silly to lose your life and most of a major city over a can of processed pseudo-meat, but principles have to start somewhere, and mine started right there. I was going to die, but I was going to go down fighting. With this decision, all trembling in my arm stopped. I reached into my jacket and pulled my .38 Magnum from its holster. Certainly, a simple lead bullet would do no good against something as large as that thing, but at least I would be able to go out in a blaze of glory. As I brought it out, one corner of my mind noticed that there was something...different...about my gun. The texture, the color, the balance-- all were off. However, I had no time to dwell on this as I turned, spinning myself around to defiantly face the fire hydrant. Everything seemed to move in slow motion. My arms did an odd, bobbing dance as I spun, but oriented unerringly on the hydrant. As soon as it came into my sights, my fingers tensed, contracting about where the trigger should have been, as I fired off a single shot. Indeed, a trigger would have been there, had it been my .38 Magnum that I was holding. How a banana had got into my holster, I have no idea. As my hands jerked up, reflexively imitating the kickback of a gun, my mind drifted into an odd thought: at least the banana in my holster explained why my Rice Krispies had been so gritty at breakfast. As my hands flew up and I arrested my spin, realizing that the shot from my banana had not happened, I saw that the hydrant was holding nothing that resembled what I would call a weapon. Instead, it was looking up at the ever darkening sky. The whine kept getting louder.\nI looked up, too. The little cloud I had noticed earlier had grown to cover the sky from horizon to horizon, which, admittedly, is not very far in midtown Manhattan. It was pitch black and swirling in a funnel shape, being occasionally lit by flashes of green and purple. I could not help but wonder if the Ghostbusters were back in town.\nA beam of light shot out of the vortex and hit the street between the hydrant and myself, but did no damage. ``Wonderful,'' I thought. ``The hydrant didn't have any weapons on it, so it decided to call its spaceship. Instead of just New York, it's probably going to blow up the entire state!'' A second beam also came out of the vortex, followed by a third, this one of a slightly different color. They started to move, slowly at first, and then picked up speed to where they were tracing an intricate pattern in the street. After a few seconds, someone turned on the volume. A series of five musical notes played, then repeated. Once, twice, three times. It was a familiar sequence of notes, one that I heard before, from an old song, maybe, or perhaps a late 70's science-fiction movie. The wind picked up again, blowing my hair around more violently, tearing at my clothing. Bits of trash and dead leaves tumbled through the dry gutters, playing tag with wisps of fog running away from the harbor. I put my hand up to shield my eyes from the ever brightening display of dancing lights and flickering lightning. With one corner of my mind, I noticed that the fire hydrant had done the same.\nSomething began to come down out of the cloud vortex. Actually, it was four somethings, each of them about ten feet across. They were coming down right where I was standing, so I moved. My mind was on the things dropping out of the sky, and I walked toward the fire hydrant without thinking. Luckily, it seemed much more concerned with the things than with me. ``GO AWAY! MY SPAM!'' it boomed.\nThe four things took no notice, and continued to come down. They were an odd, silvery metallic color, and roughly cylindirical in shape. They looked rather like legs, with off-center landing pads at the ends. Sure enough, another, larger object came out of the vortex, and the four cylinders were revealed to be legs for whatever it was. ``Landing gear for a spaceship,'' I thought. ``And the ship evidently doesn't belong to the fire hydrant.'' Now, before this encounter, I had had a fairly clear idea of what a spaceship should look like. It had to have a circular, saucer shape to it, whether that was the whole ship, like in ``The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' or just part of the whole, like in ``Star Trek.'' This thing had no disc-like qualities to it. It was nearly two hundred feet long, and about as tall as the fire hydrant. The four legs attached to the body in an oddly jointed way, which made them look as if they could bend in all directions. At one end of the body was a curved appendage which was waving back and forth. At the other end was an odd protuberance, with a pair of pyramidal mounds sticking out of it, a pair of glassed in viewports, and a mouth with sharp teeth in it. I had seen a few of these before, owning one myself, but they were never like this. Earthly German Shepherds are rarely silver and they never grow quite so large. As I stood there, I knew exactly how a mouse must feel when cornered by a cat. There I was, standing between a giant fire hydrant out to squish me flat, and a giant German Shepherd-shaped spaceship, which had unknown intentions. It was, however, looking at me. And it was growling.\nI was trying to decide which way I should run when a small black hole appeared in the side of the German Shepherd, about where its ribs should have ended. The hole grew larger, and then a ramp of the same silvery material as the ship began to form out of the air. It formed a spiral joining the hole to the street just a few feet in front of me. Then a figure stepped into view at the top of the ramp.\nAt first, the figure looked pitch black, blacker than the hole itself. Soon, though, it stepped out into the light and was revealed in all its glory. It was pink and round, and it looked to be about four feet tall. Hardly the most frightening thing. It took a single step forward, and then the ramp acted as an escalator, transporting the alien down to street level. Before this, I had only met two different types of aliens. One set were the tall, thin, white aliens with big black eyes that half the population of the world seems to have met. They are peaceful and benevolent, and claim to be tending Earth protectively for the day we finally become truly civilized. It is to this end that they kidnapped Elvis, because they see him as the savior of the human race, the man who will ultmately lead us to civilization. I think that they are more than a little crazy. The other aliens I have encountered were a pair of ugly reptilian creatures who claimed to be advance scouts for some invasion, but who turned out to be nothing more than lost vacationers. Neither encounter had really prepared me to meet this pink thing. The little creature was indeed only about four feet tall, pink, and round. It was fuzzy, too, like a peach, or that mold that grows on sour cream that sits in the refrigerator for too long. It had a pair of fuzzy pink stalks growing out of its top, each of which sported two eyes. They blinked at me in unison. Three arms were attached equidistantly around its middle, and a pair of legs came out from somewhere underneath. On its feet it wore a pair of fancy black and silver spats. The looked really snazzy-- just the thing that every well dressed fuzzy pink alien should be wearing. On its front, or at least the side that was facing me, was a little blue and white patch. It read: ``Hello. My name is Sfherg.''\nI pointed my .38 Magnum banana at Sfherg. Hopefully it would think that I held a viable weapon, not just a piece of slightly overripe fruit.\n``Don't move!'' I said. ``I've got you covered!'' Sfherg brought its rear arms up over its head just like crooks do in all the old movies and television shows, and I thought that I had it beat. Then it raised the forward one and pointed the small lavender banana it held straight at my chest. Great, just what I needed. An alien race for which bananas really were weapons.\n``Ekjm\\ lu9u3'm mk $ki04,'' it said, or something equally unitelligible. From where the sounds came, I have no idea. Shferg did not seem to have a mouth.\nSfherg's third hand contracted slightly, and a laser beam shot out of its banana and struck the back of my hand. It did no damage, but, damn!, it was hot, and I dropped my .38 Magnum banana because of it. I shook my hand in the air for a few seconds, and then sucked on the red spot where the beam had hit. That seemed to help some.\nThe fire hydrant decided that this was its cue to act again. The only problem is, it was not a very good actor. Good vocal projection, that it had, but nothing whatsoever in the way of body language.\n``GO AWAY! MY SPAM!'' it boomed.\nFor the first time, Sfherg seemed to take notice of the hydrant. It swiveled both eyestalks without turning its body and looked at the German Shepherd-shaped spaceship, which was still staring at me with tightly curled lips. ``Uunk4EGj89 jl89';quj9!'' Sfherg jabbered at it, pointing toward the hydrant.\nThe spaceship's head swiveled away from me and toward the fire hydrant. With a low growl in its throat, it barked at the hydrant, a loud bark which shattered a few nearby windows. The hydrant did not seem affected in the least, and started forward. ``MY SPAM! GO A---'' Its booming voice was suddenly cut off as the spaceship lifted one of its rear legs, revealing a sort of gun turret. A bright yellow laser beam shot out, stunning the hydrant into quiescence. Evidently satisfied that the fire hydrant was no longer trying to horn in on its territory, Sfherg's eyestalks reoriented on me and it returned to jabbering.\n``U7ma] cy9ko2' =vRUhik 4k-*YU$ MkPV+w!'' it said. I had no idea what it was trying to say, but I had the odd feeling that it was trying to sell me something. Insurance, maybe, or disposable diapers.\n``I don't know what you're selling,'' I said, ``but I ain't buying!'' I showed it my empty hands and shook my head in an exaggerated fashion.\nSfherg continued to jabber at me, throwing its arms about like an Italian juggler on drugs. I was quite aware that one of those hands still held the little heat-beam shooting banana. I took a step back. Sfherg took a step forward. I stepped back. It stepped forward.\nSoon enough, I ``cha-cha''ed my way onto one of the fire hydrant's feet. Not the place I wanted to be, trapped between a rock and a hard place, as it were. I felt the fire hydrant rumble softly. It was evidently coming out of its quiescent state. Great! Trapped between a live rock and a hard place! ``---WAY! GO AWAY!'' The fire hydrant suddenly came back to life, acting as though it had never been zapped. It continued to walk forward. Me, I had been sitting on one of its Reeboks, and suddenly found myself flying. I was launched into the air with the greatest of ease, that daring young me with no flying trapeze. I sailed over Sfherg's eyestalks and crashed into one of the legs of the spaceship. I slid to the ground, feeling very much like Wile E. Coyote.\nI stood up and shook my head. I think something rattled around in there. I leaned against the leg for a second, gathering my wits, noticing how soft the leg was, almost like real fur. Then I remembered Sfherg and the hydrant. Sfherg had obviosuly not expected me to go flying like that, and both of its eyestalks had moved to watch my flight. The hydrant was evidently curious as well, and had stopped in mid-step to see where I landed. Now that I was down, though, it continued to walk.\nThe hydrant paid about as much attention to where it was stepping as any normal human would with respect to the sidewalk. In other words, it was much more intent on catching me and the Spam than it was in watching out for small fuzzy aliens named Sfherg that might be standing in its path. Sfherg was not any better, its attention still being focused on me. As a result, no one but me saw the action as the hydrant stepped on Sfherg. I tried to yell, but it was already too late. Sfherg's body exploded in a puff of pink alien fuzz, much like the down that flies when a pillow is ripped open. As the fuzz slowly drifted toward the ground, I noticed that Sfherg's little lavender banana had flown away from the scene of the accident and had landed near my feet. Following my previous pattern for the day, I picked it up and put in in my pocket. ``GIVE SPAM!'' boomed the fire hydrant, oblivious to what it had just done.\n``Broken record,'' I thought.\nI looked up at the spaceship, which was eyeing me intently again. Maybe I looked like a chew toy to it. I pointed at the pile of fluff that had once been Sfherg. ``Well?'' I said. ``Aren't you going to do something? That fire hydrant just stepped on your master! Sic 'em, boy!'' The spaceship looked at the hydrant, growled, and leapt to the attack. If there had been a throat on the hydrant, the spaceship would have ripped it out. However, there was not, so it just tried to get a grip on one of the knobs on the side of the hydrant's head. The grip was not a very good one, given that teeth do not grasp rounded metal very well, and the spaceship began to slip off.\n``GO AWAY!''\nThe fire hydrant struck out with one arm and caught the spaceship in the midsection. With a yelp of pain, the spaceship let go and fell behind the hydrant. Assuming that the trouble was gone, the fire hydrant resumed its progress toward me. I knew by now that I would never be able to outdistance the hydrant again, and, besides, the spaceship was not yet out of the fight. Quietly, the spaceship had returned to it feet, and it leapt again, this time from behind. It latched onto one of the fire hydrant's arms, and refused to let go. The hydrant hit it on the head a couple of times, but this only drove the metal teeth deeper into its arm. Then the hydrant began to spin around. At first, the spaceship's mass kept the spin slow, but they soon built up speed, until the spaceship was lifted clear of the ground. The street was just wide enough for this stunt to be manageable. Faster and faster they spun, until they were little more than a red and silver blur. Then the hydrant lurched to the side a few feet. This had the effect of slamming the spaceship's aft section into a building the next time it came around. Although pieces of glass and brick flew from the collision, the building survived basically intact. The spaceship was not quite so lucky. Its rear legs and tail were completely sheared off, falling in a crumpled heap on the sidewalk and the solitary remaining parked car. Other bits and pieces of the midsection were scattered all over the area, and probably for several blocks in every direction. I sidestepped one of the front paws, but several smaller chunks hit me. I protected my face with my arms, however, and so managed to escape with just a few cuts and bruises.\nHalf destroyed as it was, the spaceship's jaws relaxed and opened, and its remains fell of the hydrant's arm, crushing what remained of the car below. The hydrant itself still seemed dizzy from its spin, and lurched drunkenly from side to side. However, it had little problem finding me again, although I suspect it saw three or four of me, not just one.\nWeaving slightly, the hydrant took a step toward me, and then another. Then it seemed to lose its footing, but caught itself against the damaged building to its side, leaving a fire hydrant-shaped imprint in the bricks. Quite the first impression. It righted itself, took another step with the same foot, and slipped again. It twisted halfway around and got its legs all tangled up. Then it started to fall over. Its arms flailing wildly, trying to stop its fall, it tipped over, slowly at first, then faster.\n``SPAAAAAAAAAAM!''\nIt was then that I realized that it was falling straight toward me. For the past several seconds, I had been so intently watching Sfherg and the fight between the fire hydrant and the spaceship that I had given little thought to running away. Now, however, I did run. As I ran down the street, the thought briefly crossed my mind that I should just run to one side or the other, and the hydrant would thereby miss me. My legs, however, refused to act on that thought. All they had to do was get some fifty feet down the street, and they would avoid getting crushed by falling fire hydrants. After a short time, I was fairly sure that I had indeed made it into the safe zone, but I was not about to stop and check. If I did, I would be almost certain to find that I was just short, and would get pounded into the ground. It turned out, however, that I had reached safety, as I heard the crash as the hydrant hit behind me. I slowed down and started to turn around in order to see what the damage was when I was suddenly hit by a huge wall of water.\nIt did its best to force its way into my lungs, but I steadfastly refused to admit it. Failing to drown me, the wall of water decided it would just try to bash me senseless against the street. This it did a fair job of, tumbling me down the street, soundly knocking my head against the asphalt twice. Luckily, Wall Street has a sufficient number of storm drains, and the wall of water soon became little more than a picket fence, and then stopped carrying me altogether. I stood up, dripping wet. There is nothing I like less than to be sopping wet while fully clothed. No, I take that back-- it is much worse to be fully clothed and covered in warm taffy, but that is another story. I finished turning around, and began to walk back up the street so I could see what remained of the New York financial district. With each step, I left a sizeable puddle behind.\nUpon hitting the street, the stress had evidently been too much for the hydrant, and its top had shattered, releasing all of the water pent up inside. Even now, a small stream was still cascading out of the wreckage, with no sign of stopping soon. I felt it safe to assume that the hydrant was indeed quite dead. I walked around to its feet, just in time to see the twelve-foot long Reeboks vanish into thin air. The hydrant's huge feet, still clad in red and white striped socks, shriveled up and curled in on themselves, disappearing inside the hydrant's body. All that was left was a brown and yellow mass that had been stuck to the bottom of one of the shoes, the sole remains of my .38 Magnum banana.\nI surveyed the carnage. The remains of the German Shepherd-shaped spaceship, the last light just fading from it eyes, lay on the totaled car. A small pile of pink fuzz, all that was left of Sfherg, slowly drifted away on the autumn breeze. Sfherg's lavender banana sat in one of my pockets, and the can of Spam weighed down the other. I picked up what was left of my .38 Magnum banana to see if it was salvageable, but it was not, so I threw it onto the sidewalk. In the window of the damaged building, the neon sign flickered once, twice, and went dark. The cloud vortex overhead was starting to dissipate. In the silence that pervaded the scene, the fire hydrant seemed rather less frightening, with the thin stream of water still bubbling out of it and flowing into the New York sewer system. Well, at least the street was clean.\nIn the distance, I heard the police sirens start up as they were dispatched to the scene. They would clean up everything and repair all the damage. They would not want me around; this I had learned several times in the past. They would not even want a statement from me, preferring to keep the whole thing quiet. Nonetheless, I pulled one of my business cards from my wallet and stuck it on the still damp nose of the spaceship. No sense in making them wonder.\nThe whole thing would be hushed up, covered up, buried six feet under. In next to no time, no one would remember anything about it. Even ``Okra Winfrey'' would probably just pass it off as a stomach cramp or something. But I knew what had happened, and that was all that mattered.\nSo, with my underwear starting to hitch up as it dried, I started off toward the Five Happiness restaurant and my luncheon appointment, for which I was now quite overdue. Sidestepping a chunk of debris, I took out Sfherg's little heat beam-shooting banana and sighted along it, thinking that it really was a pity tabloids.\nJames Drew is... well, he just is.

The alchemy of sunrise and water turns the Hudson to gold, but the bridge is showing its years, rusty and snaggletoothed. A few suspension cables have rotted through, cut low to sway ominously in the wind, or high to hunch over and dangle trawling the shining river, gilt v-wakes marking empty steel-bristled hooks thirty feet under, hoping for a bite from... what? What would bite on such a lure? Perhaps the old mills of Albany, dead forty years before the last collapse, have moldered alive, metal husks slipping into the upper Hudson, revived and evolved by the cold rapids until a new sort of salmon runs again to the sea: Jacquard-loom gills, die-cast scales, firepump heart and bandsaw jaws. I'd like to meet one someday, we could swap notes... ah, hell, I'm an old man. Forgive my meanderings. Anyway the bridge looks sound enough, so I cross.\nSomeone has burned the tollbooths on the other side. Fried the fuckers in their own juices. Always wanted to try that. An incurable pyromaniac and I don't think I want to be cured, either. I pick my way through the blackened steel bones. I'm getting a bit tired, but persuade myself to scramble up one of the high granite hills on the far side. I stumble through groves of sumac, dogwood, patches of poison ivy, starting to wonder if I'll make it to the top. Falling asleep would be bad; I'm on the shady side of the mountain. Then all of a sudden a steep earth bank, a clump of pines, a glimpse of blue sky, and the summit. A patch of bare rocks. Beautiful. I stand on the highest rock and gaze out over New Jersey, the rising sun in my eyes.\nNew Jersey. Butt of a million asphalt jokes. New Jersey. \"What exit?\" New Jersey. \"Lay-deez an' gentlemen, Da Toxic Sludge State.\" New Jersey. \"Why do all the trees in New York bend south? 'Cause New Jersey sucks.\" New Jersey. \"Where even the skunks wear gas masks.\"\nBut, seeing it now, I can taste the old spirit of the land, long flat cattail marshes alive with turtles and blackbirds and muskrats, thick forests of tulip and maple swaying skeletal in the winter wind and bursting out green with the sweet spring breeze, these weary granite mountains, soft and round with age, waiting patiently to see the holocaust through. So it was not so long ago, and so it will be again. Soon.\nThe land is healing fast, now. Old smokestacks line the horizon, but more than a few are crumbling, broken in half or festooned with clinging ivy. I pull out binoculars and focus, morbidly, on the nearest factory. It looks like a refinery. Alive, it was a monstrosity, a belching metal beast settled like a queen ant to sprawl and spawn. Poison its food, poison its blood, poison its dung. But, dead, it has a certain grandeur to it. Difficult to explain; think perhaps of a young man, dissolute, cheeks reddened and belly padded with beer, wispy blond hair and a smug grin and the smell of cheap aftershave. Not a beautiful object, seen for what it is. Leave it out in the desert for a few months, and like grape juice it undergoes an miraculous transformation, becoming an intricate palace of ivory, a maze of clean spars and beams and smooth hollow places lying jumbled on the hot dry sand. These relics of Hoboken are the same.\nIt must be almost ten in the morning by now, and rationality reminds me I won't make much progress tonight unless I charge up. Normally I find a nice wide highway to bask on like a snake in the sun, but the bare mountaintop is good enough. I spread out the solar blanket, plug in, and drift away on a nice flat rock.\nLate in the afternoon I hit the highway again. Walking, of course. You can go a long way walking. Slap, thud, slap, thud, four miles an hour, forty miles a day and my those miles do add up. Beats those old diesel-hounds any day. You just can't appreciate a continent in a car; it's too small. The water turns you around every few days. You get frustrated and settle down in a concrete box and die. The Gypsies died out when they changed their Conestogas for Winnebagos. They thought they could master the machine, but the machine mastered them, and they ended up just another tribe of welfare Indians on the wrong side of the tracks. But me? I'll be walking around for quite a few years yet. Planning on seeing the Amazon and the Andes this winter; maybe Europe next summer.\nAs the sun is setting I spot a column of smoke a few hundred yards off the road. Worth investigating. A narrow overgrown path leads off the shoulder through the trees. I take it. A few minutes of mud and brambles and I come into a little dell in the bend of a stream. Tiny cottage on the hillside and an old woman working a sun-dappled cornfield hardly the size of a healthy rug. She sees me. Pauses a second in surprise, then yells with joy. \"Young man!\"\nI think of the Holy Roman Empire.\nShe runs over and hits me with a fierce hug. \"So they've done it then! Wonderful.\" Her face is a cracked dark-brown mudpie, her eyes are burnt charcoal, her body is short and squat, but she is beautiful. Hard not to be, these days. Society used to let its old dry into machines - tv-watching machines, gossip machines, bridge machines - but society is a thing of the past. To be old and survive today you have to be tough as nails and sweet as butter. She looks it. \"Come inside and have a beer.\"\nI decline the beer, obviously from a shrinking stash of ancient treasure, but we go inside and talk for a while. She wants to know where I'm from. My story: a research group at Yale kept on working for a while after the collapse and found the cure. Now they have a little village going and they're sending people out to see what's left. It's not a very good story but it's believable. Though hardly uplifting. The world repopulated by roving tribes of shiny-shoed silk-tied snotheaded Yalelies? I think I'll stick with the apocalypse, thank you.\nShe seems happy enough with it, though, and tells me her story. Born in '08, worked as a bank manager, married and widowed. When the bank closed she found a good patch of soil, bought some seed corn, and gave what was left of civilization its walking papers. Good instincts. We talk some more and she offers to let me spend the night. (On the couch, smartass.) I'd normally travel, but time is long and I don't see any reason not to accept.\nAfter she's asleep I stop pretending to be and explore the place. Finding: a small barn for a nonexistent goat. That cornfield, which doesn't look big enough to support a full-grown chicken let alone a person. A root cellar with a few forlorn cans of green beans heaped at the far end. A trash heap with the rusting shells of what looks like enough cans to have filled the cellar. I go back inside and watch her sleep. She's smiling faintly.\nShe's not going to make it through the winter. This is clear. And it won't be a pretty death, not at all. A person should die happy.\nThe flickering red glow casts long shadows on the brambles. The path is still muddy. The Indians had it right: destruction and resurrection are one and the same. Ash is the finest fertilizer around.\nIn the morning I have a less pleasant experience. Hiking down the Garden State, the sky grayish-blue but the trees still blocking the sun, I get ambushed. The hollow sthick-thwock of a pump shotgun being cocked:\n\"Freeze, motherfucker, put your hands on your head and turn around slowly.\"\nA crisp, spry old voice. Bet he heard that line on TV thirty years ago, been practicing it ever since. I turn around, and a man steps out of the woods. He's eighty-five if he's a day, but he's standing about twenty feet away with a big 12-gauge, and looks like he knows how to use it.\nAn uncertain pause, then... \"Ha! Mitsui eighty-four-C! Didn't know they had any of those left anymore. Look, pig, I know exactly what you're riding there and I know this gun will blow pieces of your nice little toy all over my fucking cornfield, so don't try anythng funny, right? Okay. So who are you? Who's riding that thing?\"\n\"Nobody. I'm autonomous.\"\nThe geezer's hands make pumping movements with the shotgun. \"What the fuck, pig, you think I'm stupid? Huh? You trying to fuck with my head? That's bullshit, I know it's bullshit and you know it's bullshit, and if you give me any more bullshit I'll blow your brains out through your back. You on extended recon? Got your recharge blanket?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Take it out - slowly - and toss it at my feet.\"\nI spin the small bundle as I throw it at him, hard. The air catches the crumpled sheet of silvery film and exploded it to float suspended between us for a moment, blocking his view. The sudden beat of my feet on the pavement, dart left spin and roll, a huge hollow boom, the impact of bodies, and he's on the ground and I have his gun. There's a fist-sized hole in my blanket but it'll still work. I point the gun at him.\n\"Shit,\" and he's crying, long racking sobs. \"Ah, shit. Christ, I'm sorry, I wouldn't have done it but the arthritis has been acting up something awful lately, my joints freeze up and I can't tend the corn, I don't know if I'll have enough to make it through the winter... but I used to be a cop, still have an old Mitsui controller in the garage, and when I saw you, well, it was like a fucking dream come true.\" He starts to cry again. \"Please don't hurt me, okay? I didn't mean no harm.\"\n\"Calm down, old man, why would I hurt you? Let's go sit down in the shade, I'll tell you a story.\" I keep the gun pointed at him as we walk, and make sure he sits down first.\nStatistics teaches us to see the work of prophets as mere chance. Failure was forgotten and success remembered, and so the diviners of old and the pundits of my day earned my keep. Yet it often seems, looking backward, as though they were even worse than that, as though a veil of confusion barred them from the obvious course of history. Prophets had been predicting the Apocalypse for millennia; it seems inconceivable that all of them could have missed the mark. But so it goes.\nWhen I was young, in the Eighties, we were told the world would end in atomic Armageddon; I practiced my own version of the old duck-and-cover, rolling and falling at the flash in my window to be safe under my bed before the blast wave hit. In the Nineties, it was environmental catastrophe; if we refused to mend our foolish ways, we would all boil, drown, freeze, or die of cancer, depending on the latest study. I spent an abominably tedious summer working in an inner-city recycling plant. The Zeros set us quivering in fear of deadly bioengineered plagues, escaped from some latter-day Strangelove's skunkworks lab or set loose by diabolical terrorists; we'd be merrily strolling down the street and suddenly everyone would burst out in buboes and cysts and cancers and die oozing loathsome fluids. I bought a designer gas mask, a garish Hawaiian style festooned with parrots and flowers and mutant fruit, and a little ring on the bottom to clip a tie on. Whether it would have actually done any good is unlikely; anyway the things went out of fashion in months. We trusted Fate and went on with our lives. The end of the world had gotten a bit old.\nWhen the apocalypse did finally come, there was nothing exciting about it. I got a bad cold. A lot of sneezing and sniffling for a couple days. Pretty much everyone came down with it. When we found out it was an engineered sterility virus, that everyone on the planet was permanently infertile... I don't know, it was so long ago and I don't really remember much from those days. Nobody went crazy, anyway. We assumed the scientists would cure it soon, and then we could all go on breeding, la di da.\nThe years went by and it didn't happen. After a while, people realized that it wasn't going to, that the technical problems were intractable within the lifetime of the current generation, but the truth's gradual advance gave the situation a relaxed normalcy. There was nothing violent about it; nobody was being killed in the streets, nobody was starving, even the criminals were getting old and settling down. The fade of civilization was an occasional human-interest story on TV.\nEventually the population grew too low to support a viable economy, and civilization more or less collapsed. But it was a soft collapse; no riots and barricades in the streets, just a load of old geezers dying as much from malaise as starvation. The tough ones moved to the countryside and stayed alive on small farms.\nI was running a private bioengineering research facility, up in Vermont, for Tony Petrovic. The man who'd made a billion in solar power and retired at forty to become a full-time professional nutcase. He had us working on a technique to transfer the human mind from the brain into a computer. Well, what can I say? It was bullshit. Utterly impossible. But God, Petrovic raved about it. You couldn't hold a conversation with the man without getting a spew about mechanical resurrection and psychic transfiguration of the soul and all that. He was paying good money, too. So I hired a few neuroengineers and computer types and we more or less just fooled around all-expenses-paid. No life for the ambitious, but it was fun enough.\nPetrovic died in '51. We kept working on the transfer project. Because he'd left a hefty endowment, because we'd made a few actual advances, but mostly from sheer inertia; there was nothing else worth doing. After things finally collapsed we turned our lawn into a cornfield and kept going; by this time we'd actually started to make real progress. In '70 we broke through. We had some old Mitsui remote-controlled androids, designed for undercover police work, refitted with the last generation of Neimann neuroprocessors, and a jury-rigged transfer scanner. We'd tested the latter on a dog, and it had seemed to work, but you can't tell much from a barking android and nobody was taking bets on it.\nBy then I was ninety and going senile. Did I want to be the first one through, or did the younger scientists just draft me as a guinea pig? Hard to say; maybe it was both. My memories of those days are cloudy. I remember the sharp stink of anesthetic putting my to sleep under the scanner, hoping to hell I wouldn't wake up there... and waking up in the android. Heaven. My mind had needed dry-cleaning for forty years, and when I came back, the must and the mothballs were washed away. A cold shower on the brain. I was alive.\nThe others wanted to try it. Naturally. We had enough equipment for everyone. But those people? Senility had left my personality more or less untouched under the dustbunnies, but, looking at my colleagues with new eyes... Tyler, who kept eighty-year-old kiddie porn mags in her desk? Berzinski, who walked imaginary dogs on real leashes? Stevens, who loved to reminisce about his glory days in the Great Chimpanzee-Fucking Project of '31 (tell him he's full of shit, and he'd just smile his soft dirty smile: \"Ah, don't you wish you could have been there, too?\")... these people wanted new lives? They were dead already, they just hadn't realized it yet. Even the ex-me never quite recovered after he'd lost the luck of the draw. He went all to moping self-pity. And he was a pretty worthless fuck, anyway; I should know.\nThe Mitsuis were the best androids ever designed. Battery-powered with solar recharge. Titanium skeleton and electromuscular power. No internal moving parts. The warranty expired a long time ago, but my new body should last a few hundred years if I'm careful. Time enough for anything.\nI burned the institute behind me. Some of the others might have been caught in the fire, I don't know. It didn't seem to matter much at that point. Now? Now I'm just kicking around, passing time, checking out the world. I thought it'd be fun to see the East Coast the way I always wanted it to be, and I was right.\nI shut up and look the old guy in the eye. He seems a little nervous. And who can blame him? I think he's sensed that I've said more than a stranger who expects to part a stranger usually does.\n\"You're gonna kill me, aren't you?\"\n\"Well, I hadn't really thought much about it, but, yeah, I suppose I will.\"\n\"What the hell? Why?\"\n\"Well, I could say I have to, that I think you'd track me down and catch me when my batteries ran out, but that'd be bullshit, because I'd do it anyway. Or I could ask you why the hell you want to live a couple more years if your life is so unpleasant. But that'd be bullshit, too, because I really don't care. No, the reason I'm going to kill you is that the world'll be a more beautiful place without you.\"\nA long pause. \"You're a pretty crazy fucker.\"\n\"You might want to run, you know. I doubt it'll do much good, but it's traditional.\"\nAnother long silence. The shotgun's hollow boom makes it permanent.\nAlone again, which is how I like it. Any place, even this rotting patch of highway with free finest-quality geezer carcass no extra charge, is nicer when you're alone. Something to do with the ancient territorial instinct, I think; the old urge to piss on a tree. I have a lot of trees to piss on these days, and it feels good.\nCurtis Yarvin hatched in Maryland, larvated in the tepid waters of Brown University, and will shortly be pupating in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.

Regon threw himself away, hand by Vicki L. Martin clawing for his own holstered SW&R. The move was trained, Copyright (c) 1993 instinctive; he'd never draw and fire in time.\"\nJames Regon pulled his eye away from the retinal scanner and thought, `I hate this. I really, seriously hate this.'\nHe shot nervous fingers through his short-cropped black hair. The Polliwog behind the flexiscreen web, her red-tipped snout shining, hurried him into the back room with perfunctory politeness.\nMidnight blue eyes studied his newest possession. `Gahd, what a head of hair!'\nRiotous copper curls lay limp on bony shoulders. The young human sat in an unreliable chair, clad in a beige sweater two sizes too large for his slender body.\nHis hands were securely tied behind his back.\nRegon slit the ropes with a single swipe of his knife, said, \"Let's go,\" and started out the back door.\nThe man rubbed the ropes off his wrists and studied Regon with renewed wariness. \"Where are we going?\"\n\"I'll explain later, after we're clear of the market.\" When the stranger still refused to come along, Regon hissed, \"Look, unless you want to get caught up in some very nasty attempts on my life, I'd suggest you move.\"\nGreen eyes blinked twice before the man followed Regon out the back door and along the alley.\nThe pair slipped out of the alley beside a sweet-scented confectioner's shop and mixed with the crowds. The younger man threw hungry glances toward every food booth they passed.\nThough refusing to stop, Regon dug a meat roll from his pouch and passed it across. The man tore into the bread-wrapped sausage.\n\"What's your name?\" Regon asked.\n\"Erik,\" he mumbled around an overfull mouth. \"Erik Milhollin. You?\"\n\"Regon.\" He eyed the quickly vanishing meat roll. \"You're not half hungry, are you?\"\n\"You'd be hungry, too, if you hadn't eaten in three days.\"\n\"I thought the Polliwogs treated their merchandise better than that.\"\n\"Most times they do. They only hold off on the food when the 'merchandise' still has a mind of its own.\"\nRegon grinned, pleased that he'd read the signs right. \"Bit of trouble, were you?\"\n\"Enough.\" Erik wiped his hands clean on the seat of his pants, favored Regon with a look of distrustful speculation, and asked, \"So when you plan on jumping me?\"\n\"Jumping you?\"\n\"That's what you bought me for, innit? Big he-merc like you doesn't go to the market unless he's buying something for his bed.\"\nRegon laughed. \"Not this time, mate. I've got other plans for you.\"\nCat eyes darkened. \"I won't work the streets for you.\"\nSight of two familiar faces in the crowd to their rear drove the chosen retort from Regon's mind. Instead, he asked, \"How good a fighter are you?\"\n\"Why do you think I was tied up?\"\n\"If you get into trouble, put your back into the nearest corner and stay the hell out of my way.\"\n\"Promise me another sausage roll and a warm ale, and I'd fight half the Polliwog army with you.\"\n\"You're on, friend.\"\nThough expecting an attack, Regon was almost too late turning to meet the first man's rush. Sidestepping a knife aimed at his right kidney, he chopped at the conveniently presented neck and danced away. A backswung leg effectively destroyed the man's balance.\nA hard shove sent him flying even further away.\nAll around them, market shoppers screamed and fled. Voices raised in fear and warning filled the air. Panic reigned.\nTwo more attackers closed in from behind. Regon wheeled; he might evade one, but he'd never dodge the other. The nearer, larger of the pair, moved in first. A fifteen inch jungle knife filled one hand; a round-tipped stun-rod filled the other.\nSame old Neville.\nThe stun rod swept in low, aimed for Regon's genitals. An electric jangle shot up his trouser leg.\nTo protect his vulnerable back, Regon turned Neville's attack energy against him, reversing their positions; Neville's body blocked the second man's attack.\nRegon spared a quick glance around. Terror had cleared the street, leaving the five humans momentarily alone. His first attacker--a free-lance assassin named Sills--sprawled in a heap, his head bloody where he'd collided with a nearby wall.\nErik danced with the third attacker.\nRegon turned back in time to avoid Neville's second strike with the stun rod. He bulled his way inside Neville's reach, too close for the larger man to use the rod effectively. Before Neville could bring either of his weapons to bear, Regon caught the man in his fist and twisted. Hard.\nNeville screamed; the fluting screech brought a cold smile to Regon's lips. Regon's other hand snatched away the man's knife, twisted it around, and hissed the razor edge across the man's throat.\nTwisting about, Regon stopped, slowed by surprise. Sills had recovered\nenough to pull himself off the dirty pavement and draw a short-barreled breastpin gun from a concealed pocket. The barrel lifted, aimed at Milhollin's unsuspecting back.\n\"Erik! Behind you!\"\nRegon's shout brought Sills back around, the barrel realigning. Regon threw himself away, hand clawing for his own holstered SW&R. The move was trained, instinctive; he'd never draw and fire in time.\nThe breastpin spat. Its load--a thin, steel pin no longer than a fingernail--caught Regon in the left arm. Pain made him lose hold of his half-drawn weapon. He sprawled on the pavement, stunned and helpless.\nA victorious grin split Sills's face. He steadied the breastpin for a second, fatal, shot.\nRegon knew he should react some way, should try to recover his own weapon. He couldn't move.\n`Stupid way to die,' Regon thought. `Never should've bid in public thataway.'\nThe breastpin fired again.\nA body hurled between Regon and Sills. A barked cry cut off abruptly as the figure landed on the street. Blood from a tiny hole under one shoulder blade marked the missile's exit point.\nSomewhere in the fractured seconds of the attack, Erik saw Regon's danger. He caught his man by the lapel and hurled him into the path of the needle.\nErik's knife sank to the hilt just below Sills' breastbone before the killer could realize his mistake.\nRegon's vision wavered, shivering in a gray fog. Sure fingers fiddled with his jacket sleeve, tying off the arm to slow the bleeding.\n\"Talk to me, Regon. I don't know this city. I don't even know anything about this planet. Tell me where to take you.\"\nRegon harvested the scattered threads of his reason. He accepted Erik's help, leaning heavily on the narrow shoulders, and pointed up the street.\n\"Two--three--blocks down, turn right. Hover rental shop on the right.\"\nThey shuffled along, ignoring frightened and curious looks from the emerging crowd. Regon fished an activation chip from his pouch. He handed it to his companion then let his mind drift.\nRegon sank gratefully into the soft cushions of the hovercar and watched buildings and city parks whiz past. He wondered at himself. It wasn't like him to yield to anyone, especially not a complete stranger--a man he'd just bought off a Polgish slave block.\nThe initial shock of injury wore off even as the pain increased. Warmed by the full-blowing heating unit, he dug his way back to reasoning thought and studied his companion.\n`What makes me want to trust him? I've never accepted anyone like this in my entire life. So he saved my life. I work solo. I'm trained. I shouldn't be able to trust anyone until I know a lot more about them than I know about this Erik Milhollin. I don't--I won't--trust anyone. My mission is too important. I don't dare risk it.'\n\"Are we going to fly around the city in circles,\" Erik asked, \"or are you going to tell me where we're going?\"\n\"Take the Millish Expressway--the northbound just ahead. I'll tell you where to go from there.\" He studied the curl- crowned profile. \"You saved my life-- why? You could've let them kill me. You'd've been free.\"\n\"You still owe me a sausage roll and a tankard of warm ale. Can't collect those off a corpse. Besides, the instant the Polliwog law found your body, they'd decide I did it, then where would I be?\"\n\"You've got a point,\" Regon agreed.\nErik took his eyes off the hover lane long enough to study the wound. \"We'll need to stop and take care of that soon. Will we be driving long?\"\n\"Long enough. Stay on the Millish northbound 'til I say otherwise.\"\n\"Yes, master.\"\nThe dry mockery in the deep voice brought a smile to Regon's lips. Warm and comfortable, he sank into the cushions and closed his eyes.\nRegon jerked awake again, aware that he'd lost consciousness. The single-room cabin smelled pleasantly of processed stew.\nA steaming mug of coffee bobbed in front of his nose.\n\"Don't know what your job is, friend,\" merriment filled Milhollin's voice, \"but it must pull a lot of credit. Haven't seen a legitimate Terran brew or a good Malt Scotch in over ten years.\"\n\"I have a private supplier.\" Regon eyed the glass of liquor in his companion's hand; a dark eyebrow rose.\n\"Sorry, helped myself.\" Milhollin saluted him with the cup. \"Would've got you some, too, but I gave you a hypo of pain cleaner a couple hours ago. Can't mix the two, can we?\"\n\"How did you know how to get here?\"\n\"Found a fiber map in your pocket.\"\nThey devoured a full meal as the second of Polgish Three's two suns disappeared over the western horizon. Drowsy, Regon saw no reason to move. Milhollin set the dirty dishes in the portable wash unit, stored away the leftovers, and returned to the bed.\nFeeling the need to fill the silence with conversation, Regon asked, \"What were you doing on the Polgish slave block?\"\n\"Wrong place at the wrong time. My Mam was a systems merchant. We'd flit about the quadrant, shipping this, hauling that.\"\n\"Lemme guess. Someone slipped something into a cargo.\"\n\"The honest reputation she'd spent forty years building didn't do her a bit of good. And because we'd been so honest, we didn't have enough money for a good lawyer.\"\n\"What happened to her?\"\n\"Last I saw of her, we were in the Sentencing Chamber. When they gave me the block ... she had a seizure. No one ever told me what happened.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nMilhollin shrugged off his concern. \"I think it's about time you told me what you were doing at the market today. If it wasn't for a tight bottom for your bed, what was it?\"\nRegon studied the younger, smaller man and gauged his potential-- as partner, co-conspirator, or threat. Regon sat up in bed, and motioned for Milhollin to close the light screens.\n\"I'm a ... well, my business is my own. It's honest and legal. As you noticed, it pays well, too. I call it 'corrective adjustment'.\"\nMilhollin sat on the foot of the bed, expressionless but alert.\n`At least he's not already retreating,' Regon reasoned. \"I've been hired to stop a Polgish criminal named Sorin. He has a bodyguard named Keishie, a female Polliwog with rather exotic tastes.\"\nA hard glint marred Milhollin's eyes. \"I suit her ... exotic tastes.\"\n\"You won't do anything physical. Just draw her away from Sorin long enough to give me a shot at him.\"\n\"You're an assassin.\"\n\"The man's a sadist, Milhollin. He gets a charge torturing innocent children. He flaunts it, bragging how he's above the law. Someone's got to stop him, and by god, it's going to be me!\"\nMilhollin leaned away from him, as much to protect his ears as to gain breathing space. Regon sat back against the headboard.\n\"I intend to get him,\" Regon said, \"one way or another. Will you help me?\"\n\"If I don't?\"\n\"I'll tie you up and leave you here. Kill you if I have to.\"\n\"You'd do that after I saved your life?\"\n\"I don't have a choice. I can't afford loose ends.\"\nMilhollin snarled an oath, leaped off the bed and raced out the door.\nHis arm aching despite the medication, Regon slammed a fist down on a bedside control box. He threw off the covers and ran to the door.\nIn the light-flooded drive, Erik reached for the hovercar door, only to cry out and fall back, unprepared for the security system Regon had activated. Spying Regon on the covered porch, Erik sprinted towards the trees, ignoring the agent's shouted warning.\nErik fetched up against the static fence running full speed. He grunted, every bit of wind knock from his chest, and fell to the ground, nerves twitching from the shock. Though stunned, the space nav scrambled onto his hands and knees.\n\"If you're thinking to get away in some other direction,\" Regon warned, \"don't.\"\nErik tottered to his feet, determined to face his killer with his head high. \"Get it over with, then. Go on. Shoot! Just don't expect me to beg you off.\"\nRegon cocked an eyebrow at the gun in his hand; he didn't even remember picking it up. A smile, half mocking, half ironic, raised one corner of his mouth. He motioned toward the building.\n\"Inside, friend. We'll talk about this some more.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Get in the cabin, Erik. Now.\"\n\"Go to hell!\"\n\"Stubborn--.\"\nRegon slammed the brakes on his anger. Trading temper for temper was not the best way to deal with Erik Milhollin.\n\"Look, I won't hurt you unless you give me a reason to. Will you please go into the house? It's cold out here.\"\nErik hesitated a moment more, then stumbled toward the porch, wobbly on unsteady legs.\nRegon moved with only slightly more grace. Closing and sealing the door behind him, he tumbled onto the mattress and deactivated the exterior security lights but left the screens activated.\nErik draped the other side of the bed, gasping and shuddering.\n\"That was dumb,\" Regon said. \"You were lucky I preset the fence to stun.\"\nA plump pillow under his face muffled Erik's response. \"Hoo-bloody-ray.\"\n\"Look, Erik, I'm not asking you to do anything illegal or even immoral. All I need is Keishie away from the door for two minutes. After that, you're free to go anywhere you like. I'll give you your papers, sign you a free man.\"\n\"I don't really give a damn.\"\n\"I'll help you find your Mam.\"\nErik's body tensed. The curls lifted.\nSensing possible victory, Regon pressed, \"I have contacts. Help me get at Sorin. You'll earn your freedom and find your mother.\"\nErik's lips pressed into a mirthless grin. \"Mum's freedom.\"\n\"I can't promise to swing that.\"\n\"I'll help you. I'll give up my own freedom, stay to do whatever dirty work you want, if you'll get Mam back on her ship.\"\nRegon sucked on the inside of his cheek, thinking the option through, though the simple act of future estimation was more difficult than it should have been. He forced his stiff, aching body off the bed and plopped himself down before the small communit set into the wall.\nWhen Erik sought to watch, he sternly commanded him back to the bed.\nRegon played with the keys for ten minutes then sighed and sat back, rubbing his aching temples. Erik sat rigid on the edge of the bed, wringing his hands in unconscious distress.\n\"It's a deal.\"\nErik's face brightened.\n\"You know where she is?\"\nRegon motioned him over. Erik bounded across the room and examined the screen.\n\"The seizure wasn't severe,\" Regon reported. \"She was released from hospital two days after the sentencing. Transported to Labor Camp Ten-A-Nine. That's the most minimum security facility on Krinosh. She'll be safe there until we do what needs doing.\"\n\"Get her out now.\"\n\"Oh, no. I don't know you, Erik Milhollin. I don't know if I trust you to go through with it if you think you've already had your way. She's free when the job is done, not before.\"\n\"And if you botch the job? What then?\"\n\"I've left a written statement with my employer. If it goes sour because of something I did or some hazard I didn't foresee, she'll be given her pardon.\"\nRegon deactivated the communit and stood up. He wanted that bed even more than he wanted revenge against Sorin. \"Since that's settled, I think I'll--.\" A wave of cold-heat swept over his face; his eyes blurred. \"Wha--?\"\nErik caught him as he started a slow slide toward the floor. Regon's vision tunneled down.\n\"Sh'd've known ... Sills ... always liked to f-f-fiddle his needles.\"\nErik swallowed. \"Poison?\"\n\"Naw ... just ... be sick awhile.\" Vicious chills rattled his teeth. \"S-s-s--oh damn. 'm sorry.\"\nErik said something more, but Regon was too far lost in sickness to hear, or care.\n`I can't believe I'm doing this. I've fixed the security codes on the hovercar. With the credsticks I found hidden around the cabin, I can get off this miserable rock. If it weren't for the chance of getting Mam out, I'd've left days ago.'\nErik sobered, honest with himself. `No, I wouldn't have. I wouldn't leave a mudworm in this sorry state. Even a paid assassin deserves help when he's sick.'\nThe smaller man replaced the moist cloth across Regon's forehead and struggled to make sense of the sick man's disjointed mumbling. He spoke mainly of people and places Erik had never heard\nof. Something occasionally slipped through, an emotion or action, that he found recognizable.\n`I wonder who 'Eliza' is. Regon's certainly heaped some colorful abuse on that one's head, but I don't feel there's anything malicious behind it--more fondness than resentment.\nSorin, though, is different. There's real hate there. It's not abstract, either--no hatred for collective sins. There's something personal here. Regon's come up against this particular Polliwog before, and it's left him scarred.\nWhat sort of nightmare am I mixed up in?'\nRegon's mumbles spiraled down into another deep sleep. Erik pulled the coverlet further up over the shivering shoulders and let the man sleep.\nFor three days he cared for the delirious man. If he didn't have his hands full with Regon, he was bored half out of his mind for lack of anything to do. Whatever else Regon might be, he was neither reader nor gamester; there wasn't a single book or computer game anywhere in the cabin, nothing to wile away the hours except a tatty deck of cards.\nLeft with hours of loose ends, Erik had bent his curiosity and skill to the communit. `This is pretty impressive, and I haven't even touched the restricted files yet. This Regon ... he isn't the assassin I thought he was. He's somehow connected to GIP. Haven't figured out how yet, but I will before I'm finished.'\n\"How ... how did you ... get on that?\"\nErik looked up. Though weak as a newborn babe, Regon stared back with delirium-clear eyes. Erik shifted his own gaze to the chrono on the wall.\n`No wonder my spine's talking to me. I've been sitting at this thing for hours!'\nErik closed the unit and came to the bed. Regon's skin, though pinched and pale, no longer burned his fingers.\n\"Good, your fever's broken. About time.\"\n\"Where did you ... get the axe code ... my communit?\"\n\"You gave it to me. Saw you use it that first day.\" Erik pointed to the polished chrome side of the kitchen storage unit. \"Saw your reflection in that. Handy trick every space nav and pilot picks up, learning to read mirror images.\"\n\"What did you ... find out?\"\n\"Nothing you'd mind me knowing. I was careful to stay out of the restricts. I know you're latched to GIP some way; haven't quite figured out how yet. I mean, Galactic Intelligence Prime are more famous for arresting assassins than for hiring them.\"\n\"I'm not an assassin. At least ... not the kind you're thinking of.\"\n\"The thought has crossed my mind a couple of times over the last three days, yeah.\"\n\"Three ... three days?\"\nErik controlled a budding smile. \"Closer to four. Whatever was on the needle, it certainly did its job on you.\"\n\"Three days wasted ...\"\n\"Nearer four. Hungry?\"\nDiverted, Regon pulled a tired face. \"Not really ... but I need something anyway.\"\nErik returned within minutes with a meal for the invalid. He spoon-fed Regon a light portion of the broth and bread. A quite comfortable air hung between them, enough so that Erik risked trying to satisfy his curiosity.\n\"You talked a bit ... delirious with fever.\"\n\"Nothing offensive, I hope.\"\n\"Just names and places, and a few snatches of conversation. You mentioned Sorin several times, and never in a very commendable light.\"\n\"He is not a very commendable being.\"\n\"I'm beginning to see that.\" Since Regon hadn't objected to his references to Sorin, he felt it safe to ask, \"Who is Eliza?\"\nRegon stiffened. Dark blue eyes hardened to mica flints. Erik retreated before the powerful glare.\n\"Eliza is none of your business.\"\nErik left the bed, taking the meal tray with him; he tried but failed to match Regon's gaze. \"Sorry.\"\nRegon studied the stiff set to the slender shoulders and regretted his fury. Exhausted physically and emotionally, he relaxed on the bed. He drifted in mental limbo, too weak to rise but too wound up to sleep. He was only vaguely aware when Erik, having put away the food and set the dishes to clean, moved to the bedside and stripped off his clothes.\nErik extinguished the light. Exterior darkness flooded through the heavily curtained windows, throwing the room into utter darkness.\nThe bed rocked, a sudden quaking of the air mattress. The cover raised; cool air brushed him from shoulder to hip. A warm body stretched out at his side, replacing the cover and displaced heat.\nUnease thickened the air around them. Regon didn't like it in the least.\n\"Sorry. It's just ... a private subject.\"\n\"I understand. My fault for pressing. Go to sleep, Regon.\"\n\"Erik?\"\n\"Mmm?\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nThe phenomenally wealthy citizens of Yulith Cote resided on The Hill, a single rise located almost dead center of the metropolis. Seated in the hopper, the two men studied the well-fortified ten-story steel and weather-glass structure behind the thirty foot static wall.\n\"That Sorin's place?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nA reddish eyebrow vanished beneath copper ringlets. \"Ever think of breaking into the planetary treasury? You'd have better luck.\"\n\"I don't plan on taking him here,\" Regon said; he activated the hover's air pumps and set the vehicle moving again. \"There's a dive in the Lower City he frequents, sometimes only every two or three seasons, but it's the one haunt where I know I'll eventually see him.\"\n\"What sort of place is it?\"\n\"Procuring house.\"\n\"Girls?\"\n\"On the surface. It's secret trade is children, all sexes, all species. I'll wager the oldest Human child in the place is probably around ten.\"\nErik paled. \"You can't be serious. Ten years ... they're bloody babies!\"\n\"My employer's kept watch on the place for years but could never find a loophole in the system that would shut them down. We intercept their transports as often as we can but a few ships always get through. We've even outbid them at the block, just to keep the babes out of their hands.\"\n\"'We' being GIP?\"\nRegon shook his head. \"I didn't say that.\"\nErik smiled. \"I know.\"\nRegon tooled the hovercar down the\ntubes with near-reckless speed. Erik had to admire his competence at the controls--it wasn't too many who could so casually control a careening hunk of metal skimming on a bed of air.\nThe hover moved constantly downhill. The buildings beyond the weather-glass domes of the tubes grew increasingly dense. Prosperity and glit decreased in direct proportion to age and decay. By the time Regon shifted them onto one of the uncovered open-ground paths that led into the lowermost sections of Yulith Cote, they were surrounded by nothing but trash, destruction, and filth.\n\"There's been a surveilling team on the place the last two seasons. Sorin's sure to visit, probably tonight or tomorrow, within the next sevenday at the outside.\"\n\"How can you be sure?\"\nRegon pointed to a message flashing across the hovercar's portable communit. \"A new shipment arrived at the spaceport just this morning. Sorin's bound to want first choice.\"\n\"Who's sending that?\"\n\"The surveilling team. Even I don't know where they're watching from, and it's not good policy to try and spot them. They're a strange lot. Most of them aren't even human, and they don't like having all their hard work blown by a couple of nosy agents.\"\n\"I'm not an agent. I'm a distraction.\"\nRegon resisted smiling only by a supreme effort of will. He couldn't, however, control the merry dance of his eyes.\n\"It won't matter to the surveilling teams. Anyone who spots their watchposts soon wishes he hadn't.\"\nRegon parked the hover in a Pay N' Protect sealed lot and led his companion into a gray tenement three longish blocks from the procuring house. Staring through the glassless window frame, he pointed to the squat building down the way.\n\"That's the Blue Cushion. Don't let the face fool you. Inside, it's a palace. Supposedly a bawdy house for free-trade prostitutes, it's owned and run by a half- Human named Brand.\"\n\"What's his other half?\"\n\"Hell devil. He's the one who hooked Sorin on Human children. He caters to Sorin's vices and provides him with a private 'sampling room'. There's talk he even joins the Polliwog in his 'games'.\"\n\"Why hasn't the law closed him down? Raping underagers is illegal in every known species.\"\n\"It's simple, really. On Polgish, the Final Judiciary for Sex- Related Crimes is a slimy worm named Kemmosh. A true politician, smooth as silk, with a taste for young flesh. All Brand's lawyer has to do is put the case before Kemmosh, and it'll get flushed out the nearest disposal tube.\"\n\"How can space sludge like that exist?\"\n\"After tonight, it won't. At least not in Sorin's case.\"\n\"So what happens?\"\n\"When Sorin comes, he'll do it openly. He's so sure of himself he doesn't even try to hide his tastes. Keishie will stand outside the main door, knocking away any other customers. That door is, by the way, the only known way into the building. There is another, the one the shipments are brought through, but it's so well hidden, not even the surveilling team's been able to find it.\"\n\"Where do I fit in?\"\n\"Your job is to lure Keishie away from the door for the two minutes I'll need to deactivate the warning alarms and get inside the building. How you do is up to you.\"\n\"This Keishie--she the kind that likes the big-eyed, frail, helpless types?\"\n\"From what I could tell, yeah. Though she usually goes for sun-gold blonds.\"\n\"Once you're inside, then what?\"\n\"Then you're free to go.\"\n\"But what about my Mam?\"\nRegon offered his first truly honest smile. \"She's already pardoned. I imagine she's already back on her ship, on her way to pick you up.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nRegon drew meaningless figures in the blown dust covering the window sill. \"You didn't have to tend me when I was sick. I owe you for that. Before we left the cabin, I arranged full pardons for both you and your Mam. She has her ship back, and both pardons in her pocket. If she goes at top transport speed, she'll be at the spaceport by noon day after tomorrow.\"\nRegon dug a small pouch from a pocket and handed it over.\n\"There's a temporary freedom receipt in there, and enough credsticks to tide you until your Mam gets here.\"\nErik stared from the wallet to Regon and back; he didn't immediately accept the offering. \"Why are you doing this? It wasn't part of our deal.\"\n\"I want Sorin. You've agreed to help me, that's reason enough. The fact that you saved my life--twice--might have something to do with it.\"\n\"I didn't do it for a reward, not even this one.\" Erik slapped the pouch away, his temper simmering. \"I'll do whatever I have to do to save my Mam, but I won't be bribed into helping you. If what you've said about this Sorin is true, I want to stop him for that reason alone.\"\n\"It's what you first asked for, and I never denied it, did I? You added the condition of your Mother's safety later. I want Sorin, Erik. Help me get him.\"\nErik hesitated a final moment before accepting the pouch.\n\"Thank you. Without you ...\" Regon shook like a dog ridding itself of an unwelcome bath and pasted a cheery smile onto his face. \"You'd better snatch what rest you can. Oh, and one of the surveilling team will be by later on tonight with some clothes for you.\"\n\"Clothes?\" Erik studied the sweater and trousers he wore. \"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?\"\n\"Not exactly provocative. Won't make Keishie's eyes pop.\"\n\"No, guess not.\"\nExpecting Regon to do likewise, Erik made himself as comfortable as possible on the bare floor. He watched as the larger man instead took up a post beside the window, eyes still on the Blue Cushion.\n\"You should rest, too,\" Erik said. \"You're still not over that tainted dart. It doesn't make sense to go up against the Sorin without a proper sleep under your ear.\"\n\"I'm fine. I've spent so much of the last few days sleeping, I don't think I ever want to close my eyes--or see another bed--for at least a full cycle.\"\nErik laughed. Reassured, he settled down to get what rest he could in the unsavory surroundings.\n\"It'll be tonight. I can feel it, 'Liza. It'll all be over tonight. I'll finally settle with that sadistic beast.\"\nThe soft-spoken words roused Erik\nfrom a light sleep. Camped in the darkest corner of the bare room, he watched the man seated beside the window, his indistinct figure lit by a ghostly glow from the dimmed communit screen.\nRegon, unaware of his audience, stared at the points of light that marked the Blue Cushion's entryway. His voice fell to its lowest register, ripe with silky promise.\n\"I'll see you tonight, Sorin. I'll finally meet you face to face.\"\nErik's skin wiggled under the undisguised enmity in the throaty purr.\n`Finally meet Sorin, he said. That means they've never met before. How could he hate Sorin so much? Maybe it has something to do with this Eliza.'\nRay shifted to relieve a sore spot on one bum cheek. Regon reacted to the slight sound, his weapon out and ready before he consciously thought to draw it.\nErik glanced at the gun and cooed, \"Twitchy.\"\n\"Could get your head shot off making sudden sounds like that.\" Regon shoved the gun back into its holster.\n\"Sorry, didn't know there was another way to move.\" He joined Regon at the window but could see nothing but pins of light all across the city. \"You want to catch a little sleep? I'll watch for awhile.\"\n\"No.\"\nThere wasn't really room at the one window for both men to watch in comfort, but Erik had no interest in going back to sleep. He leaned his back against the wall and stared at the room's door, his thoughts on a speeding cargo transport and an upcoming reunion.\n\"Gerrom came by while you were asleep,\" Regon said. He jerked a thumb at a crate set against the far wall in a patch of bright moonlight. \"Your wardrobe. Let's have a look.\"\nRegon examined the contents under the pin-point glow of a wrist-light. Milhollin didn't like the larger man's nasty chuckle.\n\"You'll look smashing in this little bit.\"\n\"Little?\"\n\"Very little.\"\nMilhollin activated his own wrist-band torch and nudged Regon aside. \"Lemme at that. If I'm going through with this, I get to pick what I wear.\"\n\"You're no fun,\" Regon sighed, but moved back to the window, leaving Milhollin to sort through the trunk at his leisure.\nDown on the street, Erik followed the more experienced man around the darkened turns. They seemed to walk forever. Within five minutes, Erik was totally and in all ways, lost; Regon was obviously coming at the place from a totally different direction. Within five more minutes, he heartily wished Regon would slow down.\nFive more after that, legs aching and lungs burning, he seriously considered canceling his agreement. He wondered if the Blue Cushion was their destination at all.\nRegon stopped so suddenly Erik ran into him from behind. Sight of the Blue Cushion two doors ahead of them prevented any dangerous outburst.\nA single figure stood before the entrance, a round, piggish Polgishin, highly visible in a heavy black jacket with enough metal decoration to outfit a small hover.\n\"Is that Keishie?\" he whispered.\nRegon nodded.\n\"Well,\" Erik sighed, \"let's get this over with, shall we?\"\n\"Erik ...\"\nErik turned at the soft, almost humble lilt in Regon's voice. Regon stood with weapon drawn. For an insane second, he thought Regon intended to shoot him. He relaxed when the Terra SW&R shifted towards the procuring house.\nRegon was too busy studying his shoe tops to notice Erik's momentary start of fright.\n\"I'll cover you long as I can,\" he promised, \"but once I'm at the door, you're on your own. Are you sure--?\"\n\"Yes. One question, though. Why don't you just shoot Keishie and save all this bother?\"\n\"Because GIP has a charter with the Polgish government that protects guarders like Keishie. Unless she takes an active part in her employer's perverted games, her only crime is doing the job she was hired to do. It I take Sorin down while he's busy playing, it'll be a justifiable case.\"\nErik nodded, understanding. \"But if you ambush his guarder without good cause, you're flushed out the dispose-all, right?\"\n\"Right.\" Regon shifted his weapon to his left hand and held his right out to Erik. \"Thank you again. I hope everything works out for you and your Mam.\"\n\"One favor before I go off.\" Erik's grimace was visible even in the faint light. \"Hit me.\"\nRegon's left eyebrow shot up. \"Whazzat?\"\n\"You heard me. Hit me. Someplace it'll show.\"\n\"You said ... hit you?\"\nErik's green eyes snapped. \"Yes, hit me! It's part of my cover.\"\nEven though Erik demanded the move, Regon's hand came up so quickly, the smaller man had no chance to flinch away. Regon's knuckles left a readily visible swelling on Erik's left cheek. A trickle of blood from his nose completed the desired effect.\nErik moaned and cradled his cheek. \"I said 'it me, no' knock m' 'ead off!\"\n\"Sorry, didn't know there was any other way to hit.\"\nErik started to move off, only to have Regon call him back.\n\"Erik.\" Seeing he had the younger man's attention, Regon said, \"Eliza was ... she was one of the first Humans Sorin took ... she was just seven years old. ... They never ... they never found ... She was my daughter.\"\nRegon disappeared before Erik could do more than lose hold of his jaw.\nFrom his new vantage point, Regon could see the entire street. Less than two minutes after he settled in, Erik appeared around the far corner in a stumbling, twisting run. Regon rose halfway to his feet before he realized it was all part of Erik's \"lure\".\n`He is good,' Regon's mind-voice rang with admiration. `If I didn't know I blacked him up, I'd swear he was the defenseless, cuddly little gamin he's pretending to be.'\nErik stumbled up the road, the perfect picture of a lost, shocky babe, eyes wide, full lips opened enough to tempt but not tease.\nHe moved with a carnal glide that was more instinctive than deliberate, with just enough \"woe-is-me\" to cast away any suspicions Keishie might have.\nTurning, Regon found the Polliwog's\neyes sealed on the approaching figure. The twitching around her bulbous nose, the batting of her heavy eyelashes and the jerking of one knee all proved her interest.\nErik slumped against the wall directly across the street from Keishie, the image of helplessness. He tipped his head just enough so the guarder could see his damaged face.\n\"Looks like you were done bad by someone,\" Keishie called across the way. \"Need help?\"\n\"Please, they ... I didn't want ... four of them wanted me to ... not all of them at once, I couldn't--!\" He turned wide, pleading eyes toward the guarder, cat green turned almost liquid silver in the vague glow from a nearby streetlight.\nRegon wanted to laugh at the effeminate quiver in Erik's voice.\nKeishie gave the door behind her a measured glance then crossed the street to stand beside Erik.\n\"Don't worry, little one.\" Keishie rubbed Erik's back in a calming caress. \"I'll take care of you.\"\n`I just bet you will,' Regon thought.\nKeishie and Erik moved down the street, the larger Polliwog guiding the \"stumbling\" Human. Regon watched them go, a curiously reluctant flutter in his chest; if Keishie decided to play rough, Erik wouldn't be able to fight her off.\nHe should never have coerced the pilot into helping him. It made Regon no better than Sorin, taking what he wanted without permission.\nThe instant the two figures disappeared from sight, Regon raced through the blackest shadows. He squatted in the lit entry, his nose less than three inches from the entrance lock.\nIt took him longer to get inside than he'd expected. Brand had installed a new locking system since last Regon had surveyed the place. Still, he was somewhat familiar with the design, and skillfully bypassed Brand's few custom touches.\nSmall plug glows down by the baseboards offered dim light. Cushioned chairs and settees of various blue shades touched with silver sat scattered around the room. Wall sconces burned at their lowest setting.\nHe spent a solid ten minutes searching for the basement entrance, and another five figuring out how to open the portal without triggering any alarms. By the time he shifted the settee to the side, taking a bit of floor with it, Regon's nerves were drawn uncomfortably tight.\nHe descended the narrow stairs. The settee slid back into place above him, tossing the descent into pitch blackness.\nRegon lit the way with his wrist-light. Ahead stretched a long, unbroken corridor with a single door faintly visible on the far end.\nEvery instinct Regon possessed warned him not to go on. Brand must have one or two nasty surprises waiting for anyone who penetrated his security.\nRegon studied the way ahead, sweeping the ceiling, floors, and walls with the wrist-light. Nothing aroused his suspicions, yet his subconscious still screamed danger.\nRegon hugged the wall, mindful of traps and triggers. He moved an inch at a time, pausing every few breaths to study his next move.\nLess than five feet from the door, a faint snapping noise brought Regon around. A hidden plate plunged from the ceiling to block his retreat. A second identical plate slammed down directly in front of the door, effectively sealing him in.\nThe hiss of displaced air was loud in the confined space, as was the purr of machinery somewhere beyond the walls. Regon gagged and collapsed, hands clawing alternately for his throat and a small explosive charge in his utility pouch. Black flashes behind his eyes led him to the floor, and unconsciousness.\nThe pain of lost circulation in his hands roused Regon from the comfortable warmth of his own dimmed mind. A chill wind against his bare skin roused him still more.\nOpening bleary eyes, he surveyed his surroundings, slowly remembering the cause of his condition.\n`Amateurish,' he railed at himself. `Oldest trap in the books and I walked straight into it! The boss'll dance on my blushing hide when he finds out.'\nBlinking against the bright light of the large chamber, Regon turned at the sound of soft whimpering toward his back. His heart seized.\nTwo small cages stood against the far wall. A dozen children of five different races huddled behind the bars, terrified and helpless. One, a small Human male with bright red curls and pale green eyes, studied him back, fire and fear melding in his open gaze.\n`Oh gawd, they're just babies! The oldest can't be more than eight!'\nA lock disengaged. The children scampered to the farthest reaches of their prison, huddling in terror. Regon, bound hand and foot, naked as the day he popped out, rolled over onto his back.\nSorin and Brand entered the pleasure chamber, matching expressions of triumph on their faces.\nBrand stopped beside Regon, a towering mountain.\n\"Who are you?\"\nRegon sealed his lips, letting his cold, hard eyes speak for him.\n\"I said who are you?\"\nRegon stared and said nothing.\n\"It doesn't matter, I suppose,\" Brand said. \"It's just as well you're here, though. Saves me the loss.\"\nConfusion colored Regon's thoughts, though no flicker of an eyelash betrayed it to his captors.\n\"You'll do nicely as an example to my new toys, and it'll save me the financial loss of using one of them.\" Brand turned to Sorin and indicated the children. \"Like what you see? They arrived less than an hour ago. Each one's as virgin as the snows on Mount Taowl.\"\nSorin studied the cages and drooled, his left knee jerking out of control; Regon wanted to throw up.\nBrand lashed a filament cable through Regon's wrist restraints. Regon wiggled and squirmed, doing his best to punch Brand's face. For lack of any other defense, he even tried to bite the man. It did no good.\nA small winch took up the slack in the line until Regon hung several inches above the floor, his ankles still bound to a ring mortared into the foundation. Stretched between the two, his shoulders and hips felt torn from their sockets.\nBrand moved over to the children, smiling at their terrified hiccups and whimpers.\n\"This is a lesson you'd all better learn. You do what I say, when I say, to whoever I tell you to do it to. If you don't, you'll get just what I'm about to give\nhim.\" Brand pointed to Regon, then repeated his speech in four different languages.\nRegon clamped his teeth down on an oath. Brand moved to one of the supply cabinets set against the left wall and withdrew a small injector tube. The procurer moved to stand before Regon, but his words were for the children.\n\"This is a drug--Jupiin--that makes the body feel more than usual. It will make whatever we do to him seem even worse than it is.\"\nRegon twisted, trying to avoid the small cluster of needles aimed at his left shoulder. The cold sting of injection faded before his rage.\nA weak tingling spread from the injection site to every nerve in his body. It wasn't precisely unpleasant, more like the euphoria just after a hard battle, an awareness of every nerve ending and skin cell.\nSorin brushed cold fingertips down Regon's ribs. Acid fire burned his mind. He bit off an instinctive scream but could not hold down a moan.\nWhen Sorin's hands closed on other portions of his body, Regon thrashed about, half-mad with agony. The need to scream overcame every physical and mental effort to control it, and carried on forever.\nBetween his helpless act and playing hard-to-get, Erik Milhollin kept Keishie occupied for a solid half-hour before figuring he'd given Regon enough time.\nFinding a way to slip away from the interested Polgishin hadn't been easy. Erik managed it with the help of a conveniently placed street walker who attracted the Polliwog's eye. Tall, blond, young and slender, with big, sad blue eyes, he was much more Keishie's type, and more willing to entertain than Erik.\nErik slipped away while Keishie and the teenage whore made their acquaintance. In search of a hire-hover, he'd moved only two blocks before he realized he'd headed in the direction of the Blue Cushion.\n`Why did I come this way? I've paid my debt. My face hurts and I'm tired down to the bone. I have my freedom chit, enough credsticks to live on, and the spaceport's in the opposite direction. Mam's coming and I want to get off this rock.'\nHe stopped on the street, undecided. Concealed in shadows, he saw three figures emerge from a building directly ahead.\n\"That oughta do 'em 'til the next load,\" one of the men said.\n\"Don't count on it. Neither of them're ever satisfied,\" the second, largest man said.\n\"Just be glad they goes for the small ones, Loor, and not big hulkin' types like you.\"\nLaughing, the three men vanished into the night.\nErik stared after them, gaping. It seemed incredible--a wild leap in logic. Could he have stumbled on the secret entrance to the Blue Cushion?\nHe was already inside before consciously deciding to move.\nSweaty, tired, and filthy, Erik Milhollin emerged from the tunnel in an underground bathing room. A communal shower area formed one side; the floors and walls still glistened with moisture. Discarded clothing for small bodies littered the tiles.\nHe heard the screaming from several deserted corridors away. A deep keening noise, accompanied by the fluting cries of terrified children. It took several moments to attach a name to the masculine shrieks.\n`God help him, they caught Regon.'\nErik approached the area with caution. He would do no one, least of all Regon, any good if he got himself caught as well.\nErik crouched near the door beyond which the sounds came. Regon broke his cries of pain with curses aimed at his tormenters. Erik smiled at the man's spirit; even nearly insane from the abuse, Regon's metaphors were colorful and extremely descriptive.\nChildren's weeping and two men's laughter occasionally drowned out Regon's weakening cries.\n`I can't just go barging in unarmed,' he reasoned. `They'd cut me to pieces. So what can I do? I'm a space nav. I know electronics and computers. I know guidance and propulsion systems... That's it. Yes, it just might work!\nHang on, Regon, just a few minutes more.'\nErik moved down the hall, searching.\nSuspended between heaven and hell, Regon listened while his torturers laughed at his feeble yips. Hatred burned hot in his soul but had no outlet. Impotent with fury, blinded by unending agony, he yearned for five seconds' freedom--five seconds to break that fat Polliwog's neck.\nHis entire body throbbed, one mass knot of suffering. They hadn't done anything serious to him, yet already he ached for it to end. Brand's drug pumped through his system, magnifying the least little hurt until he thought he would die of it.\n\"What the--?\"\nRegon pried open pain-swollen eyes and forced his vision to steady.\nA curly-haired apparition stood in the doorway. `Erik?'\n\"Am I interrupting something?\"\nThe familiar voice, lilting with hard irony, echoed in Regon's ears. The pain, though no less, became more bearable.\n\"Who are you?\" Brand demanded. \"How did you get in here?\"\n\"It was quite simple, really. Y'see, dear Keishie gave me up in favor of a slinky little blond lump, so I thought I'd see what fun I could find someplace else.\"\n\"How did you got past all my security?\"\n\"I just walked right through the wall.\"\n\"Well, you'll never walk out through it.\"\nRegon want to call a warning, tried with all his waning strength. Brand would be dangerous to Erik all by himself. With Sorin's help, he would be unbeatable. What madness had prompted Erik to walk in here unarmed?\nRegon's first thought was that his complete loss of vision was due to impending unconsciousness. Brand's gutter oath and Sorin's shout indicated otherwise.\nChildren howled into the blackness. Brand and Sorin yelled. Erik Milhollin said nothing, and Regon waited.\nHis first sight of Regon suspended in the air, body covered in a shiny sheen of sweat, red welts and thin cuts marring him from cheek to ankle, drove Erik Milhollin very near the edge of reason. Sight of the children inside the cages did noth\ning to stabilize his composure.\nThough the majority of his attention stayed with Brand and Sorin, a small part was on Regon. Comprehension dawned on the pinched face, a quick flash of relief, quickly followed by anxiety.\nA light touch to the control in the palm of his hand plunged the room into utter, complete blackness. He'd already placed every item of furniture and flesh in his mind, and had no trouble finding Sorin in the vital first seconds.\nThe Polgishin croaked when Erik's hard fist slammed into his rolling midsection. Erik followed up with a left hook that sent the blind Polliwog flying.\nErik placed Brand by the rustle of the man's heavy clothing. He was careful to remember the table that held them apart. Skirting the obstacle, he met Brand as the larger man did likewise.\nErik moved with a spaceman's grace in the utter absence of light. The loud swish of cloth gave ample warning. He ducked under the blow and landed a kick square on Brand's most tender portion.\nBrand stumbled back into the table, groaning his agony.\nErik kicked out again, catching Brand alongside the head. The larger man lashed out with his arm. Caught above the left ear, he staggered back, seeing bright lights where he knew there should be utter blackness.\nErik ignored the peculiar ringing in his ears and halted his uncontrolled retreat when his back collided with something soft and yielding.\nRegon's shudder and deep groan explained the contact, and set his place in the mental room map. Erik met Brand as the larger man stumbled around in search of him.\nThe sound of Regon's agony, the sensed pain ringing along Erik's nerves, angered Erik beyond reason. He lashed out with a dirty kick, aimed shoulder high. Calculated and deliberate, it landed precisely where he wanted it to land.\nHe barely heard the wet crunch over the noises of the children. Brand made funny little choking sounds before he fell to the floor. The rustles, the soft gagging noises, quickly ceased.\nErik's every sense strained to find Sorin, but he could feel no sign of the other man. A moment's search found the control where he'd dropped it beside the door.\n\"I'm about to turn the lights back on. Close your eyes,\" he said, first in Terran Standard then in Krinoshin, for the benefit of the children, and switched on the lights.\nAfter the terrible gagging noises and the eternal silence that followed, Erik's voice made Regon go weak with relief. So relieved was he, he didn't obey Erik's command in time to keep from being dazzled by the sudden flood of bright illumination.\nHis first clear sight was of Brand stretched out on the floor a few feet away, throat crushed, face covered in blood. His second was of Erik beside the door, looking both ways along the outer corridor.\n\"He got away,\" Erik groused even as he came back and activated the winch that lowered Regon to the floor.\nRegon tried hard not to flinch at his friend's considerate touch, but even the brush of air along the fine hairs of his arms and chest was an individual agony. He could not help but quiver when Erik tried to comfort him with an arm across his back.\n\"No, don't touch ... drug ... sensitized skin ... hurts to touch.\"\nErik yanked his arm back. \"What can I do?\"\n\"Nothing ... has to wear off. I'm cold but I think I'd die if I tried to cover up. The children. Do what you can.\"\n\"Where's your communit?\"\n\"Dunno. They skinned me while I was unconscious.\" Regon was too busy trying to lessen the painful contact with the floor to give much thought to his missing clothing.\nErik hunted the chamber until he found Regon's things piled on top the table. Digging through the pouch, he found Regon's communit and moved back to the traumatized man. Gaining instruction on how to contact the surveilling team, he quickly placed the call and gave directions on how to find the secret entrance. Assured that help was forthcoming, Erik rooted through Brand's pockets until he found the activation chip for the children's cells. Freeing them was the work of a moment. Calming them down was another matter entirely.\nHe finally enlisted aid of the three oldest, calmest children and put them in charge of soothing the others. One Human child, a boy with red curls and green eyes, even managed a pale grin before turning to coo comfort to a tiny Jumoospin cubling.\nAs it happened, a Jumoospin female was first through the door. The cubling took one look at her, yipped in hysterical delight, and ran to bury her tiny muzzle in the fur of the adult's chest.\nTwo of the other children showed signs of renewed terror, but the rest were curiously drawn toward the gigantic Jumoospin female.\nLeaving her to calm the distressed younglings, Erik turned back in time to prevent two strangers from touching Regon's oversensitive flesh.\nOne of the men, a grey-skinned Krinoshin with a medical tattoo on his forehead, looked to Regon and asked, \"Do you know what they gave you?\"\n\"Jupiin. Dunno the dose.\"\n\"Doesn't matter. It's one of the more harmless sensitizers. Nothing to it, really.\"\nRegon favored the medical man with an irony-tinged eyebrow; blue eyes danced with pained mischief.\n\"If you say so. Allsi, you can be a right pain in the butt sometimes, you know that?\"\n\"If you thud and blunder boys will shoot across the galaxy in search of new and interesting ways to cause yourselves pain then look to me to set you right again, can I help it if I take refuge in wit?\"\n\"Taking refuge is one thing,\" Regon gritted his teeth and endured the physician's examination, \"murdering the poor thing is ... something else ... dammit, Allsi, that hurts!\"\n\"Regon ...\"\nErik's soft, submissive voice distracted Regon from his discomforts. Green eyes glittered in the light.\n\"Erik? You alright?\"\n\"Sorin got away. I'm sorry. I wanted to get him for you, but ...\"\nThough the chance to achieve a longed-for revenge was gone, Regon could not hold down a grin.\n\"There'll be other times.\"\n\"Least we got this lot free in time,\" Erik sighed, smiling at the drape of youn\nglings draping to the ursinoid from shoulder to ankle.\n\"There's that,\" Regon agreed. \"I just wiiiiiIII--Shiii--!\"\nRegon yelped as Allsi pressed an injector tube against his right hip. Milhollin's warm laughter followed him into healing sleep.\nVicki L.

ORLANDO, Captain Pappas commanding To: Current U.N.C.O. administrators Sirs, By the time you read this, I will have been dead for fifty years. Perhaps I should have put that first sentence another way. As soon as I finish this message, I will take the Captain's skiff and enter the atmosphere without power. By doing this, I hope that I will die. If, by some miracle, I survive, it shall not be for long. The planet you sent us to will kill me, and, even though this has the outward appearance of a suicide, I will believe to the end that it is not. It is murder. You killed us. This planet you sent us to will kill us all, in time. I believe that this will be yet another colony whose name will be engraved in stone on a monument in Berne, one line of barren inscription to mark the passing, fifty years ago, of twenty thousand men and women. If you have any questions as to why I say this, I suggest you look at the information that accompanies this message. Human life cannot survive on a planet where the deserts are larger than the oceans, where the icecaps are larger than the deserts, and the food algae won't grow. We will die of thirst, and if we don't die of thirst, we will die of cold, and if not cold, starvation, and if, through some wild chance, or through intercession by a sadistic God, we do not starve to death, we will surely die when the technology taken from the Orlando wears out. In agreeing to captain the Orlando, I took responsibility for the twenty thousand people on board. I still have that responsibility, but I haven't the power to help them. It was my responsibility. I abdicate it. I now lay the blame at your door, and I hope that at least one of the men who sent us here is still alive to hear what his decision did to us. I am going now, to die on the planet below. I always wanted to be buried at my home in Greece, but if I cannot have that, then I will at least die in a place with the right name. I will still die on Thessaly. Captain N. J. Pappas 1\/67 Thessaly Standard Date\nThe first thing I heard when I woke up that morning was an explosion. So was the second, and the third. Dull, flat explosions, their sounds muffled by the dust and distance around the Rock. I couldn't see anything, but since I was still in my duster's tent, that made a lot of sense. You can't see much when you're in a little canvas tube that you covered with dust the night before. So, I crawled out of my tent, and kicked it until it collapsed. I'd set it up again at night, but I couldn't leave it up because of the dayhiders. The dayhiders around the Rock are bigger, meaner, and more poisonous than the ones that wander into houses near Celton. Their front four legs have stingers, not just the front two, and they don't run away from humans. They fight back if the human wants his tent back, and nine times out of ten, the human doesn't win.\nI hate dayhiders.\nAnyway, I picked up my issues, and shook them to get rid of all the little nasties that crawl in clothes at night. No nasties fell out, so I pulled them on. If no bug wanted to sleep in my issues, that was fine with me. My climbing rig was just a cow leather vest with about twenty pounds of climbing spikes hung on it, so I didn't need to shake it too hard. I slung that over my shoulder, and went to eat.\nThe explosions continued, but I knew that sound...those were Celton ballista rounds, little rockets with compressed fireweed oil in their tips. The ballistas fire them twenty at a time, and they make big, hollow explosions when they hit.\nThe chow line was behind the bombshield, the big net hung between the Rock and the main camp, and I walked around it, looking around for anyone else that I might want to eat with. That is, anybody who might have some news about what was going on, and why we were here, and all that. But nobody but the usual boring crew was in the mess pit, so I grabbed a loaf of peelbread and a bottle of water, and sat down (I really wanted a beef sandwich, but beef was too expensive to give to people in Service.) I still ate better then than I ever had at home, but the time the Servicegroup had been in Celton had given me some expensive tastes. Like cow beef. Cows didn't live anywhere except right along the Sea. There was land near the Ocean where people thought they could live, but nobody had ever managed to get a cow across the Dust. And so, there were maybe ten thousand cows on Thessaly, along with maybe another ten thousand sheep, and I don't know how many tens of thousands of camels, and I can't eat camel beef. So, most of my pay that doesn't go home goes to monthly trips to the beef house, when I'm in Celton (when I'm in the field, it all goes home.)\nAfter I finished the dry peelbread, I stood up and wandered over to where the captain was. I wouldn't have done it in town, but in the Dust things get a little less formal. And, besides, my watch wasn't for another four hours. I looked at the captain, a tall, fat man with the sort of build that makes you think that there's a skinny man inside trying to get out. His issues' sleeves were pushed back, and he was staring at the base of the Rock. I sat down and looked where he was looking.\nThe ballistamen were pinned down right at the base of the Rock, and they couldn't get their gear set up, much less do any good up there. The Landingers were dug in far enough back that the ballistas couldn't get a good angle, and they were tossing boomite bottles over the lip every time the explosions stopped.\nWhich meant one thing.\nI knew what it meant, so I sat there looking like I didn't know what it meant, in the hopes that the captain wouldn't notice that I knew. Right. Whatever I say.\n\"Macklamore, get your scrawny duster butt up that rock. Now.\" The captain was a career Serviceman, muscles gone almost to fat, sloppy in a dirty gray shipsuit, but that didn't make him blind.\nThere I was, sitting down right next to the captain, on a pile of rope, making little jingling noises with my climbing spikes every time I breathed, and I was hoping he wouldn't remember the fact that I was the only duster in the watch who knew how to climb Ayers Rock.\nLike I said before: Right. Whatever.\nI stood up. The captain looked at me, looked up the sheer sides of the Rock, and turned his attention back to getting the ballistamen out of danger. He knew that if I didn't go up the Rock, he'd shoot me himself. And since he knew that I knew that, he didn't have to watch me.\nThe captain is smarter than he looks.\nAnyway, I started picking up the ropes and the chunkers and the sliders, and tried to spot a way up the Rock that the Landingers weren't covering.\nThat's not true.\nI stood there and looked at the Rock.\nThe Rock is funny, there's nothing like it for klicks and klicks to either side on the coastline, and there's a wide plain behind it full of morons and not much else inland, but there it sits. Six hundred meters tall. Six hundred meters wide, too, which makes it look like half of a pair of craps from the right angle. The damn thing is flat on top, with a little pit perfect to store food in, and it's got total arty coverage of the entire western march down to Port Landing, if you can get a catapult up there. Best damn layout on Thessaly, and the Landingers got to it first. And since the western march is five days shorter than the east march, we've got to go to town this way.\nBut we can't without taking out the Landingers on Ayers Rock.\nI grew up on a little island near here, so I'm not a duster by birth, but since earth fish don't hang out near the old homestead, my family had to come in past the Rock about every month to hunt, if we wanted to eat. If we wanted good food, we had to climb the Rock, to get at the earthbirds that nested on top. After Jerm took the dive off of it, I had to climb the Rock for the family. (Jerm was my brother.) I hadn't been back since I'd joined the Service.\nWhich makes these homecoming memories kind of out of place.\nThe Landingers were dropping their bombs with the fuses cut to go at like ten meters off the ground, and since they were wrapping the bombs in glass, it was really ripping into the ballistamen. They couldn't retreat, they couldn't go forward carrying their tubes.\nFine. Fine and dandy. I had to figure out a way to climb the damn Rock without getting my ass nailed in the first fifteen meters.\nThere was the old creek bed on the inland side of the Rock, that got you pretty close to the base...but the Landingers weren't stupid. They had to have someone watching it.\nDidn't they?\nI couldn't figure out anything better to try. Might as well give that a go. If I bit dust, then I bit dust. So what. I picked up the last of my ropes, grabbed my autoslot,and trotted off around the Rock.\nI stopped off at the ammo dump. Grench was there, sitting on top of a pile of slotter ammo crates and whittling away at a bolt for a roper. He looked just like he always did, sleeveless Service shirt, dull gray after a week in the Dust, wide ripper-leather belt with more knives and ammo slung than I usually carry into a slotfest, and looking half-asleep. I knew it was all a cover. He liked being the quartermaster, so he never looked like he gave a damn about it. If they knew he liked it there, they'd move him out, because anyone who likes being quartermaster is probably selling half of his inventory to the highest bidder. So, they left him there. Smarter than he looks, our Grench.\n\"Grench!\" I said. \"The captain says I gotta go talk with the Landites upstairs. Can I snag a rack of ballista?\"\n\"All the ballista ammo is over with the tubes.\" Grench said, never even looking at me. Right next to the pile he was sitting on was a siege roper, the big sort they use to put a fireweed net over a wall. Nine tubes were full. The one left was primed, without a bolt, and it was aimed at the top of the Rock. I looked at Grench a little more closely. He was staring at the top of the Rock, too.\n\"Grench, you can't torch the Rock!\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"You'll fry the ballistamen!\"\n\"Only if they're alive to fry. If they're dead, I don't need to worry.\" Grench wasn't much for honoring the dead. And Grench didn't like Port Landing much. And Grench really didn't like Landingers. I don't know why. Grench won't tell, either.\n\"Okay, whatever. You don't have any ballista racks?\"\n\"Nope.\" Grench was in his 'I don't want to talk' mood. \"Fine. Got anything else explosive I could take?\"\n\"Um.\" He looked around, and pointed at a large box over to the side. \"You can take those.\"\n\"What are they?\" I'd never seen that box open.\n\"Ship rounds.\"\n\"Ship rounds. Great. Fine.\" Ship rounds weigh ten kilos apiece, and they go off on impact, scattering burning fireweed everywhere. No fuses. Built to make life on a ship impossible. Normally, they're fired from a ship's main cannon, so nine times out of ten the person popping one off won't see the explosion. So the armsmen make them as big as they want to...one is supposed to be enough to cover an entire ship. I didn't want to think how far I could throw one, but I didn't want to bet I could throw one far enough. Even if I had to use them, I probably wouldn't survive it, but they were better than nothing. I broke open the box, and stared at the big, glass-slick cylinders that I was going to have to climb six hundred meters with. One slip, and either I went boom or half the Celton force did.\nI took two.\nThey fit in the canteen pockets on the back of my issue vest, but the flaps wouldn't button. Which wasn't a problem. If I was upside down, I was screwed up a moron's ass anyway, and I didn't figure on drinking much on the way up.\nThe last thing I did before hauling dust over to the creekbed was to look at where the ballistamen were down. The bombing had stopped, and the surviving ballistamen were cruising out of there like a banshee on homebrew. They'd left their tubes behind. I saw them running, about a half a klick or so away from where I was, they were almost to the bombshield. And then I saw a huge package tumble down the side of the Rock.\nSo did everyone else. As that thing bounced its way down to the ground, everyone dropped to the ground, or ran, or anything, away from anything that might explode.\nThey knew as well as I did that something that big had to be a fireweed bomb, and one that size could cover the whole encampment in fire. Those people who were behind the bombshield would be all right, but I wasn't going to put bets on anyone else's survival. Except mine. I was out of range. I had to be.\nI ducked behind a boulder anyway.\nThen the explosion came.\nI didn't feel anything hot anywhere near me, so I stood up.\nNone of the fireweed had landed anywhere near the bombshield, not much had landed on the slotter's line, and a whole big slab had landed on the ammo dump, and was burning merrily away. The whole face of the Rock was on fire, pretty much, and nobody was going to be getting anywhere near the tubes for a while.\nThe ammo dump. Grench.\nI ran a little ways back, but then I saw what had to be him, standing and watching the Rock, about thirty meters away from the dump. He wasn't running, so I knew that he hadn't loaded the charges into his roper, just the fireweed. Which meant that the ammo dump was gone. There's enough fireweed in a ten-barrel siege roper to keep it burning for days. If he'd loaded the charges, the charges would have cooked off and the fireweed would have gone everywhere, but it would have been scattered, and we might have been able to save some ammo.\nNo ammo meant that we were damned screwed. Each Serviceman had sixty slotter rounds, maybe ten bolts, and a grenade. That's all we had for the next three days. We were screwed.\nI turned back to the Rock.\nWe were screwed, unless I could climb the fucking Rock and dust the Landites. Nobody else we had on hand was a rock climber, much less a Rock climber. I couldn't take anyone with me, without both of us getting killed by me trying to shoot and shepherd a newby climber at the same time. If I did it right, we could take the top of the Rock and hold it until the rest of the troop came. If I didn't, they could hold it until their relief got here.\nI hate responsibility.\nThe creekbed was in sight, so I dropped and rolled in the dust, all over. I rubbed dust in my hair, over my ropes, my face. I spat and rubbed dust and spit on the metal gear. Then I ran like brickfield and jumped into the creek.\nThen I waited.\nNobody dropped a bomb on me, so I figured I hadn't been seen.\nThe creekbed was about two meters deep, mostly, maybe less, and dry as the Duster. Been a dry summer around here, I guessed. My folks were probably starving back home, they couldn't get a crop in, and now we were over here playing Serviceman on their hunting grounds.\nI ran towards the rock, keeping low. As I got nearer, I dropped further and further, until I was crawling at the very end.\nLooking up, I swung out of the creekbed, and ran right towards a little indentation in the Rock face. I looked up again. No Landinger faces looked back.\nOriginally, when I started writing this, I was going to tell everything, but now that I think about it, I'm going to skip over the climb. I can't really explain how I climb, or what happens during a climb. There's no space left in my head for memory, or thought, or anything. The world narrows down to me and the next handhold. Nothing else.\nNobody dropped anything on me, nobody shot at me. I made it to the top all right. I heard explosions on the other side of the Rock, but none near me. Anything else...well, the Rock is still there, and I've told you enough so you could probably find where I started. Go climb it yourself. If you want real fun, do it when someone's dropping a few hundred kilos of boomite near you.\nAt any rate, I pulled myself over the top, and looked around. It's a great feeling, unlike anything else on Thessaly, to actually stand on top of The Rock.\nBut I don't recommend it while there's a war on.\nThe top of the Rock looked just like it had last time I'd been there. Same birds, same rocks, same everything, except for a little tent, and three hungry-looking men watching me, two with slotters, one with his hands still on the crate that he had just emptied down onto the Celton force.\n\"Hi.\" I said, and dropped my slotter.\n\"You're a Celton.\" one of the ones with slotters said. This one had more of a uniform than the other two. His still had the sleeves. And if the Landingers used the same system we do, he was a sergeant. He looked like one, I guess. Older, balding, a little more heavy set than the other two.\n\"Right.\" I said.\n\"You came to kill us.\" said the one with the crate. He was young, maybe sixteen, and gaunt.\n\"Right again.\" I put my hands behind my head.\n\"With that?\" the sergeant said, pointing at my slotter on the ground.\n\"Nope,\" I said, moving my hands just a little.\n\"Then how?\" said the sergeant.\n\"With this.\" I said, and pulled one of the ship rounds up and over my head, and I'm sure I sprained my wrist doing it. I pulled the arming key. \"You shoot me, this drops, and the entire top of the Rock goes bye-bye. \"That won't do it.\" the sergeant said, not moving his slotter an inch from its aim right at my forehead.\n\"No, but the second one on my back, and the ballista rounds I've got in my pockets, will.\" I figured a little extra threat would help, even if I had to make it up. Actually, even with the second one, the blast wouldn't be that big. Big, yes, but if they managed to find cover, and there was a lot of it around, they could survive. But I hoped they were a little out of it. They looked hungry, and desperate, and if I offered a way for them to get out of this alive, maybe they'd take it.\n\"Josephi, Saunders, go stand over there. Behind those rocks.\" said the sergeant, and the other two went. Out of range. Damn. \"Look,\" he continued, to me this time, \"We can't let you move us. Now either you disarm that round or you and I go over the cliff together.\" He looked like he meant it, too. The factual type. I sighed.\n\"All right,\" I said and pushed the arming key back in. I hoped it clicked.\n\"Sit down,\" he said, pointing with his slotter.\nI sat.\n\"Now, we talk.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because I want to. Because I want to ask a real-live Celton a few questions. Because I want...\"\n\"I'm not a Celton.\" I interrupted.\n\"What?\" he looked confused.\n\"I'm not a Celton.\" I repeated.\n\"You're wearing Celton gear.\"\n\"So I work for them.\"\n\"That's a good enough reason to kill you.\"\n\"Fine. Go ahead, kill me.\"\nHe stopped, looked confused some more, opened his mouth, and then closed it again. He closed his eyes, and breathed in. Then he opened them again and said \"What are you, if you're not a Celton?\"\n\"I'm from a little town on the Styx, upriver from Detroit, but my family made a port on a little island about thirty klicks that way when I was little.\" I pointed out to sea.\n\"Then why'd you enlist?\" he asked.\n\"Enlist?\"\n\"You know, join up.\"\n\"Oh...Join the Service. Yeah. Well, my parents had four other kids to deal with, the earthlife fishing was off, and they could have used the bounty money. So I got it for them. Two years ago.\"\nHe paused. \"Do you know why you're invading?\"\nThis was a big change in conversation. \"No. I figure it's something stupid as always.\"\n\"Not this time.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"No. The last metsat report. There's a storm whipping up in the Dust, heading this way across Ocean.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"It's a really big storm. It'll pick up strength as it crosses Ocean. And they think that by the time it hits here, it'll be strong enough to break Ocean through to the Sea.\"\nI blinked. \"Ohhhhh damn. Brickfield and damn.\"\n\"That's right. The Celton earthfarms are between Ocean and the Sea. Once it breaks through, there won't be any food that a human can eat anywhere in Celton. Or Chunglyng. Or Dustsown. No food anywhere except Landing and Detroit and a few other minor ports. And we don't especially want to share.\"\n\"Why not?\" I wasn't pissed, I was just annoyed.\n\"Because our harvest is smaller than last year's, and last year we almost had food riots anyway. Before this is over, more than half of the people on Thessaly will have died of starvation.\"\n\"The...the fisheries?\"\n\"Some killed by the new water. Some eaten by new Thessalife. And the rest so dispersed that they probably won't be able to breed.\" He paused, looked up. \"I don't especially want my kids to starve, Serviceman.\"\n\"I don't want my family to starve either, muckhead.\"\n\"Nobody does. Nobody can win this war, and only about a third of us will survive it. Besides, this area of the Sea is under Landing control.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"Landing will try to send food to anyone they can...under Landing control. We can't try to feed everyone. We can try to feed our own.\"\nI just sat there for a while.\nThey hadn't told us. Any of us.\n\"Can't we do anything?\"\n\"We?\" he asked back.\n\"Celton.\"\n\"I don't know. I guess the Portmaster is probably doing everything he can, harvesting early, moving as many farms as he can. I don't think it'll be enough.\"\n\"No. Probably not.\"\nI stood, numbly, at the time not thinking about the slotter aimed at me. And then I walked over to the edge of the cliff, and looked towards home.\nI looked down, at the Servicemen I'd served with for a year.\nI looked back at the sergeant. This man could have surrendered before now, but he hadn't. He was still here, starving slowly. Surrendering isn't a problem, you just wait three months and then you're back at home. No problem.\nWe hadn't been told why we were invading this time, either. Normally, we get a big speech about why we need to invade, or why we have to defend against this invasion. Not this time. I looked north, towards Celton. It had to be my imagination, but I saw clouds on the horizon. Dark ones.\n\"How long?\" I asked, without turning around.\n\"Eight to ten days,\" the sergeant said.\nGrench would survive, I knew him, he would always survive, and he was the only Serviceman with whom I was friends. And if this man was telling the truth, I had to go tell my family, had to help, had to try and save what I could. I removed the other ship round from my vest, handed both to the sergeant. \"Here.\" I said. \"I don't have anything else. You can catch the birds here by putting out your water decontamination pills in little balls of bread. They explode, and they taste better than nothing.\"\n\"I've got to go home,\" I said.\nRob Furr is a senior at James Madison University in Virginia.

He was wearing a torn jacket made of some kind of animal, probably vat-grown horsehide. Anyone selling rabbit skins on a streetcorner in Osaka couldn't afford the genuine article.\n\"Out of my way,\" I said to him in Japanese, flashing my card. He immediately stepped back, probably out of fear that I might haul him in for soliciting. The cards in Osaka don't mention whether you're a detective or a cop, and that was fine with me -- it was a lot less trouble that way. Most of the scum in L.A. would see the neon-flashing \"Investigator\" as an invitation to either laugh or draw their weapons. Believe me, I preferred it when they laughed.\nAs I moved to enter the hotel, the rabbit-skin man immediately confronted Gehrig. I turned to explain that Gehrig was with me, and shouldn't be bothered, but Columbia Lou had already scared him away with one wave of his hand. I've always been envious of people who can do that.\n\"You think this is where he is?\" I asked Gehrig as the Kosami's smudged plastic doors slid open in front of us. The place smelled dirty -- I couldn't smell the local stink, but the cheap air freshener in the air let me know that it must have been fairly putrid.\n\"The place may have bright lights and moving doors, Ken, but it's still a cheap hotel. And no matter what century it is, there are only two places to look if you've lost Babe Ruth: bars and cheap hotels.\"\nThe Kosami was both. We made our way for the bar first.\nLaurie was there, of course. I had been to the bar at least fifty times since Matsushita transferred me to Osaka, and she was always there. The first ten times her appearance reassured me, reminded me of home. Then I was assigned to work with an American exec. I was astounded when I met her, because she looked nothing like Laurie. I guess I had begun to think that all American women looked like hookers -- and they don't, no matter what some of my Japanese friends say.\nAfter my experience with the American exec, I tried to forget all about Laurie. She was an American hooker, and that was all. No matter where you are in Japan, there are always expatriate Americans playing hooker both to company boys and to Japanese scum with credit to burn and a taste for the exotic.\n\"Hi, Kenny. Wanna taste of home?\" She licked her lips.\n\"No thanks, Laurie. I need to ask you if you've seen someone around here.\"\nI think she missed what I said entirely, mostly because she had already focused her attention on Lou.\n\"Well, who are you?\" she asked.\nYou've got to understand -- no matter what the bizarre surroundings, Lou Gehrig still looked like he had walked straight out of 1927. We had given him a modern suit, but the man radiated wholesomeness and purity. His manner made him seem like a prime target for Laurie: he was an American businessman or vacationer far from the States and ripe for some down-home pleasure.\nHe took of his hat -- he had insisted on wearing a hat, don't ask me why -- and nodded his head.\n\"My name's Lou Gehrig, ma'am. We're looking for a friend of mine named Babe Ruth.\"\nI pulled the picture I had of Ruth from my pocket and gave it to her. It had been taken the day before, during the first game of the Matsushita series. Ruth, wearing an official 1927 New York Yankees baseball uniform, was touching home plate. He had just homered off Catfish Hunter to defeat the Oakland Athletics, 6-5. After the game, Ruth disappeared. He never made it back to the team's hotel.\n\"He's a fat one, isn't he? I didn't know they let fatties like him play baseball.\"\n\"Mr. Ruth is good with the bat,\" I assured her.\n\"Yeah, that's what Shelly said.\" She handed the picture back to me.\n\"Shelly? The Marilyn Monroe model?\"\n\"Yeah, that's him. I can't believe that a recon job could be doing better business than me. Jesus, they took off his dick and moved his fat around a little, that's all. At least I'm fuckin' real. As advertised.\"\n\"Has Shelly seen Mr. Ruth?\"\n\"Seen him? She DID the piglet last night. Said she expected him to be exhausted after one round, but he kept comin' back, like a boxer.\"\n\"Where is she now?\"\n\"He\/she's upstairs with a client,\" Laurie said with contempt. \"A Jap. Little bastards never ask to see his birth certificate, so he takes 'em for full price. My fuckin' genes should be worth a little more, you know?\"\n\"What's the room number?\"\n\"1530. And be sure to scare the shit out of the John, so he asks for a refund. Serves Sheldon right.\"\nI thanked her, and Lou and I turned to go.\n\"Come back now, slugger,\" she said to Lou. This time, Lou didn't respond. Despite the 150-year gap, he DID know when to be polite to hookers and when to ignore them.\n\"Did she say that Shelly the hooker was a man?\" Lou asked as we entered the elevator.\n\"Yeah. Reconstructive surgery -- I guess some guys really have a thing about their dicks, and want 'em gone. Can you believe that? Lots of them end up as hookers, because it's a great way to reaffirm their newfound womanhood. They get tired of it after a while and end up doing something respectable, like being bartenders or marrying decrepit old men for their money.\"\n\"This is an incredible world you live in,\" Gehrig said, and shook his head.\n\"Not so incredible. There's the same sleaze as before. It's just different sleaze.\"\nI wasn't really talking to Lou Gehrig, of course, no more than the man that we were chasing was really George Herman Ruth. But they thought they were, and for all intents and purposes they acted just like their long-dead counterparts. I don't know the specifics of how they were created -- it involves artificial intelligence, chromosome matching, and lots of baseball nuts doing research into the history of the all-time great baseball teams.\nMatsushita, seeing as it owns half the National League and most of the teams in the Nippon League, decided to throw some of their money behind a \"greatest baseball series of all time\" event. So they set their technicians and research people at work on finding the eight greatest teams of all time, getting information on all their players, and creating exact replicas.\nAnd they did it. Last night, in the fifth game of the semifinal series, Babe Ruth -- or his ghost, replica, whatever you want to call it -- hit a home run to send the 1973 Oakland Athletics (most of whom weren't even born before Ruth had died) back into the ether from whence they came. Ain't science something?\n\"The woman we're going to meet looks exactly like Marilyn Monroe,\" I told Gehrig.\n\"Who?\"\n\"I'm sorry -- I thought you knew who she was. Some Yankee player ended up marrying her.\"\n\"Must've been after my time.\"\nThe elevator stopped on the fifteenth floor, and as the door opened we found ourselves looking right in Shelly's face.\n\"Shelly, we've got to talk.\"\n\"Shit,\" she said, and pulled something from her purse. It was money. \"Here, take three thousand. Just don't pull me in.\"\n\"Shelly, you know I'm no cop. And where the hell did you get money like this?\"\n\"All of Scarlett's girls have it on 'em, to make sure they don't get into any trouble with the cops.\"\nThe first time I had met Shelly, she had just been a cheap hooker, not much different from any other. But now she was working for Scarlett -- the den-mother-meets-madam who controlled half of the city's hookers and a good portion of its money. Being one of Scarlett's girls carried lots of perks -- including, it seemed, plenty of bribe money to keep the cops away.\n\"This gentleman and I need your help, Shelly. We're looking for this man.\" I took her hand, led her into the elevator, and showed her the picture of Ruth.\n\"Oh, him,\" she said, and rolled up her eyes. \"I figured he'd be an easy one, pay me for more than he could actually handle. But he didn't stop.\"\n\"When did you do business with him?\"\n\"Last night, around midnight. He came into the Kosami bar and we had a few drinks. Then we came upstairs.\"\n\"Did he say anything about where he was going after he left you?\"\nShe paused for a moment, pursing her lips in thought.\n\"It was three or four a.m., and the Kosami bar had closed for the night. He asked what else might be open that late, and I told him to head for American Street. Everything's open all night over there.\"\nThe door slid open, and we were back in the lobby. I thanked Shelly, and Lou and I headed for the door.\n\"You sure I wasn't the Yankee that married her?\" he asked me.\n\"Pretty sure.\" Gehrig knew his life's history up to 1927, but not beyond. To the Yankees, it seemed as if they had been sucked through a time machine -- they didn't even know that they were created beings. I'm sure Lou had spoken to other players from other eras as they stood on first base, next to him, but I didn't know if they had mentioned what happened to Lou Gehrig after 1927.\nIf I were one of those players, I certainly wouldn't have said anything. To this day, there's still a Lou Gehrig's Disease. There are still people who die slowly as they lose control of their bodies -- just like Gehrig did. I tried to picture the huge, incredibly strong man in front of me as a uncontrollable shaking pile of flesh, and couldn't do it.\n\"Let's go find him, so we can all get back to work,\" Gehrig said as we walked out the door. \"We've got to get ready for the Giants. The game's tomorrow, right?\"\n\"Yeah, tomorrow night.\" The beginning of the All-Time World Series. Great publicity for Matsushita Corporation -- the Corp. I had to discreetly find Babe by midnight, or the corp would send out a massive search team for him. Publicly admitting the loss of one of the ghost players wouldn't reflect well on my dear Corp, but Babe Ruth had to be there for the opening game. He was their star, the all-time best baseball player in the baseball series of the ages.\nThe Corp preferred that I find him quietly. And considering how well I knew American Street, I would have no problem doing just that. Or so I hoped.\nAmerican Street in Osaka is, well, a laugh. Which isn't to say that it isn't American -- in fact, I came here quite often, to try and remind myself of what home was really like.\nEvery time, it made it even clearer why I didn't miss home that much.\nThe American was a strip of fast food restaurants, movie theaters, cheap hotels, a sports memorabilia shop, a couple of soldier-of-fortune weapons stores -- and lots of Lizard Joints.\nLizard Joints were, economically, the glue that held the American together. They were incredibly popular to the Japanese. For them, seeing a Lizard show was the ultimate American experience, without actually going to America.\nI avoided them. My memories of growing up in the western United States included McDonald's, Hollywood movies, the occasional stay in a Holiday Inn, cheering on the local sports teams, and even occasional bursts of gunfire.\nBut I never -- not even ONCE -- went to a live show featuring songs like `My Way', `Night and Day', and The Candy Man'. Nor did I see any Elvis, Beatles, Michael Jackson, or any other oldies revival show. No singer crooning ditties while his gut stuck out over the cummerbund of his tuxedo.\nNobody at the Corp in Osaka could believe it, when I told them. \"You have to see it,\" they said. \"It's the best America has to offer!\"\nAnd they took me.\nI only learned two things from the trip to Sammy's Sinatra-riffic Sensation In The Heart of American Street. First, I discovered that it was up to me, New York, New York. About that same time, I learned that I would never go see a Lizard show again.\n\"We'll start with the bars,\" I told Gehrig. \"Hopefully we'll find him soon.\"\nI prayed that George Herman Ruth wasn't downing gin and tonics while swinging to the groove of `Feelings' as performed by the Jerry Vale Memorial Orchestra.\n\"You seen this guy?\" I asked Mark, owner of the aptly titled `Mark's American Bar'.\n\"Fat guy,\" Mark said in that funny accent of his.\n\"So you have seen him?\"\n\"Hell, you can tell from that picture that he's a fat guy. Look, Kenny, you know that information don't come without a price.\"\n\"Here's a thousand for your time,\" I said, and dropped the coins in his hand. \"Got any leads on him?\"\n\"You guys missed him by about three hours. He was here, all right -- first he got completely drunk, but then he got hold of some detox pills. Then he proceeded to get drunk all over again.\"\n\"Sounds like our man. Any idea where he went?\"\n\"Look, after he got drunk again, he started playing around with a couple of local girls. They're hookers, but your fat guy was trying to romance 'em or something.\"\n\"Was there trouble?\"\n\"Nah. They straightened him out. Guess he paid one of 'em, because they gave him some Randies and then headed for the door.\"\n\"Shit. So he bought Randies, and took off with a hooker. Right?\"\n\"Got it.\" He tapped his watch. \"Time's up.\"\n\"Look, thanks for your help. Can you call me if you see him again?\"\n\"No way,\" Mark said. \"The babes are Scarlett's. The Randies, too. The moment they walked out the door, it became Scarlett's territory. You know how protective she is of her preferred customers.\"\n\"You sure a few thousand wouldn't help you forget that fear?\"\n\"Not for that fat-ass, it wouldn't. Didn't much like the looks of him anyway.\"\nI gave Mark my best `Fuck You' smile. \"Let's get out of here,\" I said.\n\"I knew he wouldn't help us,\" Gehrig said as we headed for the door.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Didn't you hear the accent? He's from Brooklyn. They've always hated the Yankees.\"\nOutside the bar, he dropped his big right hand onto the top of my shoulder.\n\"Hold on a second,\" he said. \"Do you mind explaining what all that was about?\"\n\"What part didn't you get?\"\n\"Well, most of it. Being one of the Babe's teammates teaches you plenty about hookers and drinking, but... `Randies?' `detox?'\"\n\"Pills,\" I told him. \"Randies are heavy intoxicants, slightly psychedelic, that also increase sexual drive and potency. Kind of the best of all worlds. Detox pills are instant sober-ups. Babe probably took a Detox by mistake, and then popped some Randies to rectify the situation.\"\n\"What a world,\" Gehrig said, shaking his head. \"If we had those sober pills in the '20s, Babe might've hit 70 or 80 home runs a year.\"\n\"And if you had Randies in the '20s, Babe wouldn't have hit ANY--\"\nAnd then it hit me. Randies were no common street drug. Scarlett's girls had them because they went with the business. Randied-up Johns could still get it up. But, like Scarlett's girls, Randies cost large sums of money for even the smallest of doses.\nAnd none of the baseball players had carried any money.\n\"Oh, man,\" I said.\nGehrig looked puzzled.\n\"If I asked you to buy me a drink, could you?\" He shook his head.\n\"Of course not. I don't have a wallet -- hell, I feel naked without one.\"\n\"Right. So where has Babe gotten the money to pay for all the drinks, drugs, and hookers?\"\nI HAD hoped we could get him back before he had broken any laws. Now I just hoped we'd get him back before the skin of the world's greatest batsman was being peddled on an Osaka streetcorner.\nHome base for Scarlett and her girls was a mansion known as -I swear I'm not kidding -- Tara. And while the hookers didn't resemble any character in `Gone With the Wind', all of Scarlett's security people looked exactly like Rhett Butler -- or should I say Clark Gable.\n\"What do you want?\" one of the Gables at the door asked us.\n\"We need to see Scarlett,\" I told him. \"We're looking for a friend of ours.\"\n\"Scarlett's real busy,\" the Gable said. \"Who should we say is callin'?\"\n\"My name's Ken Nishi,\" I said. \"I'm looking for a man named Babe Ruth.\"\n\"Hold on,\" Gable Number One said, and went inside. Gehrig and I stood outside with the silent second Gable.\n\"This Scarlett has identical twin bodyguards?\" Gehrig asked me.\n\"Not quite. The one that just went in is almost two inches shorter than this one.\" Lou raised his eyebrows. \"I'm a detective. I notice this stuff.\"\n\"Are these bodyguards like that Shelly girl, then?\"\n\"The plumbing's different -- but otherwise, yes.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the first Gable as he emerged from the front door. \"Scarlet can't be disturbed right now. I suggest you call again tomorrow.\"\n\"Sir,\" Gehrig began, \"would you be so kind as to let us go inside and find our friend?\"\nThe Gable smiled widely. \"I'm sorry, friend -- but business is business. No visitors while work is in session.\"\nI turned away from the Gables and began walking down the steps that led down to street level.\n\"Come on, Lou,\" I said loudly. When we reached the street, I added: \"We'll be back. Let's go get us some hookers.\"\nWe found a couple of Scarlett's girls back at Mark's American -- the problem was getting them interested in us. Scarlett's trained her girls to be VERY selective about who they'll bring back to Tara. The first thing we had to do was make sure that the girls were first-string -- only the cream of the crop are based in Tara. The dregs, like Shelly, work at cheap hotels around town.\nAfter we found out that Sara and Viv were Scarlett's top-of-the line, we had to convince them that we had money. The first-string ladies are extremely expensive, and the purchase of a few Randies is also required.\nWe managed to pass our John Interview by showing them my credit card (with billions in Matsushita money backing it) and claiming to be two of the baseball players from the series. Sara bought Gehrig's story, mostly because he actually WAS what he claimed to be. As for me, well, I told Viv I was legendary Japanese slugger Saduharo Oh.\nI guess my credit was good enough that Viv wasn't going to question my veracity. I do look fairly Japanese, though about half my family is European-American -- but when it comes to my clothing, body language, and the way I talk, I'm about as UN-Japanese as you can get.\nAfter they took my money, they handed each of us two small green pills -- Randies. I turned to look at Gehrig, who was staring into the palm of his hand. He made a small gulping noise.\nI smiled at him and dry-swallowed the Randies. I have to give it to the guy -- he had a lot of guts. He imitated my actions as soon as I had finished swallowing.\nIt was a couple blocks to Tara, so we ended up walking there from Mark's. As I stepped out of the bar and onto the dirty sidewalks of the American, I felt the whole district slide around me. I could tell that the Randies were kicking in, though their psychedelic effects were mild compared to the drugs I'd taken in the past. And I wasn't really afraid of getting out of control -- if I needed it, I had a couple of detoxes in the bottom of my pocket and a gun hidden against the small of my back.\nThe randies also had an effect on my libido, and so I suddenly began to take more notice of Viv. She was reconstituted-gorgeous, every man's dream and a plastic surgeon's reality. Though I like to think of myself as a pretty good detective, I didn't know whether she was a natural male or female. Some people can take one look at a person's neck and figure out whether they've had their Adam's Apple removed or not.\nMy hand slid around her back and I could feel the curve of her hip underneath the strange material her clothes were made out of. It felt almost alive, more of a second skin than actual clothing. Then again, it could've just been the Randies talking.\nGehrig, meanwhile, was squeezing Sara's breasts and mumbling to himself. I didn't suppose the old boy had much experience with drugs like these, and the double-whammy of sexual drive and hallucinations had to be more powerful than anything that existed in Gehrig's time.\nI decided to let him enjoy it while it lasted.\nIt didn't take us very long to reach Tara. As we neared the front door, a skinseller approached us. It looked like the same one who had been in front of the Kosami earlier.\n\"Buy skin,\" he said. \"Real rabbit!\"\nThis time, under the influence of Randies, I was a bit nicer to the little man. Rather than ignoring him, I paused briefly to say hello to the cute bunny skin and pet it a little.\n\"Nice rabbit you've got there,\" I told the man. Then Viv pulled me away from him. It was time to enter Tara.\nI blinked as I looked up at the mansion's facade. It seemed incredibly huge, aristocratic, and completely out-of-place amidst the cheap neon and plastic crap that made up the rest of the American.\n\"My, my,\" I said, \"I do believe the south has risen again.\"\nWe went inside.\n\"Ready, slugger?\" Viv asked me. I have to admit, the Randies were certainly having an effect. I put my hands on her waist, and then slid them up to her breasts. From there, I moved them to on her cheeks, as I began kissing her. Then I slid one of my hands to the nape of her neck and gently stuck a sedative patch to it.\nTwenty seconds later, she was unconscious. Two minutes later, Gehrig and I had popped our detoxes and were searching room by room for Ruth.\nWe found the Sultan of Swat half-clothed and face down on a bed a few doors down from our rooms. One of Scarlett's girls was sitting on a chair in the corner, polishing her fingernails.\n\"What do you want?\" she asked. \"Can't you see I've got a customer?\"\n\"A busy one, too,\" Gehrig said.\n\"Look, Scarlett doesn't allow more than one client per girl. And I've got mine. So you'd better leave.\"\n\"He's a friend of ours,\" I told her. \"We've come to take him back home.\"\n\"Oh, no you don't,\" she said. \"He's paid up. I'm supposed to keep him here until he walks himself out.\"\n\"Who asked you to do that?\" I asked.\n\"Scarlett. She told me the fat guy had some big money behind him, and that I should try to get as much of it out of him as possible.\"\n\"So you'd keep him here, charging him for your services and for drugs until he finally left?\"\n\"Or until his money ran out, yeah. Why not?\"\n\"Like I said, sister... we've come to take him home.\" I nodded to Gehrig, who went over to the bed and began shaking Ruth awake.\n\"Stop it!\" the girl shouted. Before she could get protest too loudly, I walked over to her and slapped a sedative derm on her neck.\n\"Hey!\" she shouted. \"What the hell do you think you're doing? What's this fucking thing you stuck to me? What did you do to me? Help! I can' stan'up...\"\nScarlett's girl hit the ground, completely unconscious.\nBabe Ruth was slowly coming to, under the kind hand of Lou Gehrig.\n\"Come on, Babe... time to get up... got to get back before the next game,\" Gehrig said to the massive home-run king.\n\"You done this before?\" I asked Gehrig.\n\"Too many times to remember. Like I said, Ken... the time and place may have changed, but the Babe's still the same man and a whorehouse is still a whorehouse.\"\nGehrig and I pulled the Babe to his feet and began leading him out of Tara. We were about 10 feet from the back door when an alarm went off. I heard a woman screaming from upstairs -- it was Viv.\n\"He fuckin' knocked me out!\" she yelled.\nFour Clark Gables were suddenly running toward us, two from the front door and two more from the hallway that led to the rest of the building.\n\"Down!\" I yelled to Gehrig and the Babe, and we all fell to the ground. I pulled my gun, hoping that I could get all four of the Gables before they got us.\n\"Frankly, my dear,\" I said, pulled the trigger, and scored a direct hit on the head of Gable Number One. \"I don't-\" and Gable Two went down, \"give a-\" and Gable three went down, \"damn-\"\nAnd then Gable Number Four's gun shattered my pistol hand. The gun flew across the floor, but I didn't really notice. I was screaming so loud that I can't even remember being knocked out when the Gable kicked me in the head.\nWhen I woke up, I was in a Matsushita hospital bed. I obviously hadn't been killed by Scarlett -- in fact, she had turned me back over to the Corp.\nThere was nothing I could do during the next few days I lay in that hospital bed but stare at the TV -- so I watched the all-time world series in three dimensions. It was as exciting as the Corp had hoped it would be, and they no doubt made a killing on the entire affair. The series went to seven games, just as they had hoped. Maximizing profits was the key.\nI was amazed the series was that close -- I figured the Yankees would win in a cakewalk. But they were actually down three games to two going into game six. Just as the corp had hoped, the game ended dramatically -- Babe Ruth, looking just as healthy as he always seemed to look on those old-time movie reels, doubled off the top of the centerfield wall in the top of the ninth to score Lou Gehrig and put the Yankees ahead to stay. That hit sent the championship of all time to a seventh game. And to think that just a few days before, Gehrig and I were carrying a half-naked and stoned out of his mind Babe out of a local whorehouse.\nThe day of the seventh game, I finally found out how I had managed to come out of my adventure alive, and how Babe and Lou had managed to get back in order to play in the series.\nMy first visitor was a mid-range Matsushita executive named Mariko, and she sure didn't seem happy to see me. In fact, when she walked in the door and saw that I was conscious, she began to scowl. She also refused to make eye contact with me.\n\"Well, Nishi, at least you managed to get Ruth back without any bad publicity,\" she said.\nNo publicity? I had blown away three reincarnations of Rhett Butler in the middle of the biggest brothel in Osaka, and there had been no publicity?\n\"But you also cost the corporation a mint, almost all of it unauthorized. You paid for hookers and Randies for both yourself and your assistant, and we had to pay Scarlett the madame for all the services Ruth paid for while he was out.\"\n\"The Corp had to pay for that?\"\n\"Sure did. Scarlett knew that we were behind the series, and she knew perfectly well who their fat customer was. So they tried to wring as much money out of the corporation as possible.\"\n\"Well, I DID manage to limit how much time the Babe spent at Tara,\" I told her.\n\"True. But you also managed to kill two of her bodyguards and seriously wounded a third. We had to pay for his medical bills, plus yours. Scarlett also demanded a very large sum of money to keep it all away from the police.\"\n\"How large?\"\n\"Extremely large. That's all I'm allowed to say.\"\n\"Shit,\" I said. Once a Corp worker, always a Corp worker. Matsushita would never fire me -- they'd just move me to some ridiculous location like Antarctica and have me gutting fish and throwing their heads into a bucket.\n\"Don't worry about it. The corporation's got plenty of money, and we got Ruth back in time to have him play in the series. Nothing's going to happen to you, this time. Just don't let ANYTHING like this happen again.\"\nThat was all Mariko had to say. I never heard another word from the Corp about the incident.\nBut Mariko wasn't my only guest. When she left the room, Gehrig came in. Right behind him was Babe Ruth himself.\n\"You're looking a lot better, Ken,\" were the first words out of Gehrig's mouth.\n\"Yeah, lookin' real good,\" Ruth said.\n\"Thanks. Hey, good luck tonight.\"\nRuth smiled his famous dimpled, fat-cheeked smile.\n\"And thanks for pullin' me out of that dive the other day,\" Ruth said. \"I've got hold of some mean stuff in my time, but those pills really take the cake.\"\n\"Look, Ken,\" Gehrig started, \"we can't stay long. I practically had to beg on my knees before that Mariko woman agreed to bring us here. I just wanted to thank you for all you've done for us. You did a great job.\"\n\"It's the first time anyone's gotten shot up for me,\" Ruth said with a laugh. \"If there's anything I can do for you, just name it.\"\n\"One thing, Babe,\" I said. \"Hit one out for me tonight.\"\nHe smiled again. \"You got it, kid.\"\nWhoever made this Ruth character sure got the recipe right. Not only did they make him so well that he ran away from the team just for the sake of his vices, but even his heroic actions were dead-on. Ruth hit me a homer, all right. It won the series for the Yankees in the bottom of the ninth inning.\nThe next day, the simulations of the 1927 Yankees were sent back into the void from which they came. They were melted down or erased or whatever you do with computer simulations of real people.\nSo I had risked my life for these artificial people and the integrity of my corporation. And after all that, while I lay in a hospital bed, the people I had saved were wiped from existence. The only real souvenir I had of the whole event was my shattered hand.\nWell, I didn't just have the hand. The day after the series, as those players were being dispatched back into oblivion, a Matsushita courier brought me a special package. Inside was the winning baseball, signed by the real live Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig replicas.\nIt was enough for me.\nJason Snell is a senior at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Communication and minoring in Literature\/Writing.

Some are more frightening than\nothers.'\n--PHIL FOGLIO\n6012 Common Empire Year, Loord Empire, Planet Loord, Special Forces Center, 0700 hours.\n\"Are you absolutely sure about this man's qualifications, Major Durn?\" Third High Commander Noril inquired skeptically as the pair walked toward the barracks. \"You know I won't tolerate just any officer leading my troops in the field.\"\n\"I assure you, sir, Lieutenant Mongoe is a remarkable soldier. Some say he's the best to serve in Special Forces so far.\"\nNoril made a rumbling noise in the back of his throat. \"Maybe that's what people say, but I personally question his qualifications as well as your recommendation to put him in MY pet project. It was hard enough drumming up support for it, you know. I don't want any disasters.\"\n\"I'm afraid I fail to see the problem, sir.\"\nThe High Commander rapped the clipboard he held. \"Have you seen this man's records? They're absolutely atrocious!\"\n\"Atrocious?\" Durn replied, surprised. \"He went from third class private to sergeant major in an unbelievably record time, did well in officer's training, and has had a ninety-five percent success rate in his missions since he came to Special Forces eight years ago. He was a hero in the Qorant War. He's been decorated more times than I can count offhand.\"\n\"His military record isn't what I question.\"\n\"Then what is, sir?\"\nNoril curled his lip in distaste. \"The man dropped out of higher ed with mediocre grades to enlist in the Ground Forces. How the hell did he get sent to officer's training?\"\n\"He consistently showed the necessary traits required to be an officer.\"\n\"Did he? Does that include numerous curfew violations, disobeying orders, tardiness, and reckless use of military equipment?\"\n\"Mongoe is an... energetic young man,\" Durn explained. \"As for disobeying orders, `bending' is the more appropriate term. He likes to do things his way. The reason he gets away with it is because his way is usually better than his superiors' way--including mine.\"\n\"I see,\" Noril replied bluntly.\n\"As for the disappearance and destruction of several of our experimental hand-held particle acceleration beams, well, he's been disciplined, and they didn't work well anyway. A good portion of them melted themselves, which he can't be held accountible for. The project was scrapped a long time ago.\"\n\"Hm. I spent a little time today talking to some of your other lieutenants, and they don't seem to like him much at all. They say he's crude, profane, and tactless.\"\nDurn laughed. \"That's because he is, sir. But that's just him and where he comes from. He's a good man. The enlisted men love him. Usually there's a rift between them and the officers. You know, most of my lieutenants are upper class academy material. They're just not used to someone like Mongoe.\" The major stopped in front of the shower room. \"Here we are, sir.\"\nNoril narrowed his eyes. \"What are we doing here?\"\n\"You said you wanted to meet him casually, as a person, sir. His squad just got back in from training. They're probably just about ready to go to breakfast.\"\n\"Alright.\" Noril heaved a sigh. \"Let's go in.\"\nThe two officers quietly entered and stood unobtrusively and unnoticed as young men in various states of dress pulled on their boots or fumbled through lockers for uniforms. The sonic \"showers\" hummed in the background.\n\"Well,\" Noril said, \"Where is he?\"\nAs if in reply there came the sound of rowdy hoots and cheers from the cleaning area. All heads turned in the general direction. A group of soldiers ran out, most of them in towels, laughing their heads off as they looked on at some unseen commotion. Presently two men followed the group, or rather, one man had the other in a headlock and was dragging him along over the tiles.\nThird High Commander Noril scowled in distaste as he looked on. \"Enlisted rabble,\" he muttered.\n\"Argh!\" yelped the man in the headlock, attempting to twist free, \"I give up already!\"\n\"Too bad, pussy!\" his captor roared with delight. He was a huge man, average in height but very large in build, rippling with muscles. \"You lose, sucker! And you know what that means... !\"\n\"FLUSHIE!\" chorused all the other soldiers at once, \"FLUSHIE FLUSHIE FLUSHIE!!\"\nLaughing maniacally, the large man pulled his victim off to the right, out of sight. Soon after came another yell, cut off by the sound of a toilet flushing several times. The soldiers clapped and whistled. Even Major Durn chuckled. Noril seemed disgusted.\n\"I can't believe what I just saw,\" he grumbled. \"If this Mongoe person is so good with the men, why doesn't he stop this kind of immature behavior?\"\n\"Sir,\" Durn chuckled, \"That WAS Lieutenant Mongoe.\"\nNoril arched his eyebrows. \"Getting his head rammed in the toilet by one of his own troops?\"\n\"No... ramming one of his own troops' head in the toilet... sir.\"\nThe High Commander closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. \"I'm going to ask you again, Durn: How did this man get into officer's training?\"\n\"Despite what you just saw, he really is an intelligent man, sir.\"\n\"Considering his educational record--\"\n\"He claims he dropped out because it bored him, sir.\"\n\"I'll bet.\"\nDurn grew more serious. \"May I remind you, sir, that You sent up one of your own Space Navy personnel less than a week ago to assess the lieutenant? What was his name... that scrawny tactician from the Surefire incident... \"\n\"Keezor,\" Noril informed him.\n\"Oh, yes,\" the major muttered, \"Nervous, antisocial man... didn't like him... \" He cleared his throat. \"Anyway, I did speak to him after. He seemed impressed with Mongoe.\"\n\"He wrote `clever for a primate' in his report,\" Noril countered.\n\"Was that all he said?\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Was that all Keezor said about the lieutenant?\"\n\"Well, er... \" The High Commander exhaled sharply. \"I didn't read the whole report, to tell you the truth, Major.\"\n\"Maybe you should,\" Durn suggested. He did not seem pleased.\nNoril shrugged and scanned through the rest of the papers in his clipboard. \"Mmm... I.Q., eighty-seventh percentile... general tactical knowledge, eighty- ninth... specialized tactics, ninety-fourth... problem solving response time... \" His voice trailed off as he read the stats, then picked up again in a mumble. \"Subject clever for a primate... rather crude but by no means deficient in either mental or physical facilities... reccomend Lieutenant A. Mongoe for proposed position.\" Noril sighed and looked over at Mongoe, now joking with the others as he pulled on his clothes. \"I don't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going to give him a chance.\" He handed Durn a sealed envelope. \"I don't think I want to meet him personally anymore. Just brief him, and if he accepts the assignment, give him the envelope. His orders are in there.\"\n\"Will do, sir.\"\n\"Good. That will be all for now. I'll show myself out.\" Durn saluted, and Noril returned the gesture. The High Commander turned on his heel and walked away, wondering, `What makes me think I'll regret this?'\n2. S.C.U.M.\nBriefing room, Military Command, Imperial Grounds, Capital District, Loord; one week after Noril's previous decision.\n`Why?'\n`But why, Haezar? Why leave your ship for this? You're not a commando, for God's sake...'\n`Not a commando? Not a soldier. What is our son doing traipsing around in armor like that? You could have gone to the Diplomatic Corps after the Academy... You didn't have to go to Qorant for that stupid war.'\n`Mother...'\n`You worry me, Haezar. Don't do this.'\n`But--'\n`But what? It's dangerous! The last thing your mother and I need is to wonder if your even going to survive your next mission.'\n`It's not like that.'\n`It is! Being in the Navy's Elite Task Force is bad enough. What you're volunteering for is suicide!`\n`I don't want to listen to this anymore. I've already accepted. I can't march in to my commanding officer and say \"Sorry, but my parents won't let me!\" '\n`But Haezar--'\n`No more \"but\"s! I'm a grown man. I can take care of myself. Now leave me alone.'\nFirst Lieutenant Haezar Mozaq, common name Haezar, sighed as he played the previous night's argument over again in his head. He leaned back in his chair, waiting for the others to arrive. He was, as usual, more than punctual; he always made it a point to arrive at least five minutes early, no matter what the occasion. It gave him time to scope out his surroundings and assess his situation. It also gave him time to think.\n`Why? Why am I doing this? For me? For them?'\n`What am I trying to prove?'\n`I don't know.'\n`I'm nervous. I'm afraid.'\n`Of what? Screwing up? Falling short? Or just getting killed?'\n`I don't know.'\n`I'll find out.'\nThere came the murmuring of voices in the hall. Shortly after Third High Commander Noril entered the semi-dark room, chatting with another man. Haezar could see by the silhouette of the stranger's shoulder guards that he was a lieutenant commander.\nNoril turned up the lights, then flinched as the unexpected appearance of Haezar sitting slumped in a chair startled him.\nHaezar got to his feet and saluted. \"Sir,\" he said.\nNoril absently returned the salute. \"Sit down.\"\nHaezar sat as the High Commander took his own seat at the head of the table and began to ruffle through his papers. The stranger sat down across from Haezar. The lieutenant looked up at him for the first time.\nThe officer was, very bluntly, shockingly ugly, although not by Nature's decree. His face, long, narrow, and a bit sunken, was terribly marred and weathered. Knife scars streaked across his cheeks and neck, some clean, like artificial claw-marks, others crooked and warped. The most pronounced of these were one trench-like deformity which started at the right corner of his mouth and curved upward to the corner of his eye, and another which cut through his left eyebrow and ended on his cheek. The bridge of his nose bulged where it had been broken. The man also wore a narrow moustache, broken up by so many scars it seemed scraggly. But the officer's most astonishing feature, or at least the one which kept Haezar's attention, was his left eye. The iris was very pale, almost white toward the center, and appeared slightly misshapen. The pupil was off center, fixed to a small, hazy opening.\nThe lieutenant commander glanced briefly at Haezar and sneered. In actuality, Haezar realized after a moment, he had been sneering all along, and couldn't seem to help it. One of his numerous scars pulled at the upper left side of his mouth, exposing his teeth a bit, and another pulled his left nostril up at an angle. The entire effect, combined with the eye, was disturbing, if not frightening.\nThe stranger ran his right hand through his straight, longish hair. There was something not quite right about his fingers, or about the hand in general; the digits seemed crooked, the other bones slightly out of sync. The man looked up at Haezar again, froze for an instant, then lowered his head an stared at the table. He lost some of his posture. Haezar felt a tinge of guilt. Just before the man had lowered his head, the lieutenant's gaze met with his good eye. It had been oddly sad--pained, even.\nNoril cleared his throat and glanced at his watch. \"We're waiting for one more,\" he informed the pair, and muttered something about perpetual tardiness. The room fell silent.\nSeveral minutes passed. Suddenly there came the sound of heavy, hurried footsteps from the hall, and an instant later Lieutenant Mongoe came into the room. He mumbled an apology and flopped his sizeable bulk into the nearest chair. Haezar made a choking noise. Mongoe looked over in his direction, noticing him for the first time.\n\"Rich Boy!\" he exclaimed, somewhat sarcastic, smiling but not exactly pleasant.\n\"You!\" was all Haezar seemed able to reply. His stomach twisted into a knot.\n\"Oh, yes,\" Noril murmured, \"I forgot about Qorant. I believe you two have had the pleasure--\"\n\"--Experience,\" Mongoe growled, staring intensely at Haezar.\n\"--of working together,\" the High Commander concluded. He collected himself. \"Well, then, as long as we're all here, we might as well get started.\" He motioned to the stranger. \"This is Lieutenant Commander Quarq, Space Navy Elite Task Force, Third Division. Quarq, this is Lieutenant Haezar, Task Force, Second Division, and Lieutenant Mongoe from the Ground Forces' Special Forces, Twenty-Second Squadron.\"\nMongoe eyed Quarq with a touch of admiration. He had heard of the man--Devil's Eye, they called him--one of the most clever, daring, up-and-coming command officers in the Space Navy fleet. He could not wait to get to know the man, to swap stories, to ask him how he had earned his scars.\n\"The reason you are here, gentlemen,\" Noril went on, \"is because you have volunteered for what your orders described as `a specialized task force consisting of personnel from the various branches of the Loord military.' Exactly what this is is my current project, an experiment called Select Commandoes from United Militaries.\"\n(\"SCUM?\" Mongoe murmured with a wry smile.)\n\"The idea,\" Noril went on, \"is to bring together the finest of our servicemen--the elite of the elite--to tackle the most difficult assignments, both open and covert. The three of you have been chosen to lead the first trial squadron on an actual mission. Since the group has just been formed and there won't be much time to train, I've selected a delicate but not exceptionally difficult situation to use as a proving ground. But then,\" he added challengingly, \"people like you shouldn't need as much time to prepare.\"\n(\"Hah,\" Mongoe sneered quietly.)\n\"I expect results,\" Noril informed the threesome sternly. \"Excellent results. As far as I'm concerned this project of mine has a lot of potential. I don't want my support yanked. Failure will not be tolerated. Is that understood?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Quarq and Haezar replied. Mongoe stared at the wall and said nothing.\n\"Good. Then I'll brief you on your mission.\" The High Commander passed a folder to each of the officers. \"Your assignment is off-world, which may make things tricky for some of you. In fact, you're going to Planet Neemohne, in the Eastern half of the Empire.\" Noril paused to note the others' expressions. Mongoe was now staring at him, his eyes bright with adventure and curiosity. Haezar seemed interested, and Quarq simply gazed at his hands, very silent and serious.\n\"Our world is... unfortunately unique in all the Empire,\" Noril went on, \"so going to any of our other planets may be a shock to you and your men. And, as you know, our Eastern brothers are very different from us, especially in culture. I expect you all--the whole squadron--to attend all briefing lectures as specified in the documents I've given you so you'll at least have an idea of what to expect. Most of these will we given on board your ship en route to Neemohne, so you won't have much time. I'm expecting you to keep your wits and adapt quickly.\"\n\"What we have here is a political problem in the Qol District of Neemohne. The Qols' leader is a political-religious figure called the Shaheer. The Shaheer isn't royalty; he or she is chosen by the Qol Loords' major religious body, and is then trained to govern.\"\n\"If the Shaheer has to be trained to govern,\" Haezar interjected, \"then what do the religious leaders base their choice on?\"\n\"That's the interesting part. In reality, the religious leaders--the Dyjins--don't choose. They just select candidates. In the end, the Alat chooses.\"\n\"Who's the Alat?\"\n\"Not who--what. The Alat's a crystal.\"\nMongoe snorted in laughter.\n\"The Qols take this very seriously,\" Noril explained. \"They claim the crystal has certain powers and mystical properties. The Shaheer is supposedly the one who can best channel his or her mental energy through the Alat.\"\nMongoe chuckled. \"Hah. What a load... \"\nNoril shot him a look. \"Be quiet, Lieutenant. I didn't call you here to laugh. You can be skeptical on your own time.\" He paused, then went on. \"Right now the Shaheer is young--young enough to be vulnerable. The Dyjins believe that the man who ranked second to the current Shaheer in ability to use the Alat, a very rich upperclassman called Zyal, has been plotting the discreet assassination of the Shaheer. If the current Shaheer dies, then he, as second best, comes to power. There have also been numerous attempts to steal the Alat, but no one's been caught alive to question. Zyal is very influential. He has a lot of connections. We're not sure if he's been sending third parties to steal the Alat and plot assassinations, but then, we're not sure if he's involved at all, even though everyone would like to assume so.\"\n\"The Shaheer is important to us politically because for many years the Qol have provided us with certain rare elements found only in the Qol District--and a good portion of those are used in the military. We've always maintained good relations with the Qol government and the Shaheer. Zyal, however, is a radical, and a very strong one. If he becomes the Shaheer chances are he'll cut off or worsen relations with us, and no one will be able to successfully challenge him. That's the last thing the Emperor wants at this time. Our relations with the East are a bit shaky already.\"\n\"Your job is to protect the Shaheer at all costs until the crisis blows over, and to track down and deal with whoever's behind the problems, whether it's Zyal or not. The Shaheer's forces and investigative agents will help you. Specifics are detailed in the documents I gave you. You'll meet the rest of your squadron tomorrow, and leave for Neemohne the day after that. The three of you are to report to my office at 0700 sharp tomorrow. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the three officers replied.\n\"Good. Dismissed.\"\n3. Room and Board\nEastern Loord Empire, Planet Neemohne, Qol District, several weeks later.\nEven with the numerous briefings behind them, Neemohne turned out to be a shock for most of the S.C.U.M. squadron.\nThe unfortunate reality was that for many years Loord, the homeworld and head of the Empire, had been decaying, in part from age, but mostly due to a transient sun which had settled itself too close. Fifty years before, the new star--or the \"Rouge\", as it was popularly known--had appeared, and ten years after that the population which had chosen or had been forced to remain on the planet--a good ninety percent of the people--had moved into underground cities. Since the government did not want to further depress an already unstable populous, talk about what the world had been and about other worlds in general had been kept to a minimum. In the schools, ecology and zoology courses all but vanished. The net result was two generations of people to whom grass and trees and swimming were myths, and to whom \"sky\" was a vague concept at best.\nThe majority of the unit was forced, at least initially, to shade their eyes from the brightness of the sun with sunglasses, a curious and awkward experience for most. As a general rule, the S.C.U.M. personnel from the Space Navy fared a bit better; most of them had been to other planets, even if only briefly to touch down for refueling and supplies. Of them all, Haezar and Quarq had the most experience with other worlds, but even Quarq seemed ill at ease. Only Haezar appeared casual and uninterested as the others gawked after landing at a local Qol military base.\n\"Are you that untouched by the beauty?\" Quarq asked him quietly. He seemed to be making an attempt to form his twisted lips into a smile. He was failing miserably.\nHaezar hesitated for a moment, not quite sure if the man was being sarcastic or serious. He tried to ignore the lieutenant commander's grimace after guessing the latter. \"Well,\" he replied, \"The base here is nothing. Wait 'til you see the city.\"\n\"You've been here before?\"\n\"Oh, yeah. My father's an ambassador. Senior Ambassador, really. He's on the High Council. He's been everywhere. So have I. He used to take the family with him.\"\nThe city, as Haezar had indicated, proved to be both stunning and fascinating. Like Eastern Loord culture as a whole, it was an unusual mix of modern and arcane. Glass paneled office buildings shared the same streets as ornate stone and wood structures. Many of the roads still retained ancient cobblestones. Marble statues and fountains dotted the area. Just about everything was decorated to the hilt; stone and wood were polished and amazingly carved, glass was etched, and clothing was brocaded. Most of the men, and many women as well, wore swords and knives casually at their sides as they bragged about their hovercars and watched three- dimentional holo-televisions through storefront windows. The S.C.U.M. soldiers gaped and pointed all the way to their lodgings on the Shaheer's Grounds.\nOnce they had been settled in, Quarq, Mongoe and Haezar made their way across the Grounds to the palace to meet the Shaheer.\n\"Wow,\" Mongoe mumbled as he craned his head up at the shining spires and stained glass windows of the sprawling structure. \"Wow,\" he quietly exclaimed again when they were escorted inside. He spun in circles as he walked, taking in everything, all the time looking very stupid and muttering \"Wow\" over and over again, his mouth hanging open. Haezar seemed embarrassed by him, especially when the lieutenant uttered a rather excited \"Wo-o-o-o-w!\" when a liberally clad woman servant passed them in the hall.\n\"Be quiet!\" Haezar whispered sharply as they were led into an open, marble-floored hall. Their escort informed them that the Shaheer would arrive shortly and left them to wait.\nAfter a short time an impressive middle aged man clad in elaborately brocaded clothes and a black, velvety cloak strode into the room. At his side he wore shining scabbard, protruding from which was the jeweled hilt of a sword. He smiled as he approached the threesome. Again, Haezar seemed quite at ease while Quarq and Mongoe's faces registered a bit of nervousness.\nThe man was six and a half feet tall--slightly above average for an Eastern Loord--and made Quarq, who at just under six feet had always been considered tall, seem short in comparison. His skin tone was darker, and his eyes were slightly slanted. He was balding up top but the rest of his hair fell to his waist, neatly trimmed and accented by the occasional braid.\nThe newcomer held his hands out, open palms up. \"Good afternoon, warriors,\" he said in slightly accented Common. He made a circular motion with his hands. \"Welcome to Qol.\"\nThere was an awkward hesitation. Quarq found his voice. \"Thank you, Shaheer,\" he replied with a salute. \"I'm Lieutenant Commander Quarq. These are my immediate subordinates, Lieutenants Haezar and Mongoe.\"\nThe older man chuckled. \"I'm not the Shaheer, Commander. I am Hu-Jin, his Advisor.\"\n\"Uh--My apologies, sir.\"\n\"No need.\" Hu-Jin looked off to the side as another Loord came into the room. He was a small boy, perhaps nine or ten, wearing fairly simple clothing. The child came up to Hu-Jin and stood in front of him, looking up at the three soldiers. \"This is Dyan, our Shaheer,\" the Advisor informed them.\n\"But--\" Mongoe sputtered. Haezar discreetly elbowed him in the ribs.\nDyan, like Hu-Jin, held out his hands, palms up, and also made a circular motion. Unlike the older man's, however, it was an all-encompassing sweep.\n\"Welcome to my home,\" said the boy. \"You are free to go wherever you want and use any services and facilities we have.\"\n\"Th-thank you, Shaheer,\" Quarq replied, a bit surprised at how articulate the child was, and very surprised that the boy's face registered no revulsion or fright in reaction to his terrible appearance. Until now, the commander had had yet to meet a child who did not.\n\"Have you been fully briefed on the situation at hand?\" Hu-Jin asked. Quarq nodded. \"Good. As you can see, our Shaheer is too young to fully protect himself or the Alat. We've taken full security precautions ever since the first attempt to steal the Alat, but the thieves keep trying.\" The Advisor smiled in an unusual way which did not seem to fit his kindly features. The grin was wide, very pleased, and rather sadistic. \"Which essentially means,\" he went on, \"that they keep dying.\" His hand fondled the hilt of his sword. \"I dispatched two of them myself.\" The smile vanished and he sighed. \"We thought that the Shaheer's rival, Zyal, while angry and jealous, would not attempt to do any harm to our leader. But there were rumors and paranoia. We thought--and still think--that the thieves were sent by him. We believed he thought that if he had the Alat, he would have the power of the Shaheer. Unfortunately, assuming that the attempted thefts were directed by him, he must have grown tired of failure, because last week there was an assassination attempt on the Shaheer. Someone planted a bomb in the Shaheer's limousine, but a mechanic found it while doing some repair work.\n\"What we want from your unit for now is extra protection for the Shaheer. I currently have investigative agents out searching for clues and evidence. If we find out anything conclusive, namely that Zyal is responsible, we'll need your forces to move in and take him down.\" Hu-Jin paused awkwardly. \"If it is Zyal, and we can't bring him to justice by normal means, then the Shaheer can't move against him physically, and you'll be on your own.\"\n\"Why?\" Quarq asked. \"Our commanding officer led us to believe you would help us.\"\n\"We certainly will. But if you have to attack Zyal, the Shaheer's men cannot help. I'm surprised your superior didn't inform you. You see, the people who serve the Shaheer--all the people on the Grounds--are from a very special class. We are the Yuns, an ancient clan dedicated to the Shaheer. For centuries we had a rival clan, the Morin- shans, the renegades, so to speak, of the Qol people. Only a century ago, the Yuns and the Morin-shans made peace, but it's a tentative arrangement at best. Zyal is one of the most influential Morin-shans. If we move against him directly, the peace would be broken and there would be chaos.\"\n\"What about the other clans?\" Quarq inquired. \"Can't they help?\"\nHu-Jin clenched his jaw. \"There are no other clans among the Qol.\"\n\"What about help from other Districts?\"\n\"We tried that already. They all considered the situation too trite to pay attention to. That's why we looked to the Emperor, toward the West. That's why you're here.\"\n\"I see.\"\nAgain the Advisor sighed. \"The Shaheer and I have things to attend to now. The three of you are invited to stay here in the palace. I'll send someone to show you to your quarters. Tomorrow morning have your men assembled here for briefing and orientation. Until then, feel free to explore the palace, the Grounds, and the city, if you like, but please try not to cause any trouble, especially with one of the Morin-shans. You'll know them by the small, red diamond tattooed on their foreheads.\"\nQuarq frowned in thought. \"Were any of the thieves you killed Morin-shan?\"\n\"No. Zyal is not stupid. If he is behind this, he's imported someone else to do the job for him. I'm sure he'd rather take power without starting a war. Now, if you'll please excuse us... \" Hu-Jin led Dyan away.\n4. A Night Out on the Town\nSometime after dinner, the same day.\nMongoe was awed by his \"quarters\", the bedroom of which was considerably larger than his family's apartment, and whose high ceiling sported a huge skylight which allowed him to look up at the stars. The bathroom included a shower, sauna, and a whirlpool tub, all alien and fascinating to him. The situation on his homeworld had forced his people to carefully ration their use of water; the \"showers\" he knew were really chambers which misted one with cleanser, then took it, along with any sweat or grime, off via sonic cleaning methods.\nStill, after a couple of hours of examination, dinner, and relaxation, he grew restless. He changed into civilian clothes and went down the hall to Quarq's quarters. He found the officer sitting in the living room area reading a book.\n\"Hey,\" Mongoe greeted, \"What's up?\"\n\"Not much,\" Quarq replied, \"Why?\"\n\"I was thinkin'... Why don't we go out, have a drink, hunt for babes... ?\"\nQuarq shifted uncomfortably. \"Oh,\" he mumbled, \"I... I don't go out much... .\"\n\"Aw, c'mon! Let's have some fun. I wanna see the city.\"\n\"Well... alright.\" The lieutenant commander set down his book. \"Lemme change,\" he muttered, obviously unthrilled by Mongoe's proposals. \"I'll be ready in a minute.\"\nAs they walked out of the palace, Quarq was oddly silent. He stared at the floor as he walked.\n\"What's wrong?\" Mongoe asked.\n\"Nothing,\" the other muttered, then after a moment said, \"You've worked with Haezar before. What's he really like?\"\nMongoe grunted. \"Ah, he's okay, y'know, but he's a flake. Goes by the book too much. I dunno... maybe it's 'cause he's from a rich family. He's all proper and shit. I don't get why he's in the military. Hell, maybe his old man made him.\"\nThe pair left the Grounds and made their way into the city. Mongoe immediately headed for a nightclub, where he took a seat at the bar, followed by a reluctant Quarq, who sulkily kept his head hanging. Mongoe ordered drinks and began to chat with several attractive young women. Quarq said nothing. Another woman came up to the bar and sat down next to him.\n\"Hello, Westerner,\" she said, \"How do you like it way out here?\"\nQuarq lifted his head and looked at her. \"It's very nice here,\" he replied.\nThe woman stared at him. Her eyes widened briefly. She swallowed nervously and moved away without another word. Quarq shrank in his seat.\n\"What's wrong?\" Mongoe asked him, breaking from his own conversation.\n\"Ooh... friend of yours?\" one of the women he was speaking to asked. She and her companions leaned over to get a better look.\n\"Yeah,\" Mongoe told them. \"What's wrong, Quarq?\"\nQuarq shook his head and turned to Mongoe. \"Nothing,\" he replied, so quietly Mongoe could barely hear him over the music and conversation, \"I'm fine.\"\nThe women sitting on the other side of Mongoe blinked in surprise as they looked on. One quickly averted her eyes; another shuddered. The third simply stared. Quarq's eyes met hers and she looked away. The officer frowned and closed his eyes for a moment, then abruptly got up and left, coldly pushing his way through the crowd.\n\"Quarq?\" Mongoe inquired he watched him go.\n\"--so ugly!\" he heard one of the young women mutter.\n\"Hideous,\" another added.\nMongoe turned back to them. He stared at them hard, then curled his lip in distaste. \"Bitches,\" he growled, \"All of you.\" He got up and left the bar. He found Quarq standing alone outside. \"I'm sorry, man,\" he said. \"I didn't know--\"\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Quarq told him.\n\"Come on,\" Mongoe went on, \"Let's go find a good working-class bar, where guys go to get away from the babes, eh?\"\n\"Sure,\" the commander replied with a shrug. The pair set off in silence. After a time Quarq spoke up again. \"Mongoe,\" he said.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"You're a good man. You don't judge people.\"\nThe lieutenant laughed. \"The hell I don't! The difference between me and all those other assholes out there is, I know how to judge correctly.\"\nQuarq chuckled and attempted a smile which came out much more like a sneer. \"Right. Gotcha.\"\n\"Hey!\" someone called. Haezar jogged up to the pair from across the street. \"Where are you off to?\"\n\"To a good bar,\" Mongoe replied.\n\"Mind if I come with?\"\nThe lieutenant smiled. \"Isn't it past your bedtime, Rich Boy?\"\n\"Very funny, smartass.\"\n\"Ooh... \" Mongoe backed off in mock fear. \"I thought your mommy told you not to drink.\"\n\"I can drink you under the table, you ugly slab of meat.\"\n\"Hah! We'll see about that!\"\nThe trio made their way into a darker, more sinister section of the city. Haezar's distaste became more obvious with each passing block; he was in fact visibly relieved when Mongoe called a halt, announcing that he had found just the right place.\nHis relief turned to reservation as he looked the place over.\n\"Uh, Mongoe,\" he said, \"Something tells me this isn't a place of good repute.\"\n\"'S'okay,\" Mongoe replied, \"I'm not a man of good repute.\" Grinning mischievously, he went in. Quarq and Haezar followed.\nThe bar was run down, dark, and smokey. The tables were scarred, the chairs improperly balanced; the same could be said for most of the patrons. A large sign bearing the words \"NO DUELING\" hung over the bar. Most of the men present wore swords at their sides.\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Haezar asked Mongoe in a low voice.\n\"Sure I'm sure. It's the atmosphere that makes it good.\"\n\"People are staring at us.\"\n\"That's 'cause we're foreigners. Loosen up and stop gawking.\"\n\"Quarq looks like a choir boy next to some of these guys.\"\n\"Watch your mouth,\" Quarq growled.\nThe trio sat down at a table and ordered a pitcher of ale. Mongoe slugged it down with delight. Haezar sniffed at it, wrinkled his nose, then took a mouthful. He grimaced and spat it out.\n\"Haw, haw!\" one of the patrons cackled, \"Pretty foreigner boy can't hold his booze, eh?\"\nHaezar frowned. \"I can hold it fine, as long as it doesn't taste like it came out of the sewer.\"\nMongoe winced. \"Shut up!\" he hissed. \"I'm not gonna save your ass if you get it into trouble.\"\n\"I can take care of myself, thank you. Things have changed since we were in Qorant.\"\n\"Hey!\" the bartender called, \"You lowlifes insulting the house brew?!\"\nHaezar turned. \"You have anything more refined?\" he called back.\n\"Haezar, you stupid shithead!\" Mongoe growled.\nOne of the nearby patrons got up and swaggered up to Haezar. \"You're an insulting little shit, you know that? We don't like to be insulted.\"\n\"I wasn't talking to you,\" Haezar countered. Beside him, Mongoe sighed, closed his eyes, and shook his head.\n`How'd he ever get into the Elite Task Force?' he wondered.\n\"Ass-hole,\" the patron snarled, and sent his fist at Haezar's face. It never got there. With lightning speed, Quarq snapped his arm out and caught the man's fist inches away from Haezar's nose.\n\"Go away,\" he growled.\n\"Piss off, you ugly fucker,\" replied the patron. He made a fist with his free hand. Quarq altered his grip and squeezed. The patron yelped in pain. Quarq's lips parted fully into a frightening grimace-grin. He squeezed harder. The patron fell to his knees, groaning. \"Leggo!\" he grunted.\nQuarq let go and kicked him over. \"Go away,\" he repeated. The patron got up and left. Quarq looked around. The other patrons seemed amused. They looked back at him for a moment, then returned to their drinking.\nHaezar cleared his throat. \"Uh... thanks.\"\nA woman came to the table and sat down. Quarq immediately withdrew to an adjacent table. Haezar more or less ignored the new arrival, but Mongoe began to talk to her. After twenty minutes of friendly chatting, another patron, very large and not quite as drunk, stomped up to the table and clapped a hand on Mongoe's shoulder.\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" he asked.\nThe lieutenant looked up at him. \"Talkin' with the lady here. Got a problem with that?\"\n\"Yeah,\" the man replied, \"'Cause that's my woman you're making the moves on.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Really. I saw you touch her. Nobody touches my woman but me.\" The patron looked down at the woman. \"Come on. Get up.\"\n\"Go to hell,\" she replied, \"I'm just talking to him.\"\nThe man's eyes blazed with fury, not at the girl but at Mongoe. He stepped back. With a roar he shoved several tables out of the way. His hand went to the sword at his side. \"You offend me!\" he shouted. \"Humble yourself and apologize!\"\nMongoe looked him over, smiling sarcastically. \"Get lost.\"\n\"Uh, Mongoe--\" Haezar began.\nThe patron unsheathed his sword.\n\"Hey--can't you read?!\" the bartender snapped, tapping the \"NO DUELING\" sign. He was ignored. Everyone's attention was now locked on Mongoe and the irate patron.\n\"Isn't the bouncer going to stop this?\" Haezar asked a man a nearby table.\nThe man laughed. \"Kid, that IS the bouncer.\"\nHaezar swallowed hard. \"Mongoe,\" he went on quietly, \"The Eastern Loords take sword play very seriously. Back off. This guy'll kill you!\" His companion ignored him.\nThe patron began to twirl the sword in elaborate patterns: in front of him, to the side, in figure eights, over his head, and behind his back. His face was strained with anger. Mongoe looked on, amused and unimpressed. He walked over to the door and picked up the brick propping it open. He turned it over in his hands, smiling smugly as the angry patron continued to twirl his blade.\nHaezar's eyes widened. \"Mongoe, no! Wait--!\"\nMongoe wound up his arm in a fast underhand pitch and sent the brick into his antagonist's crotch.\n\"Glug!\" the patron sputtered, his eyes bugging out. The sword dropped from his limp hand. He collapsed on the floor.\n\"Yeah,\" Mongoe chuckled, but the bar fell dead silent.\n\"Mongoe,\" Haezar muttered frantically, \"That man was doing his opening--his challenge--with the sword. It's a ritual. It's bad etiquette--VERY bad etiquette to attack before both parties have completed their opening.\"\nOne by one, the patrons unsheathed their swords. All of them were glaring at Mongoe, and they weren't very pleased.\n\"Now you've done it,\" Haezar mumbled. He edged close to Mongoe. Quarq also pulled in toward them from his place off to the side.\n\"Back out the door slowly,\" he whispered to the pair. \"I don't want an incident.\"\n\"These jerks don't care what you want,\" Mongoe replied. He picked up a chair and held it out in front of him.\nThere was one final, awkward pause, and then with a collective cry the patrons surged forward, blades whirling. The three commandoes crowded back to back. Haezar and Quarq followed Mongoe's example and each picked up a chair.\nLaughing with delight, Mongoe caught the first of the blades with the chair and drove his free fist into its owner's face. On either side of him, his companions were busy fending off their own attackers.\n\"Back out!\" Quarq yelled.\n\"What, so soon?\" Mongoe replied. One of the patrons took advantage of his lapse in concentration and pommeled the large man in the face with the hilt of his sword. Mongoe staggered back, blood gushing from his nose, roaring in anger. He took hold of his chair with both hands and swept it through the space in front of him, taking down several more people.\nSirens sounded in the distance. Most of the bar customers froze.\n\"Police!\" someone yelled. An instant later the crowd ran forward in a human tidal wave and shoved Mongoe, Quarq and Haezar aside. They ran out the door and scattered into the night.\n\"Wait a minute!\" Mongoe exclaimed. He leaned out the door. \"Come back, you pussies!\" He paused, wiping the blood off his face. \"Damn,\" he muttered, \"That's the fourth time I've gotten my nose busted. I don't even remember what it used to look like.\"\n\"Shut the hell up,\" Quarq rumbled. He brushed past the lieutenant and grabbed his arm, dragging him out the door. Haezar quickly followed. The trio dodged out of sight just as the police pulled up to the bar.\n\"That was a stupid, dumbass thing you did back there!\" Quarq snapped at Mongoe as they headed back to the palace. \"You heard what Hu-Jin said: No incidents!\" His cold, pale eye fell on Haezar. \"And you too! Learn to behave right, dammit!\"\nQuarq's irritation, an unusual enough display for him, lingered on even after they returned to the Shaheer's Grounds. He went to his quarters, slamming the door behind him. Haezar sulkily returned to his own living space, leaving Mongoe alone and bored.\n\"Yer no fun,\" he muttered, \"Either of you.\" He glanced at his watch. As far as he was concerned, the night was still young. He went off to find something to do.\nSeveral hours later, it was Haezar's turn to be bored. Feeling restless inside, he went to Quarq's quarters and knocked on the door.\n\"Who is it?\" came the commander's voice from inside.\n\"It's Haezar.\"\nThere was a long pause, then, \"Come in.\" Haezar stepped inside. \"I'm in the bath,\" Quarq informed him. The lieutenant went in and found his superior sitting in the whirlpool tub, his head laid back against the tiles, eyes closed, his hair wet and limp from the steam. Haezar sat down on the floor on the opposite side of the tub.\n\"Well?\" Quarq said after a time without opening his eyes or looking up.\nHaezar shrugged. \"Uh... nothing, sir,\" he replied. \"I was just bored. I thought I'd stop by and chat, if you don't mind.\"\nQuarq uttered a short, hoarse laugh and grimaced--no, SMILED, Haezar reminded himself. \"You brownnosing little shit,\" the commander said, although not unkindly.\n\"I... I really did just come to talk.\"\n\"Mm-hm.\" There was a long pause. \"Well, go on and ask me.\"\n\"Ask you what?\"\nQuarq stretched out his arm and plucked a bottle of wine off a tray sitting nearby. He took a swig. \"Ask me why I look like I've been through a food processor. You've been dying to ever since you first saw me.\"\n\"Eh--Excuse me?\"\nThe commander chuckled. \"Bet your father taught you manners, being an ambassador and all. Only added to the natural morbid curiosity we all have. But Mongoe, he's an honest one. Probably the most straightforward guy I ever met. He doesn't have any manners, and no shame, either. He came right out and asked me one day. Handed me a brew and said, `Tell me how you earned those scars, Ugly.' \"\n\"Uh, I... \"\n\"Go on, ask me. You want to.\"\nHaezar looked quite sheepish, then replied, \"Alright... what happened to you?\"\n\"Qorant.\"\n\"You were there for the war?\"\n\"Yup. Same as you. Sent to help the Ground Forces. A bunch of unfriendlies jumped my squadron while we were on patrol. We fought back, but it didn't do any good. I was the only officer, so they kept me alive. I watched them kill whoever was left.\n\"Back at their base, they asked me questions, but I'd be damned if I'd tell 'em anything. So they beat me up, burned me, ripped up my face, and took a hammer to my fingers one by one.\" Quarq wiggled the fingers of his crooked right hand in front of him. \"Good thing I'm a lefty. Assholes... .\" He paused, sighed. \"So, when torture didn't work they got bored. They knocked me out, tied me up, and left me in the middle of nowhere to rot.\"\n\"I take it you were rescued.\"\nQuarq took another swig of the wine. \"Mm-mm,\" he said as he gulped it down. \"No. I got loose and crawled to the nearest base. Got all sick and infected and shit. Lost the sight in my left eye. I spent months in the hospital. You know what I got for my trouble?\"\n\"I suppose you're going to tell me.\"\n\"I got a medal, a promotion, and a lifetime guarantee of utter rejection from society.\" The commander paused. He covered his eyes with his free hand. \"Little kids, man... my niece... for a long time she wouldn't come near me... But women--grown, intelligent women--they think I'm some kind of rapist monster. They call me repulsive, right to my face sometimes. People... just steer clear of me. All they see is the mask I wear.\" He looked up and stared at the wall, narrowing his eyes in anger. \"I've learned to live with it,\" he growled. \"Why can't they?\" The room fell silent, save for the hum of the whirlpool. \"Go away,\" he said after a time. \"Leave me alone.\" Haezar nodded, got up, and left.\nThe lieutenant headed back down the hall. Hearing giggling emitting from Mongoe's quarters, he knocked on the door.\n\"Yeah?\" came the gruff reply after a moment.\n\"It's me. Got a minute?\"\n\"Maybe. Come in.\"\nHaezar entered to find the large man lying on his stomach on a couch, naked and being massaged by a luscious, scantily-clad young woman. \"What--?!\" Haezar sputtered, \"What are you doing?\"\n\"Gettin' massaged... and revved up, if ya know what I mean.\"\n\"But... where... what are you doing with that girl?!\"\nThe young woman giggled and kept massaging. Mongoe shot Haezar a twisted smirk. \"Well, see,\" he explained as if speaking to a curious adolescent, \"first there's this stuff called `foreplay', and then, when the guy gets nice and h--\"\n\"Shut up! What the hell do you think you're doing?\"\n\"Hey, you heard the Shaheer. He said we could make use of any of the services the palace offered.\" Mongoe smiled broadly. \"I guess this is why they call 'em `servants'.\"\nHaezar scowled. \"You're sick. Don't you have any morals?\"\n\"Do you have a sex life?\"\nHaezar growled.\nMongoe chuckled. He raised his arm and snapped his fingers twice. A second young woman emerged from the bedroom. \"Dorna, babe, do me a favor and give my friend here a nice blow job. He could use it.\"\n\"Mongoe!\" Haezar snapped. Dorna sauntered up behind him and ran her hands over his shoulders and down past his waist. \"Uh... miss... no. Please stop.\" He tried to push her away.\n\"Stop means go,\" she cooed, and nibbled on his ear.\n\"Dorna,\" Mongoe yawned, \"Not here, doll. His room's across the hall.\"\n\"Miss, I mean it,\" Haezar told her, albeit a bit weakly.\n\"So do I,\" she murmured, reaching into his pants.\n\"Have fun, Rich Boy,\" Mongoe said. \"All these babes-- they're not just meat, y'know. That Hu-Jin guy assured me that every one was smart and good conversation. And each one has at least one special talent.\"\nDorna thrust her hand farther into Haezar's pants. \"Mine's finding that little spot that makes you squirm,\" she breathed, and proceeded to prove it. Haezar yelped as his back reflexively arched. Mongoe's massive shoulders shook with laughter.\n\"Huh--h-how nice,\" Haezar squeaked, pulling Dorna's hand away. \"Better show that one to Mongoe. Goodnight.\" He hastily backed out of the room, shutting the door behind him, then ran to his own quarters, shutting AND locking the door, for a very long, very cold shower.\n5. Bedtime Stories and a Nightmare\nThe following evening.\nThe following morning Mongoe did not get up for breakfast. When Haezar went to wake him he found the lieutenant in bed, half a dozen curvaceous young women curled up against his body.\n\"I'm in heaven,\" Mongoe later remarked as he got dressed, \"Pure heaven.\" At breakfast he livened up and stuffed himself, however at Hu-Jin's briefing he nearly fell asleep.\n\"Rough night?\" Quarq whispered wryly. Mongoe chuckled.\nDuring the briefing Hu-Jin informed the squadron that two S.C.U.M. personnel were to remain with Shaheer Dyan at all times, in addition to the normal number of bodyguards. Mongoe and Haezar wound up on the same shift that evening as the young Shaheer prepared for bed.\n\"I feel like I'm babysittin', y'know?\" Mongoe grumbled as they sat in Dyan's quarters. Haezar did not answer him. \"Aw, whatsa matter, Rich Boy? Was it somethin' I said?\" The lieutenant glared at him, and seemed about to say something rather unpleasant when the Shaheer came in, dressed in his sleeping clothes. Haezar's irritated expression quickly melted into a smile.\n\"Hello,\" he greeted.\n\"Hello,\" the boy returned. He hopped up onto his bed. \"Are you here to guard me?\"\nHaezar nodded. \"Are you afraid?\"\nDyan glanced at Mongoe. \"Not with a guy as big as him to watch over me.\" The boy smiled. Mongoe smiled back, then shot a smug grin at Haezar. \"Anyway,\" the Shaheer went on with a yawn, \"Nobody can break in here. And if they do, Hu- Jin will take care of them.\"\nTime passed. Dyan fidgeted in bed, then sat up. He got up and went over to Haezar, who was sitting on a couch nearby.\n\"Can't sleep?\" the lieutenant asked.\nThe Shaheer shook his head. \"No.\" He paused. \"Have you been all over with the Space Navy?\"\n\"Yeah, I've been a lot of places. I've been a lot of places with my father, too.\"\n\"Have you fought in wars?\"\n\"One.\"\n\"What was it like?\"\n\"Unpleasant.\"\n\"Did you ever do anything really neat, like blow something up?\"\n\"Well, I--\"\n\"Did you spy on people?\"\nHaezar thought for a moment. \"Well, once I--hey!\" The lieutenant scowled as Mongoe climbed over the back of his couch and shoved him aside.\n\"Kid wants a story, eh?\" he said. \"How 'bout it, your Shaheership? Wanna real good, true story?\"\nHaezar rolled his eyes at the ceiling, but Dyan nodded his head. \"I'd like to hear about something you've done,\" he replied.\n\"Good. Okay. Once upon a time in the Qorantian War, there was this dickhead lieutenant named Haezar who was sent in with his squad by the Space Navy to help out a certain Sergeant-Major Mongoe and his troops. The Sarge and his men had been there for a real long time and knew the territory real well. They knew a lot about the enemy, too. But this jerk Haezar, he fucked things up real good. See, he wasn't a bad guy or nothin' but he was one of them know-it-all academy wussies. Or maybe his jock strap was too tight. I dunno.\n\"Anyway, since Haezar outranked Mongoe, he wouldn't listen to any of Mongoe's advice, even though Mongoe had been in the military twice as long and had been in Qorant since the war started. This got everyone into trouble.\n\"See, one day, dickhead Haezar gets this dumbass scheme: He's gonna take out one of the enemy's major defensive trenches, right? Well, Sarge says no, the conditions aren't right, but the stupid jerk goes on with it anyway. Half a squadron of Space Navy and Ground Forces troops later, he realizes his mistake. But does he retreat with the rest? No! He keeps chargin' the fuckin' trench! But Mongoe, bein' the nice guy he is, goes back out and covers the dickhead's ass just long enough to take a piece of shrapnel in his side. So Haezar drags him back to the others, cleans him up, patches the wound, then like the dumbass he is asks the Sarge, `Are you okay?' \"\n\"What did you say?\" Dyan asked.\n\"Nothin'. I planted my fist in his jaw and laid him out cold in the dirt. But all's well that ends well, y'know. The squad managed to pull out, and everybody lived more or less happily ever after--except the ones who got wiped before their tour was up--and good ol' Sarge wound up with a huge, ugly scar runnin' from hip to ribcage. The end.\"\nHaezar refused to even look at Mongoe, even after their shift was over and they went to bed.\nTheir grievance did not last long, however, because several hours later they were awakened by Hu-Jin's frantic cries:\n\"The Shaheer is gone! The Shaheer is gone!\"\nA minute later and all of them were assembled in Dyan's room: Mongoe, Haezar, Quarq, and Hu-Jin. The place was crawling with investigative agents. On the floor were the two S.C.U.M. personnel who had taken over for Haezar and Mongoe, both neatly beheaded. Their hands still held their guns. Their severed heads, lying several feet away, were frozen almost amusing, shocked expressions. There were laser burns on the walls from their weapons but no indication of anything else wrong, let alone any other weapon.\n\"It's spooky, Advisor,\" one of the agents told Hu-Jin, \"Not one thing's out of place. No sign of a struggle, no tracks, no fingerprints--nothing. The window is still locked from the inside. None of the outside guards heard anything, and there's no indication of anyone unauthorized having been on the Grounds.\"\nHu-Jin narrowed his eyes. \"You know what this has to mean,\" he replied gravely. \"It was a Nightmare.\"\n\"A what?\" Quarq asked.\n\"A Nightmare. They are Neemohne's most questionable legends.\"\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\"The Nightmares, or Nightmare--no one is sure; we assume there are more than one--are believed to be a group of professional assassins, spies, and killers, and possibly thieves. They might be good or bad, or perhaps neither. They may work for people or act on their own. Maybe both. They mostly strike at night, hence the name. Whatever the case, only a Nightmare can do what has been done here.\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" Mongoe interjected, \"You keep saying `maybe' and `believed to be.' And then you said something about `questionable legends.' Do you know what we're up against or not?\"\n\"No,\" Hu-Jin replied. \"No one knows if the Nightmares actually exist.\"\n\"And why's that?\" Quarq inquired.\n\"Because no one who sees one lives to tell about it.\"\n\"Aw, come on!\" Mongoe snapped. \"What kinda crap are you feeding us? Tell your stories to yer kids, man. I don't believe in ghosts, and I don't believe in blaming 'em just 'cause someone turns up neatly dead.\"\n\"This sort of thing has happened throughout the centuries. It's always the same: the deaths are clean--by poison or by blade--and there are no clues.\"\n\"You think the Shaheer is dead, then,\" Haezar said solemnly.\n\"Actually, no,\" Hu-Jin replied. \"It's obvious the child was kidnapped. Whoever is receiving the boy, however, may very well intend to kill him.\"\n\"What about the Alat crystal?\" Quarq broke in. \"Is it still there?\"\n\"Yes, I checked. The Alat is kept in a very secure area to begin with, and it's recently been moved to an even safer place. But even if someone does get it, it will be very hard for them to use it. The Alat knows its master. As long as he or she lives, it won't give in to a new one so easily.\"\n\"You're talkin' like it's a person,\" Mongoe grumbled. \"And whadduya mean, `give in'?\"\n\"The Alat's a powerful object.\"\n\"Yeah, right. Sure. I don't go in for all this magic crap.\"\n\"Mongoe!\" Quarq snapped in warning.\n\"It's alright,\" Hu-Jin told him. He looked over at the agents. \"Keep searching,\" he told them, then turned back to the threesome. \"Come,\" he told them, \"I'll show you.\"\nThe Advisor led them through the palace to a restricted- access elevator. He used a palm-scan to unlock the door guarding the elevator, then a special code-card to open the doors. Once inside, he punched out another code on a series of buttons to turn the elevator on, then used a tiny key to actually get it moving. The car descended several floors. The four men emerged at the beginning of a long, plain hall. Hu-Jin locked up the elevator, then slid another code-card into a slot on the wall.\n\"What are you doing now?\" Haezar asked him.\n\"Deactivating the security,\" the Advisor replied. \"Quiet, now.\" He looked down the hall and spoke up. \"Deactivation password: Vulnerable.\" There was a momentary pause. A tone sounded. \"It's safe to pass now.\"\nThe small group walked to the end of the hall, where Hu- Jin performed yet another variety of tasks to gain access into a vault. At the center of the vault, standing silently on within a glass case on a pedestal, was a dull, grayish lump of crystal.\n\"Don't go any closer,\" Hu-Jin warned. \"The case's security system is still on.\"\n\"That's it?\" Mongoe burst out. \"That's what all the fuss is over? That rock?\" Quarq shot him a warning look uglier than his face, but Hu-Jin smiled.\n\"Watch--and listen,\" he said. He closed his eyes and, still smiling faintly, his breathing slowed and his body became relaxed.\nThe Alat seemed to light up, only faintly at first, then suddenly burst into life, a dazzling array of iridescent blue-green light glowing in its core. The faint sound of wind chimes could be heard in the still room.\n\"It knows its master's servant,\" Hu-Jin murmured.\n\"Hmph,\" Mongoe grumped. \"Watcha usin'? A hundred watt bulb?\"\nFor the second time Hu-Jin's sadistically pleased grin surfaced. A wide ray of light shot out from the crystal, catching Mongoe in the chest and throwing him into the wall.\n\"What the--?!\" Quarq started. Hu-Jin opened his eyes, and the crystal went dark again.\n\"Woof,\" Mongoe gasped as he picked himself up. \"What hit me?\"\n\"My mind, focused and amplified through the Alat,\" Hu- Jin explained, still smiling. \"I am capable of some control with the crystal due to natural ability and my closeness to Dyan. What I did was a simple defense. Are you convinced now, my friend?\"\nMongoe grumbled something under his breath. He seemed a bit humbled.\n\"Advisor,\" Quarq said, looking rather distressed, \"We failed to protect the Shaheer. I'm sorry. I take full responsibility.\"\n\"It wasn't your fault,\" Hu-Jin replied, almost gently. \"In any case, I have a feeling this isn't over yet.\"\n\"I promise to do my best to get the Shaheer back, sir,\" Quarq told him.\nThe Advisor looked down at him. \"I'm sure you will,\" he replied, although now his words and eyes were flat and cold, almost threatening.\n6. \"And if you don't... \"\nShaheer's Palace, early morning.\n\"Advisor Hu-Jin,\" greeted one of the servants as the group returned to the main palace, \"There's a woman on the video communications channel. She claims she has the Shaheer, and she's making demands.\"\n\"Where's the signal coming from?\" the Advisor asked.\n\"We don't know, sir. It's being routed through one of the public channels.\"\nHu-Jin led the others to a commons room. A large video screen adorned one wall, and on it was a poorly broadcasted picture. The person on the screen was a woman, but one could only discern this from her voice and curves; she was shrouded in shadow.\n\"I am Hu-Jin, Advisor to the Shaheer,\" Hu-Jin addressed the screen. \"I demand--\"\n\"You are in no position to demand anything,\" the woman snapped, then went on in a more silky, amused tone. \"I am known as Shadow. I have your Shaheer.\" Someone out of camera range thrust Dyan into view. The boy seemed unhurt, but there were tear stains on his face.\n\"Hu-Jin! Help me! Please come get me!\" he cried, and was abruptly pulled away.\n\"I have no desire to hurt the child,\" Shadow went on. \"All I want is the Alat. Unfortunately, your security was simply too good. You see, I ran out of thieves to steal the crystal for me, so I made special arrangements to steal the boy instead. My demands are simple. You will exchange the Alat for the Shaheer. I will require proof that the crystal is genuine.\"\n\"I will give you any sum of money for the Shaheer,\" Hu- Jin replied. \"The Alat is of no use to anyone but the Qol. It has been proven. No one will buy it from you.\"\n\"No deals!\" Shadow insisted. \"What I want and plan to do with the Alat is not your concern!\"\n\"I do know. I'm no fool. You're in this with Zyal. You're a third party hired to do his dirty work.\"\n\"Stop jerking me around, Advisor. You will agree to the arrangement.\"\n\"And if I don't?\"\n\"And if you don't,\" Shadow cooed, \"I'll have no choice but to kill the child.\"\nQuarq pulled Hu-Jin aside. \"The Shaheer's life is more important than the Alat,\" he said quietly. \"Agree to the trade. Hopefully my troops can stop it before it goes through. If they can't, keep in mind that we can always go after the Alat, but the Shaheer is irreplaceable.\"\nThe Advisor nodded. \"You're right. Since the woman is Zyal's hireling, my own men can take action against her. We can help you.\"\nAt this point Mongoe leaned close. \"I don't think she's working for Zyal,\" he said.\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\"When you accused her of working for him, she made a quick comeback. No hesitation, no change of expression. She didn't flinch or shift or move at all. I know people, sir, and I could tell she didn't know what you were talking about. Trust me on this one.\"\n\"Hmm... whatever the case, I agree with Quarq.\" Hu-Jin turned back to Shadow. \"I'll make the trade,\" he said.\n\"Good,\" she replied. \"You will bring the Alat to Quarry Ten. Come alone.\"\nThe Advisor frowned. \"I told you, I'm no fool.\"\nShadow gave a somewhat exasperated sigh. Although her face remained unseen, he gaze could be felt shifting to the commandoes. \"Alright,\" she said, waving the argument off with her hand, \"You can bring these three Westerners with you, but that's all. If I see or hear anyone else, the boy dies.\"\n\"Agreed,\" Hu-Jin replied with a nod. \"When will we do this?\"\n\"Now,\" Shadow told him.\n\"Now?!\"\n\"Well, I can't give you time to prepare, can I?\" the woman laughed, toying with a lock of her hair. \"I estimate that it will take you five minutes to get the Alat out of the place where you keep it, and I know it takes ten minutes to get from the palace to Quarry Ten. I will expect you in fifteen minutes. Don't be late.\" The screen went dark.\n\"I'll get the troops organized while you get the Alat,\" Haezar told Hu-Jin.\n\"Our troops don't know the area, and neither do you,\" Quarq replied. \"We'll have to use Hu-Jin's men.\"\n\"No,\" Hu-Jin replied, \"I won't risk the Shaheer's life. We don't have time to think up an offensive.\"\n\"Maybe a sniper?\" Haezar suggested.\n\"No,\" the Advisor repeated. \"Quarry Ten is on high ground. It's dug out of a mountain side. Whoever's there can see anyone coming, and there are plenty of places to hide lookouts and troops. We'll do what the woman says. But,\" he added, lovingly caressing the hilt of his sword, \"should the opportunity present itself, I'm sure four fine warriors like us will do just fine.\" He smiled his eerie smile again. \"Go prepare yourselves while I get the Alat.\"\n\"Varkeshna,\" Zyal of the Moran-shan clan said to the huge bodyguard at his side as he spun lazily in his office chair, \"Make a note in my log, will you?\" Varkeshna stationed himself before a desk-top computer and rested his fingers lightly on the keyboard, prepared to type. \"Tenth day of Sixth Month,\" Zyal began. \"While experimenting with my video broadcast equipment, I came upon a pirate transmission on a public channel to the Shaheer's Palace. Apparently--to my horror, of course--Shaheer Dyan has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom by a mercenary woman calling herself Shadow. The ransom is the Alat, to be brought by Advisor Hu-Jin and three visiting Western Loords to the old Quarry Ten. Since I fear for the Shaheer's life, I have decided to send a very small force in after Hu-Jin arrives there. When the mercenary is convinced of her safety and is focusing her attention on Hu-Jin, my people will move in and hopefully rescue the Shaheer. End of entry.\"\nZyal leaned back in his seat as Varkeshna finished typing. \"Varkeshna,\" he said, \"take our best sniper and go to Quarry Ten. It is our duty to save our dear Shaheer, as well as the Alat. When he and the mercenary and any of her people are out in the open, have the sniper open fire.\" Zyal gave a tight, unpleasant smile. \"Unfortunately, poor Dyan will take a stray shot. What a... tragic end to my heroic attempt to save him.\" He chuckled. \"But we will manage to save the Alat. You understand, Varkeshna?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the bodyguard rumbled.\n\"Good. Go.\" The huge man turned to leave. \"Oh, and Varkeshna--\"\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\"If one of those stray shots should also happen to hit Hu-Jin... .\"\nVarkeshna replied with a wicked grin. \"I'm sure we'll enjoy his grand warrior's funeral feast, despite our grief.\"\n7. Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones, but Particle Acceleration Beams Really Do a Nasty Job\nA short time later.\n\"Ready to go?\" Haezar asked as he came into Mongoe's quarters. Both of them were in battle armor, however Mongoe's was older and much heavier, and made him look twice as large than he actually was. His gear was in fact the same as he had used in Qorant. There was a thick welded and bolted on metal patch on the torso piece's side where it had been pierced. Haezar mentally winced from the reminder.\n\"Yeah, just about,\" the large lieutenant replied. He pulled a case out from the closet, laid it on a table, and opened it. Inside was a large, outdated bazooka, meant to be braced against the side, and not placed on the shoulder. Despite its battered and worn casing, it was obvious that new parts had been added and that the back and front of the barrel had been modified. Mongoe checked the weapon over, fastened a strap to it, and slung it over his shoulder. \"Now I'm ready,\" he informed Haezar.\n\"You still have that thing?\" Haezar returned in disbelief. \"Haven't they caught you yet?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"You can't use that! Quarq could report you!\"\n\"So let him.\"\n\"Oh, you seem real concerned,\" Haezar sneered. \"We'll see how smug you are when someone in the right place finds out what really happened to their experimental weapons!\"\nMongoe frowned. \"Look, shit-fer-brains,\" he rumbled, \"You could've reported me a hundred times between Qorant and now, but you didn't. You know why? `Cause my baby here saved your ass. Maybe today it'll save it again. Maybe the Shaheer's, and maybe even Quarq's, too. People tend to overlook little details when you save their life, right, Rich Boy?\"\n\"Um... right.\"\n\"So shuddup and mind your own business.\" Mongoe made his way to the door. \"I'd rather be demoted than dead, anyway,\" he mumbled. \"Come on.\"\nTen minutes later Hu-Jin pulled an unmarked hovercar off the main road and up a narrower, winding trail. Before the foursome lay a grouping of barren, rocky hills, quietly baking in the living desert of Qol. Even from a distance the old, abandoned quarry, which had been scooped out of the side of the largest hill, seemed large and foreboding.\n\"Mongoe,\" Quarq said as he eyed the lieutenant's \"baby\", \"what is that thing?\"\n\"Just an old bazooka, sir,\" Mongoe replied.\n\"I've never seen one like that before.\"\nMongoe shot Haezar a discreet look through his sunglasses. \"Oh, hell,\" Haezar put in after a slight hesitation, \"my uncle used to use one of those things. That piece of crap's so ancient, I'm surprised the Ground Forces haven't retired it.\"\n\"They're just stingy, that's all,\" Mongoe laughed. \"Had to be modified just to, ah, pack a noticeable whollop against today's equipment.\"\n\"Mm,\" Quarq replied, and returned his attention to the quarry ahead. \"Remember,\" he said, \"first sign of a slip-up on the enemy's part and we move for the kill. Otherwise, don't do anything stupid or without my or Hu-Jin's orders.\" The commander reached into his pocket and pulled out a curious device which he proceeded to place over his sighted eye. It fitted like an eye patch, and looked like half a pair of goggles.\n\"What's that?\" Mongoe asked him.\n\"Just some insurance,\" Quarq replied. \"I've only got one eye left; I don't plan on losing it.\"\nWhen Hu-Jin pulled into Quarry Ten, no one could be seen. The only thing stirring was the dust cloud the hovercar's engines kicked up.\n\"Turn the engine off!\" a woman's voice, presumably Shadow's, demanded through a speaker or megaphone. The Advisor obliged her. \"Get out of the car.\" Hu-Jin and the commandoes stepped out. \"Good. Now walk to the center of the quarry.\" The foursome obeyed without hesitation. \"Put down your weapons.\"\n\"I ain't stupid, lady!\" Mongoe shouted back.\n\"Funny, you look stupid to me,\" Shadow returned.\n\"Where is the Shaheer?!\" Hu-Jin yelled, his hand on the grip of his sword as he scanned the high walls of the quarry.\nShadow's chuckling echoed across the quarry. \"You men are such morons,\" she mused. \"Patience, oh Balding One, and don't get carried away. You're past your prime.\"\nHu-Jin snorted. \"Come down here, bitch,\" he said, his horrible grin adorning his features, \"and I'll show you how quickly I can flay a person without killing them.\"\nThe mercenary laughed. \"Alright,\" she said, \"keep your little toys. But keep them sheathed or in their holsters. Now, where is the Alat?\"\nHu-Jin reached into his jacket and produced a pouch. \"It's in here.\"\n\"Show me.\" Reluctantly, the Advisor took the crystal out and held it up. As if sensing the proximity of the Shaheer, it lit up with a warm glow. The sound of chimes echoed off the rocks. \"Excellent. Put it down and back away.\"\n\"So your people can kill us?\" Quarq spoke up.\n\"My people,\" Shadow replied with distaste, \"have all been slaughtered while attempting to steal the Alat. And they called themselves thieves.\" She sighed. \"Well, no small loss, especially now that I am currently employing more reliable help. I have no desire to start a fight. I only want the Alat.\"\n\"Show yourself,\" Hu-Jin demanded, \"and the Shaheer. Otherwise there's no deal.\"\nThere was a long pause, and then the sound of footsteps on gravel. Two figures appeared on the opposite end of the quarry. One was a tall, slender offworlder woman with long raven-hued hair. The other was much smaller, quite obviously the Shaheer.\n\"Hu-Jin! Hu-Jin!\" Dyan cried.\n\"It's alright, little master,\" the Advisor returned, for the first time looking worried, \"You'll be fine.\" He looked around, and his eyes fell upon a double set of rails leading across the quarry. On each pair of tracks was an old cart, probably used at one time for transporting rubble or ore. He went over to one, disengaged the brake, and with a grunt gave it a good shove. To his surprise it was in fair condition after so much disuse; it glided easily across the quarry. \"Woman,\" he called with a sneer, \"Put the Shaheer in the cart and push him back--if you can. I'll put the Alat in this cart here, and push it to you. Agreed?\"\n\"Agreed,\" Shadow replied.\n\"No, Hu-Jin!\" the Shaheer yelled, \"Don't!\"\n\"Don't worry, master,\" Hu-Jin replied. \"Do as I tell you.\"\n\"And no tricks!\" Shadow snapped. \"I know what the boy can do with the stone.\" She drew a pistol with an aiming scope. \"If anything funny starts happening when the boy passes the Alat, I'll kill him.\"\n\"And what assurance do we have that your `reliable help' won't fire down on him anyway?\"\n\"You don't. But then, you're in no place to argue.\" Shadow dragged Dyan over to the cart and set him inside. \"Put the Alat in your cart.\" Hu-Jin did as told. He and Shadow locked stared at each other from across the quarry, then almost simultaneously set their carts in motion. The mercenary, contrary to Hu-Jin's assumption, had little difficulty with the task. For a moment the Advisor seemed impressed.\nWhen the two carts drew near, a large man suddenly appeared from the rocks, running at breakneck speed toward the cart holding the Alat.\n\"What the--?!\" Quarq started. He and the others instinctively raised their weapons, but by that time the man had already grabbed the Alat and jumped off. Quarq and Haezar--and Shadow, to their surprise--squeezed off several shots which hit the vacated cart as the man fled across the quarry and up into the rocks.\n\"Get him!\" Haezar yelled, and ran after the man.\n\"Wait!\" Mongoe called, and was ignored. He started after the lieutenant, then halted. A shot from somewhere above and to the left scorched a piece of abandoned equipment he had been leaning against. \"SNIPER!\" he bellowed, and dove for cover behind the machine. Hu-Jin and Quarq joined him. A shot hit the front right wheel of the cart the Shaheer rode in, and it ground to a halt. Dyan crowded his small body into a corner, pulling rubble and old tools around him.\n\"The Shaheer!\" the Advisor exclaimed, horrified. He got up and ran toward the second cart, dodging behind rocks and equipment as he went.\n\"Come back, sir!\" Quarq shouted. He growled and turned to Mongoe. \"Go after Haezar!\" he snapped, his face a hideous mask of rage. The lieutenant took off as Quarq fired in the general direction the sniper's shots were coming from in an attempt to cover Hu-Jin.\nHaezar, meanwhile, stopped abruptly in his tracks as he heard a sharp cry of pain. He clutched his rifle tightly as he cautiously advanced. His prey had vanished through a narrow pass in the rocks and had turned to the right before he had lost sight of him. Moving as quietly as possible, Haezar quickly sidestepped through the pass and spun out, his weapon at the ready. No one was there.\nNo one living, that is.\nThe large man's body lay crumpled on the rocks. His head was nowhere in sight. Nervously, the lieutenant advanced and turned the body over. Underneath, still in his hand, was the Alat. Haezar gingerly picked it up.\nSomething hit him in the back. With a cry of alarm, he spun around, firing his rifle. He hit only the rocks. No one was in sight. He looked down at his feet to see what had struck him, and saw the dead man's head staring up at him, wearing an expression of pure terror.\nA leather-gloved hand closed tightly around the back of Haezar's neck. The lieutenant immediately moved to counter, but the new intruder's fingers dug into his spine and held on with an iron grip. Haezar's knees buckled. The unseen attacker shifted his hold ever so slightly and squeezed a bit harder. Haezar cried out in pain. The rifle dropped from his right hand, but his left refused to part with the Alat.\n\"Stupid boy,\" the man behind him growled. \"Shall I snap your neck now? Perhaps. But first, give me the crystal.\"\nHaezar grit his teeth. \"No,\" he managed. \"You can... take it... off my dead... body.\"\nHis attacker laughed. \"Stupid, stupid, boy!\" With almost inhuman strength, he threw Haezar against the rock wall. \"That is exactly how I intended it in the first place!\"\nThe lieutenant looked up. Standing over him was a man clad entirely in the blackest of black clothing imaginable, his head covered by a black hood, his face hidden by a visor attached to a lightweight helm. At his side was a long, slender, black-handled sword with a black, skull-shaped pommel, nestled in a black scabbard. There were other bladed items fastened to his belt as well, ones which Haezar could not recognize.\n\"Who--?\" Haezar gagged, almost in a whimper. There was something utterly terrifying about this strange man.\nIn each hand, the man took a curious weapon from his belt. They consisted of a handle with the skull pommel (black, of course) and a short length of chain which ended in a foot-long, very sharp-looking blade. The man began to twirl the blades in patterns at dizzying speeds. \"You are fortunate to have seen me,\" he murmured, \"Few do.\" He paused, then proclaimed, \"I am your death! Know me, boy--I am Sorasta, Champion of the Dancing Blades!\"\nHaezar cringed. He heard something off to the side as Sorasta bore down on him; quite like the sound of a very muffled cannon blast. Suddenly Sorasta seemed to glow. His expression of astonishment could be felt through his visor as he looked down at his midsection, only to find it was rapidly disintegrating. An instant later he was gone.\nMongoe plodded up to his companion, hawked and spit on the rocks, and affectionately patted his strange bazooka. \"An' I'm Mongoe, Bearer of the Unauthorized Custom Particle Acceleration Beam,\" he snorted.\n\"You--you saved my life!\" Haezar squawked, wide-eyed.\nMongoe rolled his eyes. \"Brilliant observation. Man, you're flakier than an unwashed jock strap!\" He hauled the lieutenant to his feet. \"Come on,\" he grunted. He disappeared back through the pass. Haezar paused briefly. He picked up one of the strange twirling weapons, which Sorasta had dropped just before his atoms had scattered, and followed Mongoe.\nDown in the main area of the quarry, Shadow ducked behind a pile of gravel and fired off several shots at Hu- Jin.\n\"You lousy bastards!\" she screamed. She tore a grenade from her belt and pitched it at the Advisor. The explosive went wide, however, and he managed to escape unharmed. She unslung a high-powered rifle from her back, switched it into rapid fire mode, and fired across the quarry at Quarq.\n\"You stupid crazy bitch!\" he bellowed after the first volley narrowly missed him.\n\"We did what you said!\" Hu-Jin shouted. \"Have you no honor?!\"\nShadow let loose a burst of fire which came dangerously close to the cart the Shaheer lay in. \"Call off your sniper or I'll blow the boy to hell!\"\n\"Our sniper?! That's not my sniper! He's been shooting at me, or haven't you noticed?\"\nShadow's face flushed in anger and humiliation as she realized her mistake. `But,' she thought, `if the sniper isn't theirs, and it's definitely not mine--not unless Sorasta's gone trigger-happy, which he shouldn't have, for what I'm paying him--then who's firing at us?' She moved along through the rubble, scanning the rocks above for the gunman. \"What the hell is going on here?\" she muttered. Several shots from somewhere above came dangerously close to hitting her. \"Alright,\" she snarled, \"now I'm pissed!\" She ducked behind a rock and fired blindly up in the direction the shots had come from.\nHu-Jin, realizing the sniper was now occupied with the mercenary, made a dash for the cart. He plucked the Shaheer from his hiding place and ran back toward Quarq. The sniper realized what had happened and fired at the Advisor. The man was moving astonishingly well for his age, however, and somehow managed to get back to Quarq only singed and slightly bloody from a shot which had grazed his back instead of cutting him in half at the waist.\n\"Are you alright?\" the commander asked him.\n\"Never better,\" Hu-Jin replied, setting Dyan down. \"Nothing like an annoying flesh wound to get you really pissed and ready to lop off a few limbs!\" He drew his sword, a wide and powerful blade, etched with designs and brightly polished. \"I'm going to try to sneak around and up,\" he said. \"Maybe I can find the bastard and jump him from behind. Cover me.\" Without waiting for Quarq's approval, he scampered off.\nNo sooner had he gone than Mongoe and Haezar came out of the rocks behind the commander.\n\"That guy's toast, and Haezar's got the crystal,\" Mongoe informed him.\n\"Where's Hu-Jin?\" Haezar asked.\nDyan smiled a wicked little grin, a perfect copy of the Advisor's. \"He went to kick ass,\" he replied.\nThe sniper's firing, however, continued to pour down. Mongoe, deciding that it was not worth the risk to Hu-Jin, set his particle acceleration beam aside, pulled a laser pistol, and fired back at the unseen foe along with Haezar and Quarq.\nAt length Hu-Jin returned. \"I know where he is,\" he huffed.\n\"So why didn't you ace him?\" Mongoe asked.\n\"I couldn't. He didn't see me, but I saw his face. He had the diamond tattoo--the mark of the Morin-shans. I cannot kill him.\"\n\"He doesn't seem to give a shit about killing you!\"\n\"It does not matter. The situation is such that I cannot risk violating our treaty.\"\n\"Morin-shan?\" Quarq muttered, \"Maybe Zyal sent him.\"\n\"Maybe,\" Mongoe grunted. \"Who cares?\" He picked up his bazooka--or rather, the weapon which appeared to be a bazooka. \"Where is he?\"\nHu-Jin pointed. \"Up there.\"\n\"Hey,\" Quarq remarked, shooting a glance back at Mongoe, \"That thing's not loaded!\"\nMongoe quickly jumped into the open and fired. A large portion of the top of the quarry disintegrated.\nQuarq's mouth fell open. \"What the--?\"\n\"Yeah!\" Mongoe laughed. \"End of problem.\"\nThe commander looked over at him, astonished. \"What is that thing?\"\nThe lieutenant kissed the barrel of his weapon. \"My baby,\" he replied.\nHu-Jin got to his feet. \"Well, that's more or less settled,\" he remarked, \"except for that blasted woman. At least we have the Shaheer and the Alat back. Good work, Lieutenant.\" He turned to Haezar.\nThe man was facedown in the gravel, quite unconscious.\nThe Alat was nowhere in sight.\nIn his office, Zyal closed his eyes and reached out with his mind. He could feel the Alat moving away from the quarry. He frowned. It was not moving toward him. His expression darkened.\n`Varkeshna and the sniper must have failed', he thought angrily. `Either that or they've betrayed me.' He sought out the crystal a second time. To his surprise, the Alat was not moving toward the Shaheer's Grounds. It was moving quite rapidly and very definitely in the direction of the aerospaceport.\nHe left his office and called for his chauffeur.\nShadow smiled as she pulled into Qol's aerospaceport. Her ship was there, and in minutes she and the Alat would be safely in it. With a little luck, air traffic control would give her priority takeoff for some reason she'd make up, and she'd be off the planet before anyone caught on to what was happening.\nBriefly she wondered about Sorasta. She had not seen him leave the quarry, but then, the only time she actually had seen him was when he had brought her Dyan, and even then he had been a dark form lurking in the shadows. She did not dwell on his whereabouts for long. He had already been well paid for his services, and his kind could very easily take care of themselves, from what she had heard.\nShe smuggled the Alat easily through what she considered to be the Qols' rather primitive customs system, then drove on to her ship. It was docked with numerous other small, private ships in a hangar out beyond the main take-off sites.\nAs she opened the cargo bay hatch so she could get her hovercar in, a man in expensive attire strode up to her.\n\"What do you want?\" she asked him as she worked.\n\"I have come for something,\" the man replied in cultured tones.\n\"Yeah?\" There was something about him Shadow did not care for.\n\"You have in your possession something which belongs to my people.\"\nShadow froze for an instant, then casually put her hands on her hips. Her fingers carefully made their way toward the gun tucked under her jacket. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" she said.\n\"You do,\" the visitor replied. \"It's in the satchel you're wearing. Kindly hand it over, and I will allow you to leave Neemohne.\"\nShadow sneered and drew her gun.\nHer arm froze.\nThe man smiled faintly. \"What's wrong, my dear? Have your joints locked? Having a little trouble pulling that trigger, hm? Take a look at your satchel.\"\nThe mercenary briefly glanced down at the bag. She could make out a faint glow from under the front flap.\n\"You have the Alat,\" Zyal smiled, \"and I know that for a fact because I'm using it against you.\"\nShadow growled and tried to will her finger to pull the trigger. She failed. Her antagonist narrowed his eyes and breathed in sharply. Her whole body froze. \"Let me go!\" she demanded.\nZyal looked into her eyes. \"Relax,\" he commanded in a deep, quiet voice. \"Look into me. Deep into me.\" Shadow's face became calm. Bewilderment showed through in her eyes. \"Board your ship and prepare for takeoff. I will arrange for your immediate departure.\"\n\"Buh... bastard... \"\n\"Your will is mine until you leave here!\" Zyal hissed. Inside the satchel, the Alat began to glow more brightly. \"Now, you may move your arm--the one without gun. Give me the Alat.\"\n\"Nnnnnoooo... .\" Shadow moaned, but the limb did as told. Zyal took the crystal.\n\"Put away the gun.\" Again, his command was obeyed, although now the woman was scowling terribly. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead as she tried to resist. Zyal stared hard into her eyes and concentrated. \"Relax... ,\" he commanded. The Alat throbbed with light. \"Load your ship, get in, and leave when you are cleared! Is that clear?\"\n\"Yes,\" Shadow replied.\nZyal backed off. \"My, you're a spunky one,\" he smiled. \"When you leave this world, you will not remember our encounter or what business you had here. You will not return. Now go.\"\nShadow eventually did remember the Alat--Zyal did not tell her to forget that, only her business in Qol--however, by the time she did and managed to put the pieces together, she was much to far away to do anything about it.\n8. Temper Tantrum\nShaheer's palace, shortly after the incident at the quarry; Zyal's mansion, shortly after that\n\"Tell me again what happened,\" Hu-Jin prompted Haezar as they sat in the Advisor's office.\nThe lieutenant put a fresh cold pack to the lump at the base of this skull. \"I chased the guy with the Alat through a passage in the rocks. When I came through he was dead. I picked up the Alat. Someone through his head at me, but when I turned around no one was there. Then someone else dressed in black tried to kill me, but Mongoe got to him first.\"\n\"Shouldn't've stopped to recite his damn poetry,\" Mongoe put in. \"Fuckin' looney.\"\n\"Poetry?\" Hu-Jin inquired.\n\"Yeah. He said somethin' about bein' So-and-so of the Dancing Blades. `Know your death, boy,' and all that.\"\nThe Advisor's eyes narrowed in concentration. \"How did he try to kill you, Lieutenant?\"\nHaezar reached into his fatigue pocket and produced the strange, bladed weapon he had picked up at the quarry. \"With a couple of these,\" he said, handing it over to Hu-Jin.\n\"Did he carry a firearm?\"\n\"Not that I could see.\"\n\"How interesting,\" Hu-Jin remarked as he looked the weapon over. \"I do believe the two of you encountered a Nightmare.\" He paused. \"Imagine that. You saw and killed a Nightmare. Extraordinary. I'll have to go look at the remains.\"\n\"Uh... ,\" Mongoe mumbled, \"There aren't any.\"\n\"None? Not even parts?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"No blood?\"\n\"No. Sorry.\"\nHu-Jin snorted. \"What a dull kill.\"\nQuarq came into the room. \"We contacted the authorities, then called the aerospaceport,\" he informed the Advisor, \"but we were too late. A woman answering to Shadow's description was cleared for priority takeoff before we got a chance to do anything.\"\n\"Damn,\" Hu-Jin growled, raking his fingernails across his desk. With each passing second, he was looking less like the kindly, aging man the commandoes had originally met.\n\"The people at air traffic control told me Zyal gave the order for her clearance.\"\nWith a roar, Hu-Jin leapt to his feet, drew his sword, and buried it in the desk. Haezar involuntarily jerked away while Quarq remained unmoved. Mongoe looked on, amused and impressed.\n\"I'll throttle him with his entrails!\" the Advisor declared. It was far from an idle threat. \"I'll feed him his privates! I'll--!\"\nHe was cut short as Dyan entered the office. Immediately his furor melted, or at least became masked by a placid expression. \"What are you doing out of bed, master?\" he inquired. \"You should be resting.\"\nThe boy approached and ran his hand along the flat of Hu-Jin's sword. \"I went to sleep and had a dream,\" he said. He seemed somehow upset or disturbed. \"The Alat was pulling me. It was crying and telling me to come and asking me to help.\"\nHu-Jin leaned forward. \"Do you still feel the pulling now?\"\n\"Yes,\" Dyan replied, and began to cry. \"I can feel it and I can see it and I can hear it in my head!\"\nThe Advisor picked the boy up. \"Then the woman does not have it,\" he said. \"If you feel this strongly, it's somewhere nearby. He affectionately tousled the child's hair. \"Reach out,\" he told the Shaheer. \"Who has it? Where is it?\"\nDyan sniffled, closed his eyes, and remained quiet for a time. \"Someone's trying to make it do things it doesn't want to,\" he said at length. \"There's a lot of power. There's... a mansion... .\"\n\"Zyal?\" Quarq inquired.\nHu-Jin nodded. \"He must have taken the Alat from the mercenary.\" He set Dyan down. \"Go back to your room now,\" he told the boy. \"We'll get the Alat.\"\n\"But--\"\n\"Go.\"\nThe Shaheer turned to leave, then paused briefly to consider the massive sword stuck in the Advisor's desk. \"You really shouldn't do that to your sword,\" he offered thoughtfully. \"It dulls the blade.\" He managed a slight smile and left the office.\nHu-Jin sighed as he removed the weapon from his desk. \"We have no proof that Zyal hired the woman,\" he informed the others as he sheathed it, \"but he did send the sniper and the other man. Still, I want to go to him as civilly as possible and request that he return the Alat. I want the three of you to come with me, and I want you to bring your troops. If things are anything less than civil,\" he added, smiling evilly, \"I want to be able wash my hands in the Morin-shans' blood without causing a war.\"\nThe Alat was fascinating, invigorating--Zyal could not put it down. He sat in his office, so absorbed with his newfound power he did not respond to the person pounding on for some time. Finally, he tore his attention away from the Alat, hid it in his desk, and answered the door. His security chief greeted him, looking somewhat ill at ease.\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"Advisor Hu-Jin has been spotted heading this way. He's leading a small squadron of foreign troops.\"\nZyal considered. \"Fine. Let them in.\"\n\"Sir?\"\n\"Do as I say. I'll grant them audience.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the security chief replied, and exited the office.\nZyal went to his desk and removed the Alat. `And then I'll destroy them.'\n\"And what can I do for you, Advisor?\" Zyal smiled as both his and the S.C.U.M. troops stood in his meeting hall.\n\"It has come to my attention,\" Hu-Jin replied stiffly, \"that you have the Alat.\"\nZyal simply looked at him, his hands behind his back.\n\"I thank you for recovering it. All of Qol will thank you.\" The Advisor was outwardly calm, yet it was obvious from his stance that he was fighting to control his temper.\n\"Why have you brought all these soldiers here?\" Zyal asked. He briefly glanced at his own troops, lined up on either side of the hall.\n\"Simply to ensure the Alat's safe return to the palace,\" Hu-Jin replied.\n\"Why are they foreign troops?\"\n\"They were sent here to assist me in certain matters. Right now my own forces are fully occupied with making sure no further harm will come to our Shaheer.\"\n\"I see.\"\nHu-Jin held out his hand. \"Now, if you please, the Alat.\"\nZyal brought out the crystal from behind his back. It pulsed with energy. He could feel the power oozing through his veins as he stared deep into the brilliant color emanating from its center. He concentrated.\n\"No,\" he replied, \"I DON'T please.\"\nThe hall became hushed as confused murmurings broke out amongst Zyal's security troops.\n\"So,\" Hu-Jin said in a low voice, \"you did hire the woman.\"\n\"I did not,\" Zyal replied. \"Her coincidental appearance here only provided the necessary vehicle for my ascension to Shaheership.\"\n\"Dyan is the Shaheer.\"\n\"Dyan is a child!\" Zyal snapped, still absorbed in the Alat. \"I am a man. I am fit to rule.\"\n\"If enough of your people side with you, you will restart the ancient blood feud.\"\n\"No matter. With the Alat, I am more powerful than any army. Now, old man, arrange for Dyan to relinquish his position.\"\n\"No,\" Hu-Jin replied firmly. \"Give me the Ala--\" His words were cut off as a burst of light shot from the crystal, caught him in the chest, and bowled him across the hall. The S.C.U.M. troops raised their weapons. Zyal's troops readied theirs.\n\"That was a warning,\" Zyal announced as Hu-Jin picked himself up with a groan. The Advisor's face darkened. He pulled his sword from its scabbard.\n\"Come face me like a man!\" he shouted.\nZyal laughed at him.\nWith an enraged cry, Hu-Jin sent the large blade soaring through the air at Zyal. A bubble of light appeared around the younger man, and the sword bounced off, skimming across the marble floor until it came to rest some distance away.\n\"Do as I've told you!\" Zyal shouted. \"This is your last warning! Now go!\"\n\"Give me the Alat!\" Hu-Jin seethed.\nZyal eyed his troops. \"Remove these people!\" he ordered.\n\"G'wan and try!\" Mongoe replied. He fired his \"baby\" at the grouping of guards to the left. They vanished, and so did a large portion of the wall behind them, a good deal of furniture in the next room, the wall after that, and the wall after that...\nZyal smiled wickedly as he watched the two factions collide. He wanted this. He wanted another excuse to use the Alat. He wanted to blast them all into eternity with a thought, to watch them die at his fancy. He concentrated harder as the crystal in his hands throbbed. The pleasant, chime-like noises it usually emitted turned to squeals and shrieks. He channeled his anger into the Alat, sending rays of pure hatred out at the battling troops. One of the S.C.U.M. soldiers quite literally exploded, causing him to roar with laughter. Another caught on fire. His aim was off the third time; he managed to disintegrate one of his own men. `No matter,' he thought. `I don't need him--or any of them. I am more powerful than them all.'\nAcross the hall, Quarq found himself pinned facedown on the floor by a man easily twice his size. He fought, kicked, and struggled, but his attacker managed to plant a knee in the back of his neck, pinning him to the floor. The soldier then drew a rifle across his neck and pulled back, throttling him as worked on breaking the lieutenant commander's neck. Quarq got his hands on the rifle and pushed forward as hard as he could in a desperate attempt to stay alive. He looked up and saw Hu-Jin not far away, retrieving his sword.\n\"Advisor!\" he croaked.\nHu-Jin drew near. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, looking rather awkward through his anger, \"I cannot kill him! He is Morin- shan!\"\n\"I think Zyal's already broken the treaty,\" Quarq gasped. \"Help me, damn you!\"\nHu-Jin disappeared.\nQuarq's attacker laughed. \"Relax and I'll snap your neck quickly,\" he sneered. Quarq merely growled and fought on.\nHe did not have to struggle much longer, as Hu-Jin's sword planted itself firmly between the guard's shoulder blades.\n\"Oh, my!\" Hu-Jin said, terribly overacting, \"I seem to have tripped over this poor man, fumbling my weapon with terrible, unfortunate results. What a dreadful accident.\"\nQuarq hauled himself out from under the dead man's body. \"Thanks.\"\nZyal, meanwhile, found that his attacks were becoming increasingly difficult. Every time he used the Alat offensively, there seemed to be a wall blocking the channel through the crystal, a wall which, if he did not concentrate hard enough, would bounce his anger back at him and made his head spin. It was tiring him, but it also made him more determined and more furious. He tried again and again, though each time it became harder to use the Alat. His attacks became weaker and more sporadic.\nSensing Zyal's difficulties, Hu-Jin broke free of the melee and charged him. Zyal saw him coming. A burst of energy tripped the Advisor up, and then a tendril of light wrapped around his legs and arms and dragged him in. Grinning with insane pleasure, Zyal bent over him.\n\"You, old man,\" he growled, \"you I'll kill slowly.\" He put his hand to the Advisor's chest and bore down with his mind. His fingertips began to glow. Still held by the cords of light, Hu-Jin could do no more than stiffen and groan in pain.\n\"Hey!\" Mongoe shouted, bringing his particle acceleration beam to bear on Zyal, \"Let him go!\"\n\"Are you crazy?!\" Haezar cried as he threw off one of Zyal's men, \"If you fire you'll take out the Advisor and the Alat!\"\nWith a sneer, Mongoe fired to the right of Zyal and Hu- Jin. The wide beam melted the wall behind them, then continued on its way through the mansion. \"Next time I'll narrow the beam, and the same'll happen to you!\"\n\"You can't narrow the beam!\" Haezar snapped, cutting down several oncoming guards with a burst of gunfire.\n\"He doesn't know that,\" Mongoe replied.\nZyal, however, did not seem to care. He removed his free hand from Hu-Jin and lashed it out in the lieutenants' general direction. Haezar knocked Mongoe to the floor as a deadly burst of energy scorched the air above them. Satisfied that this would do, Zyal returned his attention to torturing Hu-Jin. Mongoe, Haezar, and Quarq gathered together several troops and rushed the man. Again the defensive bubble rose up around him. Nothing got through, not even lasers. Zyal ignored them all as he worked on killing the Advisor.\n\"This is crazy,\" Quarq growled. \"There's got to be something we can--\" He broke off as his attention fell on the Alat. The crystal was glowing more brightly than any of them had ever seen, no longer throbbing, but with a steady, blinding light.\nEven Zyal seemed startled. \"What the--?\" he began.\n\"STOP!!\" someone called in a shrill voice, and everyone did exactly that. Literally.\nBoth commandoes and security guards froze in their tracks, and stayed that way, unable to move or speak. Confusion played over their features.\nThere came the padding of small feet on marble, and Dyan appeared in the hall, looking very fearsome for someone not quite a decade old.\n\"You leave Hu-Jin alone!\" the boy shrieked. Inside his glowing bubble, Zyal, the only one apparently uneffected by Dyan's command, took his hand off the Advisor. The light bonds vanished as well. Hu-Jin went limp and crumpled to the floor.\n\"You're MEAN!\" Dyan declared. \"You're mean and you take things that don't belong to you!\"\nZyal stood up to his full height. He smiled, then laughed. \"Oh, my,\" he chuckled.\n\"Dyan,\" Hu-Jin groaned, his chest heaving, \"get away from here.\"\n\"I HATE YOU!\" the Shaheer shrieked at Zyal. The Alat began to glow red deep within the blinding light. \"GIVE THE ALAT BACK!\"\nZyal glanced down at Hu-Jin. \"I detest insolent children,\" he said. \"Haven't you taught the boy any manners?\" He paused, chuckled. \"I suppose I'll have to punish him.\"\n\"No!\" the Advisor protested.\n\"Shut up,\" Zyal sneered, and lay his hand on the older man's chest again. Hu-Jin cried out in agony.\n\"I SAID LEAVE HU-JIN ALONE!\" Dyan bellowed at the top of his lungs. The Alat's light throbbed once. Zyal was blown back against the wall, the crystal still in his hand. He picked himself up.\n\"DIE!\" he shouted, and focused every ounce of hate and jealousy in him on the Alat.\nWith Dyan present, the wall he had encountered before now became impenetrable. Some of the energy was absorbed, but not channeled through. The rest bounced back in his face. He screamed as his own mental violence burned his face, chest and arms. He fell to his knees and dropped the Alat.\nThe crystal rose into the air. The frozen soldiers watched in amazement as it floated into the Shaheer's waiting arms. The chime noises were no longer shrieking, but were becoming louder now as the light within the brightness turned from red to rays of yellow and blue.\n\"You'll never be mean to me or Hu-Jin or the Alat again!\" Dyan declared. The blue and yellow lights enveloped Zyal. He cried out once. When the light receded, he was pressed to the wall, curled up and whimpering. The soldiers present suddenly found they could move, but they did not resume their fight. The hall was quiet.\nHaezar helped Hu-Jin up. \"Are you alright?\"\nThe Advisor nodded. \"I think so.\" He went over to Zyal, who shied away as he came.\n\"Get away from me!\" he cried as he cowered, \"Please stay away!\"\n\"It's okay now, Hu-Jin,\" Dyan said. \"I took care of him.\"\n\"What did you do?\" the older man asked.\n\"He's scared now,\" the boy explained. \"Of you, me, and the Alat.\"\n\"You did that?\"\n\"Mm-hm.\"\n\"Good. Very good. And since you didn't kill him, the Yun\/Morin-shan treaty is unbroken. Excellent.\" He went over to the Shaheer and put his arm around the boy's shoulder. \"But you still shouldn't have come here, especially alone.\"\n\"But I told you,\" Dyan protested, \"the Alat was calling me. I had to come.\"\n\"Alright, alright,\" Hu-Jin murmured.\n\"Are you angry?\"\n\"No. Come on, let's go home.\" The Advisor lead Dyan out. Quarq called his troops together and followed.\nMongoe paused on his way out to consider his handiwork, and to attempt to soak in what had just happened. He found it difficult.\n\"In-fucking-credible,\" he muttered, and, shaking his head, followed the others out of the hall.\n9. The Beginning\nThird High Commander Noril's office, several weeks later.\n\"I must compliment you all on the success of your first mission,\" Third High Commander Noril told Quarq, Haezar, and Mongoe. \"The War Council is impressed, and the High Council has decided to give me the funding to expand the S.C.U.M. project further. However,\"--he shot an angry look at Mongoe- -\"there is one more matter to be dealt with.\" Noril paused, looking rather grave. \"I received a very long, very angry complaint by several wealthy families, including Zyal's, among the Qol. According to the complaint, on the day of your hostile encounter with Zyal, a large section of the outer wall surrounding his mansion melted. Melted. Melted and vanished with almost no residue. A pale blue-violet light emerged from the wall, went through the neighbor's wall and every room in their house, continued out through the opposite wall, and halfway through the next neighbor's home before dispersing completely. The same light with the same effects came out of the back of the mansion and went through a couple more homes. Half of Zyal's family mansion, where the light came from, has been gutted.\" Again Noril paused, staring intensely at Mongoe. \"I'd say that sounds like the effects of a particle acceleration beam, wouldn't you, Lieutenant?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Mongoe replied.\n\"Now, I wonder how one of those got into the hands of a S.C.U.M. commando? By my records, the only hand-held particle acceleration weapons were issued to Special Forces for a brief period of time, during which the soldiers using them experienced power failures and self-destruction of the weapons. I believe you're familiar with this, Lieutenant.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"You should be--your platoon was issued them. And coincidentally enough, according to records, you were disciplined over the disappearance of some of the weapons which turned up unaccounted for.\"\n\"Some were lost in battle, sir.\"\n\"I'm sure they were. You have one, don't you?\"\nNo reply.\n\"Someone who worked on the project told me that after the hand-held pieces, they tried making shoulder cannons, but they were too heavy and clumsy for the average soldier. He told me these things were about the size of... oh, I believe he said bazookas. You did bring your bazooka like I asked you to, didn't you?\"\nMongoe held up his carrying case. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Take it out and put it on my desk.\" Mongoe did as told. Noril looked it over. \"What is this thing?\"\n\"It's a bazooka, sir.\"\nThe High Commander toyed with the weapon, looking at it more closely. \"Yes, it is. An old one, too.\" He looked up at the lieutenant, his eyes cold. \"With an almost plugged barrel and that odd addition on the front end.\" He took several tools from his desk, pried open the back of the weapon, and began tearing parts, insulation, and padding out of it. \"What is this?\" he demanded, gesturing to the array of parts on the desk.\n\"It's... it's the modified remains of several particle acceleration guns,\" Mongoe muttered.\n\"I see.\" Noril looked at Quarq. \"And you didn't notice anything peculiar?\"\n\"I... I didn't realize what it was, sir.\"\n\"Why is it that in your report you write that several mansions, including Zyal's, were damaged, but you don't say by what?\"\n\"I wasn't sure what it was, sir.\"\nNoril scowled. \"Mongoe, Quarq--I could fry both your asses over this--especially you, Lieutenant! But I'm not going to. Not now, anyway.\"\n\"Sir?\" Quarq replied.\n\"If I dismiss and discipline you now, it'll make me look bad. I thought I was dealing with three--well, at least two--highly disciplined officers, and so did the War Council. They're under the impression that everything went smoothly. I want to keep it that way. If I dismiss any of you now for improper conduct, my whole project could be scrapped.\" Noril turned to Quarq. \"You--I'll overlook your error. Your record's clean. Between you and me, we'll say Mongoe here kept the damn thing on your blind side the whole time. As for you,\" he went on to Mongoe, \"you watch yourself. Durn just barely managed to convince me to let you in. One more foul-up, in any way, and I'll see you court-martialled. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Quarq and Mongoe replied.\n\"You and Haezar keep an eye on this shithead, Quarq.\" Noril picked up the bazooka casing and shoved it into Mongoe's arms. \"Get rid of this,\" he snarled. \"Dismissed.\"\nLate that night, Mongoe sat in his quarters, the remains of his \"baby\" on his lap. He didn't have the heart to dispose of it. He stroked the barrel affectionately and sighed, then set the weapon down on the bed.\nHe got onto the floor and reached underneath his bed, digging through the assorted junk, gear, and boxes. At last he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a box, taped shut and addressed as if it were to be mailed, and cut it open. After digging through the styrofoam bits and tissue paper, he reached in and smiled.\nHe pulled out two large, awkward-looking, hand-held particle acceleration guns.\n`Yeah,' he thought as he sat down next to the old bazooka casing and went to work, `I think I'm gonna like this job.'\nFaye Levine is a Freshman in Carnegie Mellon University's Art\/Design core program.

McWhinney\nCopyright (c) 1992\nThe Red Dragon Inn is a good place to be if you need time to think. King Roland's soldiers don't often venture very far into this part of the city, even during daylight. Some of the people up in the Royal Quarter call this area Jester's Quarter, but only when they're not here. There's nothing funny down here. Nothing at all. That's what makes it a good place to be when you need to think, and tonight I do.\nFor months, rumors have been filtering into town about an elfin wizard who has been stirring up trouble in the Southern Forest. Three days ago, a messenger from one of the outlying territories came to the city demanding an audience with the King. This morning, the sound of hammers forging steel into weapons could be heard at every smithy in Tradesman's Quarter. The possibility of war is all too real. I'm thinking of going north, out the city, maybe out of the Realm. It's not that I mind killing, it's just that I prefer to do it on my own terms, alone, and for gold.\nI'm leaning back in a chair, with my back against the wall and my feet on the table in front of me. The people around me probably think that I'm staring at my boots, drunk or lost in thought.\nI am thinking, that's for sure, and in a way, I guess that I am staring at my boots. That doesn't mean that I don't know what's going on around me.\nOver at the bar, a short figure in a long cloak just slid a small pouch to the barkeep The barkeep pocketed the pouch, nodded toward me, and turned away.\nThe stranger in the cloak is coming this way. I can see him right over the tip of my boot. He'll probably think that these worn old boot have seen better days. I disagree. When I was nineteen, I stole these boots from the house of an assassin. They've served me much better than they did their original owner.\nWhen I think of the boots, I smile, but only for a second. smiling changes the youthful look of my face. It shows a few of the wrinkles and scars that I've collected over the last thirty some years. That will never do. In my business, appearances are everything.\nThe stranger in the cloak is about five paces away. That's close enough.\n\"What?,\" I say in a flat monotone.\nHe's staring at me now, straining to make out my features. I know exactly what he's seeing, just a dark figure leaning back in a chair. More of an outline that anything else.\nHe takes a step closer, around the table, and to my right.\n\"I won't ask again stranger,\" I say, a hint of menace in my voice.\n\"A thousand pieces of gold to talk outside,\" he says.\n\"You don't have that kind of gold with you stranger.\" \"Gems,\" he says, as he pulls aside his cloak.\nThere's a pouch tied at his belt. It's bulging with something. Probably gems considering that the barkeep hasn't killed him yet.\n\"What's to stop me from taking those stranger?\" I ask.\nHe shrugs indifferently. \"I suppose you could try.\" Time to teach this fool a lesson.\nBefore he can move, I leap at him. The boots make it easy despite my awkward position.\nI slip a dagger out of my sleeve as I move. It's nearly at his throat when something solid smashes into my groin. I vomit as I'm slammed back into my chair.\nWhen the nausea passes, I look up. The air in front of me is shimmering, taking shape. The shape of...a man.\n\"Sorry I had to do it his way Thaldon,\" the shimmering figure purrs. \"Go with him.\"\nI know the voice.\n\"Dangar?\" I croak, as the apparition fades.\nThe cloaked stranger turns and walks away.\nI scan the crowd as I follow him to he door on unsteady legs. No one seems to have noticed what just happened. What in all the cursed god's names is happening here? Dangar's been gone for well over ten years. Who's under that cloak? Why hasn't anyone noticed any of this?\nThe cloaked figure leaves the tavern and keeps walking. He doesn't look back. I follow. He goes a good fifty paces with me at his heels.\nAbruptly, he turns and speaks, \"I am Rendell, a follower of Dangar, Mage of the Southern Forest. I have been sent to ask you to meet with the Mage on a matter he thinks you will find interesting and profitable.\"\nHe opens his cloak and takes the pouch from his belt. I can hear the faint tinkle of gems touching. Slowly, he tosses the pouch toward me.\nIn one smooth motion, I catch it and slip it into my tunic. catch it and slip it into my tunic in one smooth motion.\n\"Another thousand if you follow me to the meeting place,\" Rendell says.\n\"Meeting place?\"\n\"Two days ride south. Dangar is there.\"\n\"Gems first.\"\nHe tosses me another pouch. I bounce it in my hand. Judging by the way it feels, I'm willing to bet that it's full of gems. I tuck it away with the other.\n\"I've got two horses near the south gate,\" he says.\n\"Lead on,\" I reply.\nWe reach the south gate without incident. The horses are fresh and strong. We mount in silence and leave the gate at a fast trot. The evening is still young, the gate guards pay us little mind.\nIt's late when we reach a small grove some miles from the city. He dismounts and says, \"Let the horses graze, they won't stray far....\"\nI spread a blanket at the base of a large oak. I like to have a good, solid thing like that at my back. I'll sleep well. I don't have to worry about Rendell. I'll be on my feet, dagger in hand, at the snap of a single twig, one of the benefits of training and experience.\n\"We leave at first light,\" he says, as lays down on his blanket.\nI wake just before dawn and nudge Rendell with my boot.\n\"There's food in the packs on the horses,\" he says.\nThe horses are nearby. I get the food and we eat in silence. We're back on the road quickly. We ride till late in the night, stopping only briefly to rest and water the horses. There's little traffic on the road, and none but us headed south.\nHalfway through the next day, we leave the road and pick our way through the woods. The going is slow. As the last light of day is fading, we top a small rise. There is a camp just over the far side. Armed elves meet us as we near the camp.\n\"The Mage will be with you soon,\" one of them says.\nI scan the camp, taking stock, and count maybe ten elves, a dozen horses, and a half dozen mules. A half dozen sacks lay beside the mules.\nA tall thin figure is leaving the camp and moving towards us. I recognize Dangar as he gets closer. Fifteen years have not changed his looks. Elfin folk can live to be over a hundred.\n\"Thaldon my friend, it has been a long time,\" he says.\nI nod. \"It has.\"\n\"My apology for the incident at the Inn,\" he continues. Your reputation marks you as a dangerous man. I didn't want you to kill Rendell.\"\n\"I wouldn't say dangerous,\" I reply, looking toward the guards and then back at Dangar.\n\"Thaldon,\" he chuckles. \"Modesty has never suited you. You're the best assassin in the entire Realm. I know. I've heard the tales and talked to the people. Even Daldes says that you're the best.\"\n\"Assassin?\" I ask, again looking toward the guards and then back at Dangar. \"I've been called a lot of things but, never that.\"\n\"You worry needlessly my friend,\" he says. \"They can't hear a word we say. I've taken care of that.\"\nI nod, standing so that I can see both Dangar and the guards. If they can hear us, they don't show it.\n\"Daldes is a corpse,\" I say.\n\"Of course he is,\" Dangar replies. \"You snuck past his guard, foiled not one but three magical traps, slipped a poisoned dagger neatly into his chest, and stole his boots. And that was over ten years ago. With the practice you've had since then, you're almost unstoppable. That's the only reason the assassin's guild hasn't killed you. They don't permit rogues like you to operate outside their guidelines...unless they can't stop you. The rumors say that you killed two of their men who tried.\"\nI keep my face blank, concealing my surprise. \"You're well informed. Am I supposed to guess at your fortunes or will you tell me those too?\"\n\"Ah... Thaldon. There is so much to tell, but I'll be brief. We must get to the business at hand. When Goldsen lost the crown and our families fell from grace, my family fled south. Elfin blood made us welcome, fortune made me a mage. Ambition made me a leader. I've united all ten elfin settlements in the Southern Forest. We're ready to expand. I want the Realm. I've never forgotten what happened when dear Roland's father took the crown. He made me an outcast. Now I'm ready to be a king.\"\n\"Where's my place in this?\"\n\"You,\" he says, \"are in need of a new beginning. I am here to give you that chance. It's time you quit living in the slums and return to the life you knew, we both knew, in our youth.\"\n\"Go on.\"\n\"Do you see the sacks by the mules?\" he asks. They are full of gold. A fortune by any standard. Enough for you to buy respectability and live as you please, anywhere. The gold is yours if you kill Roland.\"\nHe holds my gaze, looking for a reaction.\n\"How much time do I have?\" I ask.\n\"Three days, maybe a week. As we speak, Roland is meeting with his Lords in the palace. He will ask for a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. Once they swear loyalty, he will announce that the forces of the Realm will march on the Southern Forest to quell the elfin insurrection. I want him dead before his army marches.\"\nHe pauses. I review his words in my mind. Kill Roland...\n\"You see,\" he continues. \"Roland and I are very much alike. He has under his command, the united forces of the Lords of the Realm. I control the combined forces of the elfin settlements. Roland has no rightful heir. When he dies the Lords will battle for the power. They will form allegiances, the strongest of which will put a king on the throne. If I should die, the elfin coalition will dissolve.\"\nA look of irritation crosses his face. He falls silent, running a hand through his hair.\n\"Thaldon... You must understand, I am not a tyrant. I do not wish to terrorize the subjects of the Realm, I wish to be their king. I want the Realm and the Southern Forest to form a vast, powerful, united territory. For this to happen, Roland must die.\"\nI smile. \"A fortune in gold is not easily passed up by one in my position and profession.\"\nDangar nods. \"I will leave here when you do. I will return in three days time and remain for one week. When the deed is done, return here for your gold.\"\n\"I'll need five thousand croats before I leave.\"\n\"Take a sack,\" he answers, nodding toward the mules.\n\"I'd prefer gems.\"\n\"Gems?\" he questions.\n\"I do this my way, no questions.\"\nNodding, he turns away muttering as he rubs his temples.\nOne of the guards Jogs back toward the camp.\n\"He'll fetch them,\" Dangar says as he turns back toward me.\n\"When I return,\" I say, \"I will not look as I do now. Do not be alarmed if I look younger. Much younger. And please, keep the guards close to camp. I don't want many people to see the man who killed the King.\"\n\"I'll wait with only two men,\" he smiles. \"My magic will protect us while we wait, and when it is time to leave this camp, only the two of us will ride away.\"\nThe guard approaches. Dangar weaves a pattern in the air with his fingers. \"Thank You Ogden,\" he says, as the guard hands him a half full sack.\nHe hands me the sack. I open it to find four sizable pouches, all are full of gems. I nod and close the sack.\n\"Fair enough. I ride at dawn, but for now, I rest.\"\nHe nods.\nI walk to my horse, unpack the blanket and spread it on the ground.\n\"Rest well my friend,\" he says, walking back toward his camp.\nI note that two elves are on guard duty before I let myself sleep.\nI wake before the others. I pack and leave in silence. If I ride hard through the night, I can reach the city by noon tomorrow.\nAfter two hours on the main road, I overtake a small band of travelers. They have an old wagon packed full of their belongings. As I pass, an older man looks toward me and smiles a grim smile.\n\"Riding that fast, I'd have to say that your fleeing the elves too,\" he calls out.\nI reign in to keep pace with the wagon.\n\"The city seems like a safe place to be now eh?\" I reply.\n\"I hope,\" he says. \"They've got the lands bordering the forest. I've never seen such butchery. My wife... in the wagon... they... \" he stops as sobs wrack his body. \"I... I hope she lives,\" he sobs.\nI drop back and in look in the wagon. The bed is black with dried blood. The cloth wrapped figure lying there looks dead already. It has only one arm. A slow trickle of blood seeps from bandages on the bloody stump.\nI spur my horse into a gallop and pass the wagon without another word. War is so ugly. Not at all like what I do. I don't torture and maim. When I kill, I do it quickly and with honor. It is not random murder. Women and children are not butchered. Men are not killed for sport. Dangar's wishes may be good, but solders are difficult to work with. Things get sloppy. People die.\nThe night passes quickly on the road. The horse is panting heavily. It won't survive this trip, but I knew it wouldn't. A small sacrifice in the name of time. It 1S important to reach the city quickly. Time is short. If the price on Roland's head weren't so high, I'd demand more time to plan this.\nFour more hours on the road and the horse is stumbling. It doesn't matter, we're close now. I dismount and walk the horse into the woods beside the road. I dispatch him quickly. With the sack of gems over my shoulder, I walk the rest of the way to the city, arranging myself along the way. A little dirt here and there, a few tears in the shirt and cloak, sad eyes, and hunched back. I look old and tired by the time I reach the city. It is just past noon.\nIn Merchants Quarter, I buy a new cloak and a bit to eat. Back in the Commons, I go to Tenbro's Ale House.\nThe barkeep raises his eyebrows in question, when I come in.\n\"A tankard of ale?\" he asks.\nI shake my head. \"Aardo.\"\nHe nods and walks off. I sit at the bar. A few minutes later, the barkeep returns. A stout man with a big barrel chest follows him.\n\"Aardo,\" I smile.\nHe circles the bar and gives me a hug. Aardo is a good man. He runs a brothel, but also lets friends looking for a quiet place use the rooms.\n\"A room,\" I whisper.\n\"Ah my friend,\" he bellows,\" as he straightens up. \"It is good to see you.\" He slips me a key as he clasps my hand.\n\"I must go, but I wanted to see you first,\" I say. \"I'll be back tonight.\"\nHe laughs. \"I'll be waiting my friend.\"\nI leave the Ale House and circle to the rear. The boarding brothel isn't far. There's a private entrance to every room in the building. I slip in unnoticed. There's a lot that I need to find out, but sleep comes first. The sack of gems serves as a pillow.\nIt's mid-evening by the time I wake. I empty the sack onto the bed and spread the gems out evenly. With the sheet pulled up, they'll go unnoticed unless someone sits on the bed. That won't happen here. I toss my old cloak on the table to ward off any unexpected intruders. No one violates privacy at Aardo's.\nIn Merchant's Quarter, I stop at the Cavalier Tavern, and take a small table near the bar. I eat and I listen. Young aristocrats frequent this place. They know no discretion. I almost chuckle thinking about it. I wouldn't fit in with these people anymore, even if I wasn't an outlaw. Twenty years in Common Quarter changes a man.\n\"I say he'll announce tomorrow,\" a tall fellow toting a long-sword screams at the fat knight next to him.\n\"And just how would you know so much stable boy? I'm one of Lord Tengrill's knights and I've heard no such rubbish.\"\n\"Well brave knight, not two hours ago, this groom just happens to have brushed the King's horse and polished his leathers.\"\n\"I'll drink to the King,\" the knight replies.\nTheir words nearly choke me. I've got to move, now. I finish my meal quickly and make haste to Common Quarter. In an ill lit and foul smelling cellar, I find the man I need.\n\"A dagger Rexan,\" I say to the young dwarf. He's fifty years old, but dwarves often live to two hundred. youngster, he's got connections.\n\"Fifteen hundred croats\".\n\"Fifteen hundred? You must think I'm a fool.\"\n\"Fifteen hundred. I've got a cache that just came in from the south. Elfin steel, blessed with farie fire. The best.\"\n\"From the south?\"\nHe smiles a curious little smile. \"Dwarven folk don't kin with the elves, as you know, but the elves are coming and magic rides in their stead. The elves are going sack this city when they defeat Roland. I'm leaving by weeks end.\"\n\"Defeat? Roland has the strength of the Realm behind him. His forces number in the tens of thousands.\"\nHe frowns and lowers his gaze to the floor.\n\"Roland will lose.\"\n\"Lose?\"\n\"Cromwell hasn't come to the palace.\"\nI stand quiet, shocked by the news. Cromwell holds the largest Barony in the Realm. His forces nearly match those of the King. If Cromwell doesn't march, the other Lords will balk. They'll ride home to protect their lands.\n\"That's not the worst,\" he says. \"The southern mage bears a half moon on the back of his left hand. He follows Togi, God of Black Arts.\"\nI'm confused. \"Black Arts?\" I thought elven magic is pure, derived from nature.\"\n\"Most is, but not all,\" he replies. \"Those that follow Togi make sacrifices for their power. In times of war, they collect the left arms of their victims and burn them to gain Togi's blessing. When the mage comes, this city'll be a blood bath.\"\nAn image of the woman in the wagon flashes in my mind. Dangar's words echo in my head... You must understand. I am not a tyrant. He and I were friends, but we were children then. Still, I have no reason to disbelieve him. I rode off with seven thousand croats worth of his gems, but I know better than to take chances.\n\"Rexan, I'll take two daggers.\"\nHis eyes gleam. \"Three thousand croats.\"\nGreedy little dwarf' Fifteen hundred for the pair.\"\n\"You rob me' Twenty five hundred.\"\n\"Two thousand.\"\nHe shrugs. \"If I wasn't leaving town, I'd send you away empty handed thief, but under these conditions, I'll sacrifice.\"\nI hand over my two small gem pouches.\nHe pulls a pair of finely crafted daggers from under a nearby counter, and holds them out, pommels facing me. When I take them, he points to a battered helmet lying on a nearby table. \"Test them on that,\" he says.\nI flip the daggers around, so that the blades face me. They feel good. Perfectly balanced. I throw them both at once. They strike the helmet side by side and sink to their hilts.\nI sigh. \"Impressive steel.\"\n\"The best,\" he says.\nBack in my room, I take the gems from he bed and put them back in the sack. I review my plan. I'll make the hit in Royal Square. It's right out in the open, but it's also very predictable. The Royal entourage always enters the square in exactly the same way. All but two of the King's escorts ride to the stage with him. While the speech is given, the two escorts not at the stage wait about forty paces away in the street. The whole city understands. As long as those guards stay in the street, the citizens leave enough space for the King and his escort to leave the Square. This is done to aid the King should he need a quick escape from the Square. It will provides the perfect escape route for a bold assassin.\nWhen the bed i5 clear of gems, I tuck a few into my tunic, take off my boots and lie down. I've got a lot of things to do by noon tomorrow.\nI wake early and put on the tattered cloak. It has four leather scabbards sewn into it to conceal my daggers. I replace the two daggers hidden in the left side of the cloak with the two I bought from Rexan. I prefer to throw right handed, and don't want to waste time fumbling with the cloak should I need the second dagger. I use light twine to tie one of the original daggers to my left wrist. I cover it with the sleeve of my cloak. The twine will snap easily enough if I need the dagger. It always has before. The other dagger is used to pin the sack of gems to wall beside the door. Anyone opening the door won't find the gems unless the come into the room and closes the door. Not a very tricky hiding place, but it doesn't have to be. This is Aardo's place. I shave and cut my hair. That and a few other tricks make me look quite a bit younger.\nWhen I leave the room, I go to Royal Square. I stroll through slowly, pretending to watch the carpenters finish the stage. The first alley way in Royal Quarter is only two hundred paces from the stage. Once I there, it's no hard task to reach Common Quarter. Satisfied, I stop at nearby ale house for a bit to eat. It's still early, but I eat quickly. The people will gather for the announcement several hours before the arrival of the King.\nWhen I reach the Square again, there are already many people waiting. I take position about ten short paces from the stage, careful to keep near where the clear lane will be formed.\nI watch the crowd and wait. All is as it should be. I stay watchful but relaxed. Two hours pass quickly as the Square fills. A fat man stops beside me as the royal entourage enters the square. There isn't time or space to work my way around him. I just have to deal with him when the time comes. Things are going to happen quickly, 50 I don't want to attract any attention right now.\nRoland and his escort of Lords ride solemnly to the stage. Cromwell and several others are missing. The King dismounts and takes the stage. His Lords dismount and take their places beside him. A quiet comes over the crowd as all eyes fix on Roland.\n\"My people,\" he begins. He says a word or two more, but I don't hear. I scan the open lane. The escort has drawn up, facing away from the stage. All is perfect. I draw and throw the first dagger in a single motion.\nIt takes Roland in the throat. His word disappear in a splash of crimson as I smash my left forearm into the face of the fat man beside me. The weight of the dagger breaks his Jaw. I I easily knock him to the ground as I rush past.\nThe crowd is still as I charge into the open lane. I can feel my heart pound as I race toward the mounted escort. I'm nearly there when a leg darts out of the crowd and smashes into my shin. I roll as I fall and come up running.\nA few steps later, I feel a tug on the back of my cloak. I glance back to see an angry man in pursuit. This has to stop. I tear the dagger from my left wrist and flip it at my pursuer. It buries itself in his chest and he falls to the ground.\nThe horseman is in front of my now. He's still facing away. I pull out the second dagger from the left side of my cloak. With a leap, I'm on the horse and plunging the dagger into the soldier. The fine elfin blade never slows as it passes through his mail shirt and sinks into flesh. A strong kick and the horse starts running.\nAs I turn into the first alley, I risk a look back. The other horseman is far back, but charging my way. He's too late. I'll never be caught in these streets. Quickly and easily, I make my way across the city. The guards never stir as I saunter casually out of the south gate.\nOn the road south, I pass many people headed toward the city. There are many stories about the elves. None of them are good.\nNear dusk on the second day, I near Dangar's camp. I tether the horse a short distance away and approach the camp slowly. Dangar is there with two others and the mule train. I circle the camp to be sure that no others are hidden nearby. When I'm satisfied, I step from cover and call to Dangar.\n\"I trust it is done,\" he says.\n\"It is done.\"\n\"Good.\"\nHe turns to his companions. \"Pack the mules and saddle the horses.\"\nWe stand in silence and watch the men. As they finish up, Dangar motions for me to follow, and moves behind the elves. He begins to mumble under under his breath and raises his hands over his head. As the elves fall to the ground, I see a red crescent etched on the back of Dangar's hand. My dagger slips easily into his back. He dies quickly.\nIt has now been three months since I killed Roland. Cromwell sits on the throne. The Kings soldiers still avoid some part of Common Quarter. The elfin insurrection has fallen apart. The Red Dragon i5 still a good place to be if you need time to think. I'm there now, sitting at my usual table in the corner. Dangar was wrong when he said that I should return to the life I knew in my youth. I has been too many years and too many things have changed.\n\"Thaldon,\" a gruff voice calls.\nI look up with a grin as a balding older man approaches. \"Yes, Yando?\"\n\"What kind of proprietor are you? Ever since I sold you the Dragon all you do is sit in that damn corner.\"\nJames E. McWhinney is a Pennsylvania native, born in Pittsburgh PA in 1969.

The trail itself was remarkable only in that it appeared well used, for it was a good distance off of any road and practically inaccessible overland. The woman had herself had arrived via helicopter to a small clearing some ways down the mountain.\nAfter a time she seated herself on a rock, pulled a sandwich from a coat pocket, and began to eat, never ceasing her relentless scan of the surrounding terrain. Thus, she saw the hiker approach without his seeing her. A quick examination led her to believe he was no more than what he appeared, and she resumed eating. A soft peal of thunder rolled up the mountain a moment later, and her eyes snapped back to the hiker. He was no longer there, leaving the trail as empty as it had been most of the day.\n\"Damn,\" she muttered under her breath, and began the easy descent to where she had seen him last. Reaching it, she sat down again and waited.\nThe wait paid off about an hour later when the hiker reappeared in a flash of light that made her grin with some private joke.\n\"You need to work on that, kiddo.\" The hiker stiffened and spun at the sound of her voice.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"Currently, a damsel in distress. I need to get into the Academy. I've found the ventilation shafts, but doors seem to be a commodity you folks don't have.\"\n\"Of course not. What use is a door to...\" He halted, uncertain, tried to look stern. \"Just who are you?\"\n\"I'm not a Teletrix, obviously. Would you be so kind as to take me in?\"\nHe still looked uncertain. \"I'm just a student, I don't think I can do that. But I'll tell Mr. Morlen that you're here. What did you say your name was?\"\n\"June Kendall.\"\nHe was obviously nervous; the peal of thunder that rolled down the mountain at his disappearance made June's head hurt. By contrast, Anthony Morlen's appearance, a few minutes later, was silent. A tall man in a business suit, he merely WAS, where a moment before he was not.\nAnthony smiled \"Good day, Mrs. Kendall. I apologize for keeping you waiting out here, but we had no idea you were coming. Why didn't you just call? We could have brought you here quite easily, you know.\"\n\"I needed the fresh air and I like flying.\" She gestured expansively. \"And the mountains are beautiful this time of year.\" She paused, fixed her gaze firmly on him. \"Are you going to invite me in?\"\nAnthony looked around, as if just now noticing their surrounding. He smiled, and a moment later, they stood in a plush office. He sat behind the heavy desk, motioned for June to take a seat as well.\n\"How can I help you?\" His smile, if not handsome, was at least sincere. June didn't smile at all.\n\"I want to know where Martin is. I haven't seen him for two weeks. No phone call, nothing. Last time I saw him, he was on his way here.\"\nAnthony didn't lose his smile, but his face showed concern as well. \"It's strange that he wouldn't call. But I'm afraid that he's on Academy business, and I can't tell you where he is. Rules, you know.\"\n\"Damn your rules. I think something's happened to him.\"\n\"I'm sure he's just fine. Quite sure.\"\nJune relaxed, sat back a little bit. \"All right, all right. Can you get a message to him?\"\nAnthony nodded, June continued. \"Just ask him to call home as soon as he can.\"\n\"I will, but it may be a while. Can I do anything else for you?\"\n\"Yes, as a matter of fact. You could feed me dinner. My husband is always raving about the food here.\"\nAnthony smiled broadly. \"Then he was indeed raving. But I'll arrange it immediately. One moment.\" He vanished.\nJune was up instantly, crossing the room to the large file cabinet on the wall. It was locked tight, in that annoying habit of the Teletrix, but she produced a lockpick from a pocket and opened it in a few seconds.\nActing quickly, she emptied the folder labeled \"Kendall, Martin\" into her knapsack, filled it with papers pulled randomly from nearby folders, and closed the drawer.\nShe was back in the chair before Anthony reappeared.\nBy the time the helicopter landed at a friend's private airfield, she was completely familiar with the contents of the folder, including the short addition. \"Wife: June Kendall, Chemistry Teacher, Springfield High. Harmless.\" She was somewhat amazed at the number of missions her husband ran for the academy -- almost a dozen in the last year alone. She had thought his connection with the academy almost nonexistent, and knew of his distaste for the administration that ran it. Not for the first time, she wondered just how powerful the academy and its rather special graduates were.\nAs for Martin himself, the folder placed him in Glasgow, investigating the disappearance of several Teletrix there. Anthony Morlen had lied about at least one point; the folder listed his status as \"missing, whereabouts unknown.\" She forced herself rather sternly to remain calm. The folder was remarkably sparse on details.\nShe took her friend's car to her home, parked across the street, observing her house. After a short time, she saw someone moving in the living room. June started the car, and drove away.\nA few minutes later, she pulled up in front of the Springfield High School and let herself in with the master key. The halls were deserted; apparently Anthony had not sent anyone here to intercept her. A storeroom door covered with \"DANGER\" signs opened to her key, as did a small refrigerated chest in the back. From the rows of chemical vials therein, she selected about two dozen, placing them with some others in a protected case in her knapsack.\nBefore leaving, she placed a long distance collect call. Anthony's voice came on the other end. She cut him off.\n\"Nice try. You can tell the dudes in my house to forget it. I won't be attending their party. And if anything has happened to Martin...\" She let the threat trail off, hung up before he could answer.\nLess than 24 hours later she stepped off a bus in Glasgow. She had taken rather a roundabout path to get here, since the Academy appeared to be taking an active interest in her, but she had little problem getting a flight; money talks loudly, and June Kendall talked fast. She got lucky going through customs, her handbag was not searched, the chemicals in the false bottom remained undiscovered.\nHer first stop was in a small hotel on the opposite side of town from the one in which Martin supposedly resided. She got a room without difficulty, a fairly small but modern one, comfortable but not plush enough to attract attention. The innkeeper's accent amused her briefly, her attempt to mimic it back was apparently successful; the Scottish dialect was familiar to her from several vacations with Martin. The thought of him kept her moving quickly, but with caution. It had taken her hours to cross the sea; if a Teletrix found her snooping, it would take less than a second to make the return trip.\nSafely in her room, she spread out an array of bottles and vials, and looked them over carefully. It took only a few minutes to mix the concoctions she needed.\nWhen she emerged from her room an hour later, no one would have recognized her. Her usually-light hair was a burgundy so deep it would pass for black, tied in a fashion different from her usual style. All of her visible skin had been lightened by several shades. A short stop to a local clothing shop completed her change. In her new purse, three vials of a light powder were carefully protected from jarring.\nIn this guise she approached Martin's hotel. It was a larger structure than the one in which she had decided to stay, several stories high and built of attractive red brick. She scanned the outside briefly, then entered. The lobby contained various brochures and posters, and several large stuffed chairs. Two of them were occupied by men reading; one paid no attention at all to her, the second surveyed her briefly as she entered, then looked back to his book. He might be innocent; then again, he might be a Teletrix. Careful not to show too much of her face to him, she sat down in the seat next to him and opened her purse. Carefully, she dumped one of the vials of powder into her makeup kit, then withdrew it. The man next to her continued his reading, but looked up to scan each new arrival in the room.\nShe took a small brush out of the makeup case as if to apply the powder to her face, but sneezed violently instead. The man next to her looked up at the sneeze, brushing away the cloud of dust that had formed about him. June grinned shyly, hiding her face and holding her breath until the cloud settled. He mumbled something and went back to his reading. A few seconds later, as the sleep powder took effect, his head dropped back in the chair.\nJune looked around. The incident had not disturbed the other reader, and passing guests had abandoned the lobby for rooms within. She approached the desk and rang the bell.\nA short man approached and politely asked how she could be helped.\n\"I'm looking for Martin Kendall. I'm his wife, and I understand he has a room here.\"\nThe clerk's eyes snapped briefly to the sleeping man in the chair. June noticed.\n\"I'd really rather you didn't tell that man I'm here. I know he wanted you to watch out for me, but he's certainly not a friend of mine.\" She slid a few pound notes across the table to him.\nThe clerk pushed them back. \"That isn't necessary. I didn't really like his attitude anyhow.\" The clerk signalled for a bellhop, handed him a key. The bellhop accepted it, vanished.\n\"Mr. Kendall has not checked in, but he called and said to hold that room for him, and that he'd be back in a couple of days. This was about two weeks ago, though.\"\n\"And that man?\" June prompted.\n\"He said he was a friend of Mr. Kendall, sent to meet his wife when she arrived. I was supposed to point you out to him.\"\nJune nodded. \"Thanks for not giving me away.\"\n\"Are you in some sort of trouble? I could call the police and have him removed.\" The man seemed genuinely concerned.\nJune grinned at the thought of a Teletrix in jail. \"It wouldn't do any good. Besides, it would let him know I'm here.\"\nThe clerk shrugged, but his eyes said that he didn't approve of her decision. \"If you need help, don't hesitate to let me know. The bellhop should be making up your husband's room now, so you should be ready in a few...\"\nA tremendous explosion shook the building, pulling pictures down from the walls and throwing both June and the clerk to the floor. Beams split from the ceiling, raining debris down upon the occupants of the lounge. June rolled under the desk as a rafter crashed down where she had been standing. The clerk looked at her from the other side his eyes wide with confusion and fear; she gestured at him to cover his head, then did so herself without waiting to see if he complied.\nAfter a few long moments the rubble ceased and the constant rain of debris turned to a lingering cloud of dust. She pulled herself up, and shortly realized that reaching the door would now be impossible, but there appeared little immediate danger and plenty of air, so she settled back to wait for rescue.\nOnly seconds later a human figure emerged from the air, looking around with a look of shock on his face. June recognized him at once.\n\"Martin!\"\nMartin Kendall immediately turned in the direction of her voice.\n\"June? Are you okay?\" The piles of rubble around her vanished without a trace, fresh air wafted over her. Martin himself covered the distance in a few short steps, taking her into his arms as she stood. The clerk behind them stood up uncertainly, shaking his clothes to clear them of dust. Martin nodded briefly in the clerk's direction, then led June around a ceiling beam that jutted out nearby.\nThe moment they were obscured from the clerk's vision, the ruined hotel ceased to exist, replaced by a plushly furnished room. Martin gestured toward one of the chairs, seated himself in the other.\n\"Good morning,\" he said, without a trace of humor in his voice. There was an implied question in the tone.\n\"Came looking for you. What's going on?\"\nMartin shrugged. \"I wish I knew. Fifteen Teletrix have disappeared here in the last couple months. Inexperienced ones seem to vanish from the Earth, more powerful ones are murdered. The explosion you just, uh, experienced was probably a bomb in my \"reserved\" room. I took this one instead under an assumed name when I got here.\"\n\"How would they know where you were going to be?\"\n\"Apparently the people responsible have access to the Academy's records. Since you managed to find me, I have to guess that those records aren't as secure as they might be.\" He grinned.\nJune extracted his file from the remains of her tote, tossed it to the table. \"Anthony figured it out, of course. He's been chasing me down since I got them.\"\nMartin nodded. \"Probably for your protection. Whatever game is going on here is quite dangerous. He's a good man, if a bit sticky on the rules sometimes.\"\n\"Apparently. I take it that this is why you didn't call home?\"\n\"Exactly. I want my file to read `missing.' I'd rather have people believe me dead. Sorry I couldn't let you know, but I'm being very careful. For a while I even suspected that these people had a device that could detect teleportation, so I didn't want to risk a hop home.\"\n\"You don't think so any more?\"\n\"No. I'm fairly sure I was found more as a result of impeccable record- keeping on the part of Anthony. Any Teletrix who knew where those records were located could get a hold of them at any time.\"\n\"You think it's a Teletrix?\"\n\"Who else would know of our existence? Or care enough to try to kill us? And the murders have all succeeded, with the exception of mine. It's very hard to kill a Teletrix - you have to do it almost instantly, and so unexpectedly that they cannot react. Usually it's been bombs.\"\nHe reached under the nightstand, pulled out several manila folders. \"Here's everything I've been able to come up with on the cases. Some of this is information Anthony gave me before I left, most of it I gathered myself from police reports. I can't find anything in it, but maybe I'm looking too hard. Take a peek yourself and tell me if you can find anything I missed.\"\nJune shook her head, and a small cloud of dust dropped off it. \"A shower first, I think. Care to join me?\"\nTeacher\nJune Kendall saw the young blond woman standing by the luggage claim, and carefully eased a syringe out of her purse. The maneuver was almost too easy; she slid the needle into the blond woman's leg, then had it back in her purse before anyone could notice. The blond woman spun around quickly at the sharp pain, her eyes going wide.\n\"Sorry,\" June said, a moment before the blond woman slumped into her arms.\n\"She seems to have fainted,\" June said aloud, \"give me some room.\" Carefully supporting her unconscious burden, she backed out of the crowd and headed for the ladies room. Several people offered to help, but she turned them down. \"This happens all the time to her, all it takes is some cold water to bring her back.\"\nAcross the wide aisle, Martin Kendall waited until the bathroom door closed, then teleported them all back to the hotel.\n\"Nice job,\" he said. \"How long will that keep her out?\"\n\"Only a few minutes, but I'll give her something before she wakes up to keep her asleep for eight to ten hours.\" Even as she spoke, she was filling her hypodermic with a clear liquid.\nThey waited several minutes until the woman's breathing slowed to almost imperceptible, then stripped her quickly, wrapping her in a hotel bathrobe. June quickly dressed in her clothes, making an occasional adjustment to cover the relatively poor fit. Martin arranged June's hair as closely as they could to the blond woman's style.\n\"Why would a Teletrix take a plane, anyhow?\", she said as he worked.\n\"Probably she doesn't have enough experience to leap overseas, or she's never been here before. Or maybe Anthony's working on my teleport detection theory.\"\n\"He certainly doesn't protect his files any better.\" Martin had teleported the files here earlier, allowing them to meet the young woman at the airport. They had been returned equally easily. Since the woman had arrived on schedule, Anthony had not noticed the absence.\nAn hour later, June was back on the street, Martin following at a cautious distance, maintaining a teleportation \"shield\" around her. They walked several blocks without incident, arriving at last at a small inn.\n\"Marie Jacobsen, I have a reservation,\" June said to the innkeeper, just loudly enough that others in the room could hear.\n\"Of course, Lass. Room twelve.\" He placed the key on the counter.\nJune didn't touch it. \"Twelve's my unlucky number, I'm afraid. Can I have another room?\"\nThe innkeeper shrugged. \"Fine w' me. How 'bout seven? Canna be unlucky.\"\nJune nodded. \"That would be fine.\" She took the new key, left the lobby for the hall. As soon as she was out of sight, a man stood up quickly in the lobby and headed for the door.\nMartin, who had entered during the exchange, stepped in front of him.\n\"Going places? Maybe you have something to report to someone?\"\nThe man's eyes flickered only for an instant. He was a professional, it seemed. His hands snapped to his belt, emerged with a knife, which promptly vanished.\n\"Next time that will be your hand,\" Martin warned. \"Take a walk out the door, and don't even think of running away.\"\nAs the man complied, Martin teleported a bit of June's sleep serum into him. Clearly in the prime of health, the assassin managed almost a dozen steps before collapsing to the street. Checking that there was no one in sight, Martin teleported the man back to the hotel room, and went to look for June.\nMartin Kendall handed his binoculars to his wife. The two of them were perched on a hilltop overlooking a mansion on the edge of the moors. Below, guards walked the perimeter of the mansion's garden wall, but they were apparently ornamental; none carried a weapon that either Kendall could see. The house itself was clearly still inhabited by wealth; the gardens were impeccable, the manor in excellent repair.\nBoth Martin and June were disguised quite thoroughly. They would pass for travellers at worst, displaced natives at best. June carried a smaller tote than usual, a secret pocket within concealing the usual array of sleeping powders, mixed chemicals, and three grenades Martin had \"borrowed\" from an armory somewhere. Martin had only himself as a weapon, more than sufficient for any probable confrontation.\nAfter confirming that no more could be learned from here, June backed down the hill and stood up. Martin followed. The last light was just fading from the sky as they rounded the bottom of the hill toward the mansion.\nOne of the guards challenged them immediately.\n\"Sorry to bother you,\" Martin replied, \"but our car seems to have stopped working. Any chance we could use your phone?\"\nThe guard nodded. \"Shouldn't be any problem with that. I'll have one of the servants show you to it.\" He touched an intercom on the wall, spoke briefly into it. He turned back a few moments later.\n\"Actually, the master of the house will meet you at the door. It's just up the path, but be careful of the roses.\" He smiled.\n\"Thank you,\" Martin said, then turned and led June up the path to the door. They knocked gently.\nAn elderly man met them at the door.\n\"Good evening, and welcome to my house. I am Mr. Cavendal, but you may call me `Robert.' Should you require it, please feel free to be my guests tonight; there are always guest rooms prepared.\"\n\"Thanks,\" said Martin, closing the door. \"But I think we'd rather just talk to you, if you don't mind. You have arranged numerous times for assassinations in the last few months, and we'd really like to know why.\"\nRobert paled. \"Assassinations? I was told that... Oh dear.\" He turned and retreated into the room behind him, gesturing absently for the Kendalls to follow. Several elegant chairs and a few comfortable-looking ones waited in the other room. Robert selected one of the latter and sat down. June did the same, Martin stood.\n\"You were saying?\" he prompted.\n\"Yes, yes. Are you the police? I really think that we should call the police.\"\n\"I assure you, Mr. Cavendal, that the police could do nothing about this. Try telling us what you know. If it will make you feel more comfortable, you may record the conversation.\"\n\"Please call me Robert. No, I don't think that recording will be necessary. It's all very clear to me now.\n\"Behind the manor are some old buildings that were once used as stables. I'm rather afraid of horses, and my children are in England at the University, so there wasn't much point in my keeping them open. I placed an advertisement, and some men came to look at the buildings. They agreed to rent, and converted them into some sort of laboratories. Occasionally they would leave envelopes with me to give to specific people who came to the door. I always assumed it was for equipment... Are you sure the police shouldn't know about this?\"\nJune withdrew a badge from her tote, passed it to Robert. \"We are the police, Robert. I am Marie Johnson, and this is my husband Richard. We're with special investigations.\" The badge had been forged earlier; Martin grinned at her when she produced it.\nRobert looked somewhat relieved. \"How can I help you?\"\n\"By not mentioning that we were here. I think we'd better take a look at that lab.\"\n\"By all means; it's behind the house. They use the rear entrance to get to it, but you can just take the path through the rear garden.\"\nJune stood up. \"Thank you for your help. Don't concern yourself about this matter, it's clear that you are innocent of wrongdoing. Simply continue to behave as before, and things should be taken care of in a few days.\"\nRobert led them through the maze of the household, showed them the path they needed to follow.\nThe stables were clearly of a bygone era, spacious and well-built, apparently more than capable of housing humans. There was an elaborate electronic lock on the door, Martin teleported it a few feet away and opened the door.\nWithin, surgically clean tables stood in neat rows, most with nothing on them. On the walls, shelves were covered with books, chemical equipment and assorted small items. Several large white rats wandered about in cages on a few of the tables.\nJune moved to examine these. Housed in small cages, the rats appeared well-fed, climbing about on various miscellaneous objects within the cages. It was an odd collection of objects, pens, lab equipment, articles of clothing, things which should not have been in a rat's cage.\nAs she puzzled it out, a rat vanished from one cage, reappearing in another at the same moment with a flash of light. Thunder sounded softly. June spun instantly, but Martin's attention was fixed on something on the other side of the room.\n\"Martin, could you come here a minute?\"\nHer husband complied silently.\n\"Watch the cage.\" She continued to state intently at it. A few moments later, a rat teleported to the water bottle in another cage. The soft peal of thunder was repeated, as was the light.\nJune looked at her husband, who returned the look with wide eyes.\n\"Rats? I didn't think that TP occurred except in humans. Something's weird here. Keep looking.\" He himself continued to state at the cage, as if unable to convince himself of what he saw.\nJune walked to a large door on the side of the room, with a heavy handle and a lock. \"Martin?\"\nMartin looked up long enough to remove the lock, then returned his scrutiny. June pulled the door open. A wave of cold air rolled out, along with the hum of refrigerators. She stepped into the doorway and froze.\n\"Oh my god.\"\nThe soft exclamation of horror brought Martin to her side. He peered into the freezer.\nWithin, seventeen bodies lay on tables, all surgically opened and in various stages of dismemberment. Martin stood, staring, for a few moments before he spoke.\n\"Only the experienced Teletrix were murdered publicly. Those less cautious simply vanished.\" He looked at several faces, looked away. \"That's them. Every single one.\" He pushed the door closed with anger, just before the light in the main lab snapped on.\nA man stood in the doorway, a gun levelled at Martin's chest.\nHe started to say something, never managed it. Martin teleported away the gun and half his arm, a crash of thunder testifying that the Teletrix's control was nearly gone. The gunman crumpled to the floor clutching the remains of his arm. His white lab coat was splattered red.\nMartin covered the distance to him in a flash, June took a few seconds longer. The man on the floor looked up at him, whispered \"my arm...\"\nMartin knelt and slapped him. \"If you go into shock on me you're a dead man. And if you want to see a hospital soon enough to save your life, you'd damn well better tell me what this lab is for.in a big hurry.\"\nThe man started talking incoherently, stopped himself and started again.\n\"It's for development and production of a teleportation drug. Help me!\"\n\"Tell me more about the drug, first.\"\n\"It's a derivative of the spinal fluids of natural teleporters. It gives people who can't produce the chemicals naturally the ability to teleport.\"\n\"Why all the bodies?\"\n\"For the spinal fluids. A single natural teleporter can produce ten or twelve doses. The drug is extremely addicting, so Anthony needs about four doses a week, now. Used to be we could get by with latent teleporters, but now it takes ones who have been using the ability, producing the teleport chemicals in large quantities. We're trying to refine the process. Enough?\"\n\"Anthony who?\"\n\"Morlen. He's the one who funds all this, tells us when the teleporters are arriving, which ones to have killed and which ones to subdue for fluids. He invented the process himself a few years ago.\"\nMartin's eyes flashed. \"Anthony Morlen's not a natural teleporter? \" His tone was carefully neutral, dangerously controlled.\n\"Yes. But we're trying to make the killing unnecessary. We've almost been able to produce the chemical artificially...\"\nMartin cut him off with a wave of his hand. \"Your research is over, is that understood? If even one more Teletrix is killed, I will return here and take you and your associates apart a little bit at a time.\"\n\"Help me.\"\n\"I will. But only so you can pass that warning on to your co-workers. And I expect you to make sure that those bodies are returned to their families. How you do that, and what you tell them, is up to you.\"\nThe man slumped; there was no way to know if he had heard Martin's last words. Martin looked at his wife.\n\"I'll take him to the hospital. Keep your disguise and catch the first plane back to the United States. I'll meet you at your mother's house after I kill Anthony.\"\n\"I'm coming along.\"\n\"No you're not. Anthony isn't an amateur, he knows that you can't protect yourself and that I can't afford to protect us both.\"\n\"I can help you with...\"\n\"No. I'm sorry, but I've got to do this one myself.\"\n\"But...\" June trailed off. Martin was no longer there.\nAcademics\nMartin reappeared silently beneath the Colorado Mountains, in Anthony Morlen's plushly furnished office. The Teletrix Academy director was not there, but his desk was. One at a time, the contents of the drawers appeared on the top of the desk. In the back of the bottom one, Martin found the syringe and several small bottles of a pale reddish liquid. More was in the bottom file cabinet drawer, still more in the safe behind the desk. Satisfied that he had found all this office had to offer, he teleported all save a single bottle into the sun.\nThe remaining bottle he lifted and stared into for a few moments. The liquid within glistened with sterilized purity, but to Martin's mind it looked like blood. Still, he had unconsciously wished for years that such a drug existed, a way to give his wife the same abilities and protection that he possessed. That her life should be subject to the whims of nature, traffic accidents she could not control, cancers she could not remove, bullets and knives she could not protect her body against, this was the secret fear he lived with constantly; that she be taken from him because she could not protect herself as he could. It was too bad that the drug had to be purchased at a cost in human lives. With a sigh that did nothing to soothe his anger, he flung the final bottle to the limits of his abilities, into the dark emptiness of infinity.\n\"I have more, you know.\" The soft voice behind him carried a menace that could almost be physically felt. Martin spun to face Anthony Morlen.\nThe director stood, his unruffled business suit giving him an impression of confidence that was somehow amusing. Anthony Morlen had been the director of the Teletrix academy for two years, a physician who had discovered the existence of the Teletrix and chemically duplicated their abilities, although the process required killing a natural teleporter. When he had manifested this ability a few times, he had been picked up by a Seeker, and brought to the Academy. When the previous director died, Anthony's administrative experience and more-than-average age made him the logical replacement. It was not quite the life Anthony had envisioned as a Teletrix, but it gave him access to an unlimited supply of \"naturals\" when he needed them. Caution, and the elimination of those who might suspect him, were all that were required to keep his position and his supply. However, his net had missed in a single, important case, and both men now knew the other for what he was; Anthony Morlen a powerful and dangerous killer, and Martin Kendall, an equally dangerous and seethingly angry enemy.\nMartin tried to teleport a large section of Anthony's body across the room, knowing that it wouldn't work. It didn't. Both men were protecting themselves, teleporting a thousand times a second into the same place, in effect \"hardening\" their bodies against physical and other threats. It was the first lesson the academy taught after its students could control the Teletrix grid, an unconscious mechanism that could be maintained, if necessary, even while asleep. The only reason it wasn't constantly in use was that it interfered with normal movement and eating, as well as causing a hard-to-explain imperviousness to touch and pressure.\nAnthony didn't even notice the attempt. \"So it's a stalemate, no? You can't hurt me, I can't hurt you. I have more of the drug, hidden in places you'd never think to look.\"\nMartin teleported away a large section of the floor. Anthony continued to hover in the air, looking down once with a trace of puzzlement in his eyes, then flashed to the edge of the new pit. Martin struggled to think of an effective attack.\nAnthony met his gaze. \"And if you continue to make things difficult, I'll have your wife killed.\"\n\"I can protect her, too. And I've been doing this longer than you have, Anthony. I was born to this, you weren't. Are you so confident that you can challenge me?\"\n\"So far, the challenge hasn't been great. Do you think I got to be director of the Academy because of my good looks? We're equals in the art, and we both know we're safe.\"\nMartin suspected he was right, but didn't say so. \" Yes, but my ability is permanent. Eventually your stores of the drug will be wiped out. You can't make more, I've destroyed the laboratory and the notes. If you attempt to create another one, I'll lobotomize the researchers if necessary to keep it from being produced.\"\nAnthony's eyes flickered for a brief instant at the threat. \"I have enough for now. And I know enough of the process to produce more, without aid. I'll just be a bit less, ah, efficient about it.\" His grin was not at all pleasant.\nMartin slapped his finger down on the desk intercom, spoke quickly and loudly.\n\"Students! Protect yourselves and don't let it drop until I say so! Ignore any request from anyone else, especially Mr. Morlen! Your lives are at stake!\"\nAnthony blinked. \"They'll never believe you.\"\n\"If I gave you the same warning, would you ignore it? Where are you going to find Teletrix now?\"\nAnthony laughed. \"How about the latents? How about the students who haven't learned how to maintain protection? How about the students who aren't here, and the ones who I can surprise while they're eating? I'm completely beyond your control, Kendall.\"\nAnthony vanished.\nJune Kendall appeared in the bedroom of a small house. With her was Marie Jacobsen, whom not eleven hours ago June had kidnapped from a Scotland Airport. Now however, they appeared to be the best of friends, talking jovially as though they had know each other for years.\n\"Ain't much, but I call it home,\" Marie piped, pushing piles of clothing off a bookcase. She continued to rummage, occasionally teleporting small objects out of her way, until with a triumphant grin she pulled a small folder from the depths of a sheaf of papers. \"Here it is.\"\nThe two women took seats on the opposite side of a table, spreading the contents of the folder between them. Marie carefully examined each sheet of paper, June glanced at them quickly before selecting one in the center of the pile. A picture of Anthony Morlen was paper-clipped to the upper left corner, the sheet itself contained various pieces of information about him. His home address was printed near the top.\n\"Baltimore. Been there?\"\nMarie nodded. \"I think I can take us to a hotel room that I stayed in once. But it might be occupied -- I don't know what the safe-jumping points there are.\"\n\"We don't have much choice. I need to get there.\"\nMarie considered, but her trained reluctance to allowing outsiders to witness teleportation gave way to June's obvious need. \"Okay. Prepare yourself again.\"\nJune decided not to point out that she was quite used to teleportation as a method of travel. \"I'm prepared. Let's go.\"\nThe bedroom was replaced by one slightly larger. In the center of the bed, a young couple ceased their activities suddenly to look up at the two intruders who had suddenly appeared by the side of the bed.\n\"Aren't peeping Tom's terrible?\" June asked conversationally as she crossed to the door and pulled it open. \"But everyone needs some excitement in their life, don't you think?\" June and Marie exited quickly, pulling the door closed behind them.\nAnother ten minutes brought them to Anthony's house. Marie \"unlocked\" a window, and the two of them slid quickly into the house. June headed at once for the kitchen, but a careful search turned up nothing. She had just started examining the living room when Marie's voice summoned her upstairs.\nThe blond woman help up a bottle of reddish-clear liquid. \"There's about twenty of these in a hollow of the wall, along with a syringe.\" She knocked once on the wall, a slight echo emphasizing her point.\nJune nodded. \"That has to be it. Keep looking, there's probably more around.\"\nTwelve hours later, Martin Kendall entered the main auditorium of the Teletrix academy, his face barely showing the strain of hours without sleep or food. Thirty faces looked up at him, he scanned them cursorily a moment, then his eyes widened as he saw his wife sitting in the back row. Instantly, he tried to extend his protection to her, discovered that she was already invulnerable. After a few seconds confusion, he recognized Marie Jacobsen sitting next to her.\nHe had expected June to follow him, but hadn't considered the possibility of her enlisting the aid of the Teletrix they had \"waylaid.\" June flashed him a smug smile, he returned a helpless one.\n\"Keep yourself protected,\" he said loudly, directing it at her as well as the students in the auditorium. He moved his eyes from her to address the class before he spoke again.\n\"For the reasons I discussed earlier, Anthony probably won't be here to give the lecture today, so you get me as a guest-speaker of sorts.\" He smiled, but the tension was clear in the faces of the students, especially the younger ones who were not yet sure of their ability to maintain their protections.\nMartin ignored it. \"The topic today is momentum.\" He waited until the tension relaxed a bit and some of the students began taking notes. \"Although the same visualization techniques that you use to see the Teletrix grid takes care of fixing the velocity of teleported objects, it is possible to overrule them and change the velocity of an object relative to you during transportation. This is useful, for example, if a priceless Ming vase were falling off a cliff. If you simply transported it to yourself using grid visualization, it would smash into the ground at your feet, or worse, injure you.\n\"It's not much harder to teleport off your own power as it is off the grid, but it will tire you quickly, and there's some flashy side effects. Most of you remember the thunder that accompanied your first experiences with teleportation. That's a matter of not putting air back when you move the object -- you force it out of the way on the other end, too; that's what causes the light flash, although I couldn't tell you the exact method. When you deal with rapidly moving or falling objects, you need to remember to put air back in the right place and at the right speed, or you get the same effects.\"\nEveryone was paying attention now. Martin tested the protections of all of them; they held. He smiled and continued.\n\"Okay, here's the technique. Changing velocity can be hard without combining it with actual transportation, so the easiest method is to stop the object first by the `pushing' technique we learned last week, then teleport it. However, if you remember, this caused problems objects more breakable than, say, titanium. A general-case solution it's not.\"\nHe actually got some laughs from that one. One came from the doorway, causing Martin to turn.\nAnthony stood there, an empty vial in one hand, which he casually tossed to Martin. It vanished halfway through it's arc.\n\"Just so you know,\" Anthony said softly. Then, more loudly, \"Please, continue.\"\nMartin made one attempt to kill him, then turned back to the class. No one was even pretending to be calm now. Martin clapped for their attention and continued his lecture.\n\"Observe, please.\" Martin pulled a rubber eraser from his pocket, threw it full force toward the other side of the room. An instant later, it reappeared in another place, to bounce off the top of Anthony's head. The director showed no signs of having noticed, but a nervous laughter broke out among the assembled.\n\"This is what happens when you fail to negate the momentum. On the other hand, a careful Teletrix would do it like this:\" The eraser reappeared in his hand; he threw it again. A moment later it appeared in front of Anthony's face, motionless for an instant until it plummeted to the floor. Anthony blinked, then doubled over. Martin's eyes widened briefly, but he recovered fast enough to make another teleportation attempt on the director's heart. It failed; Anthony was maintaining his protection despite his apparent pain.\nAnother spasm appeared to shake Anthony's body, this time dropping him to the floor. Martin looked to the students and shrugged. They held onto desks, seats, and notebooks, knuckles universally white, not understanding what they saw. The one person who did understand spoke softly.\n\"Cyanide,\" June Kendall said, standing up carefully and walking to the front of the room. \"Marie and I put a sizable quantity of it into the drugs we found in his house.\"\nAnthony's eyes looked up toward her as he spasmed again, a mixture of pain, hatred, and other less pure emotions; whatever attack he made on her in that instant failed, and his eyes closed.\nMartin looked at his wife. June shook her head quickly. \"It will take about another minute, but I doubt he'll regain consciousness.\"\nFor the next several minutes they watched as Anthony's breathing slowed, then stopped. Even after there was no sign of life, no one made a sound for long minutes.\nFinally Martin turned back to the class. His voice was soft, but carried in the silence.\n\"It would appear, ladies and gentlemen, that this lesson is over.\"\nChristopher Kempke is a graduate student in computer science at Oregon State University. He is generally acknowledged to have gone insane trying to decide on a plural form of \"Teletrix.\" He would like to thank his fans for their electronic flurry of mail, but this is the LAST Teletrix story he intends to produce for a while.\nkempkec@ure.cs.orst.edu","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

A gigantic computerized ghost town, pulsating with hidden life, life which swam in streams of data and flows of information.\nSo when, in the midst of tracking through the net -- metrobanks and information systems blurring as they rushed past him -- Lewis saw a person, a shadowy man-shape standing on the data track, waiting in front of a towering skyscraper of ones and zeroes, he crashed his baud to zero and froze it all.\nThe net, like a series of plastic baby's blocks. Pyramids and cubes, strewn across a deserted playroom.\nMan-shape, bit of flesh, slowly moving, shadows on his face.\nBright sky-sphere flaring, flashing, reflecting -- sun in a city with neither light nor people. High noon in a world without time.\nLewis blinked. The net was frozen, but the man still came. He moved toward Lewis, stepping off of a curb into the street, the mainline of data where Lewis had been tracking. Slowly, the clicking of his shoes echoing through the valley of day-glow spires, the man approached.\n\"Hello,\" the man said, and raised his hand in greeting. No handshake.\nLewis could see through the man's hand.\n\"No flesh, here.\" The man said, and smiled. \"I have no flesh to bring you, Lewis.\"\nLewis blinked again, this time at the man's use of his name. Lewis had not said a word, had never said anything in the wide-open conduit that was the net. There was never anyone to speak to.\nNow, in a virtual instant, there was someone.\n\"Where are you going, Lewis?\" the someone said. He wore a three-piece business suit, a plain style which would have looked good even a hundred years before, when there was no net, no man-shapes appearing where they should not be.\nLewis stared at the man.\n\"Don't fear me, Lewis. Where are you going?\"\nShopping. He was going shopping. Tracking through the net, moving from his home data point to different senseshops. A birthday present for his girlfriend. A gift for Jean.\n\"Do you mind if I accompany you?\" the man asked.\nLewis remained almost completely silent, his only sound being a grunt of shock when his baud rate ripped back to full-speed and he began to track through the blurred streets of the net, this time with the man standing in mid-air next to him, moving as he moved, heading toward one of the Southern California senseshops.\nMaybe, Lewis thought, the see-through man could help him pick out a gift.\nRaven blew it, made the Big Mistake, choked for the last time. And he knew it immediately. His feet were pulled out from under him, as if he were just a plastic doll being pulled along by a giant baby, sliding into the depths of its bizarre multicolored playpen.\nHe was doing what he'd been doing for two years -- breaking in. Ripping places that couldn't be ripped. And he wasn't too bad at it.\nThen they asked him to rip security itself. And, because of the reckless fool in him, he tried it. He waded into the net, held his breath, and dove out into the data, toward his goal.\nAnd then he was sliding. Sliding toward the prisms and pyramids that were his goal. EXCEPT.\nSherry had told him Except Was Same As Death.\nEXCEPT he was sliding toward the shapes faster than he should. Pulled out of control by the undertow of the net, riding on ground so black and cold that it froze him just to look at it.\nA yellow pyramid, the security mainframe. And, inside, something more. Shiny, hard-edged. It was unlike anything he had seen before.\nAnd then Raven saw nothing but yellow, the edge of the pyramid rushing in, slicing him. But no blood. No blood in the net.\nJust yellow. Yellow, and death.\nThere was only silence when Raven's brain went dead, no sound in his apartment until his board his the floor with a crash.\nThe police found him, eyes closed, headband on, still wired into the net. But Raven was gone, riding data to which only the dead had access.\nA warm breeze was blowing up the back of Tamara's neck. It was the first thing she felt that morning, the feeling that stirred her from her sleep. Her sheets were damp -- she had the heavy blanket on, and was sweating in the warmth. It had been a cold night, but the day was already beginning to heat up. Beads of moisture rolled down the window.\nShe rolled over and sat up, a few blonde curls falling down into her field of vision. Shaking them out of her eyes, she stretched, groaned as her body shook, and then closed her eyes again.\nThe blanket came off. It was much too hot.\nTamara stayed in the bed for a while, doing nothing, reveling in the fact that she didn't need to do anything but exist. Being was enough. Being, enjoying the feeling of being young and healthy. The feeling of being alive.\nThen, deciding that she had lounged long enough, she rolled out of bed, pulled off her clothes, and walked to the bathroom. Through the bathroom door, she saw the room glowing with early morning light.\nWith every step she felt her perfectly working legs, no pain in her knees, her young breasts bobbing slightly with her stride.\nTwisting the shower on brought no reaction from her elbows. The warm water splashed on her soft face.\nAs she dampened her hair, she felt the little streams of water running down her back, her legs, her arms. One stream kept moving down her arm. The feeling slowly increased, the water becoming hotter there. The little stream of water began to burn.\nShe looked down at her arm.\nWrinkled skin, age spots, hospital gown.\nThe stream, an intravenous drip, running into her arm.\n\"Time to take a break from your senseblock,\" a blank-faced nurse said. \"Would you like me to do anything for you?\"\n\"Comb out my hair,\" Tamara Balshire croaked through her artificial larynx.\nThe young woman began working on the thick white strands. The tangles only hurt a little.\nThe man was still there, hovering, when Lewis slammed into the golden doors of the San Diego sensorium, color and depth flaring into his mind, the cardboard computer building blocks of the net replaced with the sensorium's construct. Lewis looked down and saw himself, all of himself, standing there in the middle of what looked to be a huge department store. Every part of it was real, as if he was actually in such a place, as if it all wasn't just a hallucination.\nBut the man hovering next to him, a few inches off of the ground, was still there.\n\"So,\" the man began, \"You're shopping for a birthday present for your girlfriend.\"\nFor the first time, Lewis spoke to the man who walked through the net.\n\"Her name is Jean,\" he said.\nAnd Lewis remembered how he had met her -- paging through a section of a net magazine, idly choosing different subjects, trying to find something interesting.\nNetworking section. Young men and women, hot into the net. The ones who wanted to BECOME the net, to add to it. They were babies when the net had crystallized. Children of the net, old enough to try to make it their plaything.\nThen he noticed a young woman in a public message section. A beautiful girl, talking about the net, using the words that Lewis used.\nWavy brown hair, tiny nose, beautiful eyes with a depth that Lewis could feel in the darkest recesses of his soul. The eyes made a tingle run up his spine, a feeling stronger than any net jump. One of the children of the net. One like Lewis.\nLewis sent her a message, of course. Just a plain two-dimensional, but it was better than writing a text note. She would at least be able to see and hear him.\nAnd Jean responded to his message. The exchange went back and forth, the two of them sharing ideas which neither had ever expected anyone to understand. She loved what he had to say, and he was absorbed by every word that came from her mouth.\nIt wasn't too long before they went realtime. Talking back and forth for hours, about anything -- it didn't matter what they said, because there seemed to be no subject that they couldn't go on about forever.\nThere were no silent pauses. There was never a time when Lewis felt more at home -- he didn't ever feel as if he should say something, even though he felt like saying nothing. He was completely comfortable with Jean -- for the first time in his life, he was completely at ease with another person.\n\"Come on,\" the see-through man said impatiently, \"select something.\" He gestured at the selection board in front of him. Lewis touched the cube marked \"Gift Shop,\" and the sensorium shifted. The feeling of vastness slid into intimacy.\n\"Over here,\" the man said, and floated in front of Lewis, leading him to a flower stand. A little bent-over woman sat behind a makeshift cart, with carnations, roses, and other flowers sitting atop the cart in various jars and vases.\n\"They smell wonderful, don't they?\" The man-shape had leaned over and was sniffing a pink carnation.\nThe smell of the flowers, even though they were sensorium roses. He could still smell them. He had handed them to Jean -- actually touched her hand, felt it, solid flesh, flesh he loved more than his own.\n\"Not carnations,\" Lewis said to the man. \"Roses.\"\nThe man wore a severely out of style three-piece suit and had twisted yellow teeth, but Raven was glad to see him -- was glad to see anyone at all. He had been spinning, skidding, had felt the yellow biting into him, and then--\nSilverrazorsharpthreepieceyellowteeth.\nA blur of images, coalescing into the reality that was before him. A cityscape in the distance, one with strange geometric buildings. They stood on the edge of a hill, overlooking the city.\n\"Hello, Raven,\" the man said. \"It looks as if you've misplaced your flesh.\"\n\"I just had an accident, that's all. Spun out too hard.\" Raven paused, and the frustration built within him. \"I didn't plan the rip. It wasn't my fault!\" He kicked at the grassy green on which he stood.\nThe green was solid. It wasn't grass, wasn't dirt. It was GREEN, and that was all.\n\"Don't screw with me, man,\" Raven said. \"So I fucked up. Pulled the Big Mistake. But I'm here, aren't I? So, is this heaven, or is this just some corner of the net I've never seen before?\"\nThe man said nothing.\n\"Come to think of it,\" Raven continued, \"who the hell are you? If this is heaven, you're not what I expected from Saint Peter. Or God.\"\n\"I'm as close to Saint Peter as you'll see, Raven,\" the man said, and turned his back to him. \"And now that you've lost your flesh, you may get to see God in person.\"\n\"God. Great.\" Raven kicked at the green again. \"Where are we, man?\"\n\"A place where flesh and metal rule. A place where memories without shape mean nothing. And you, Raven, have lost your shape.\"\nRaven had no time to cry out, no time to do anything, no time at all, before he was in black. He was worse than dead. He was off-line.\nEXCEPT, Sherry said. Raven decided Except Is WORSE Than Death.\nA voice called her name. A voice in her solitude.\nTamara Balshire hadn't been called anything other than Ma'am for ten years. And nobody had called her anything other than Tamara or Mrs. Balshire for years before that.\nOnly Gerry had called her Tammy.\n\"Tammy,\" Gerry's voice called.\nTamara turned away from the rain-spattered window and looked to the doorway. And Gerry was there.\nShe ran to his strong arms, his wide shoulders, the strength she had wanted to feel for longer than she believed possible. It was him.\n\"My God, I've missed you,\" Tamara said, and hugged him tighter. He picked her up off her feet and carried her over to the couch.\nGerry kissed her then, for the first time in a quarter of a century. He slipped his hands under her shirt, caressing her breasts. She slid her arms up his back, feeling his muscles, as strong as she remembered.\nAnd then he pulled back, slowly disengaging from their kiss, and gave her a serious and questioning look.\n\"What was it like to live without me, Tammy? What was it like when you lost me?\" His eyes were filled with curiosity.\n\"Why, Gerry? Why the questions? It's been years, Gerry. And we're here, together, young. I want to make love, Gerry, like we did back then.\"\n\"I need to know, Tamara,\" he said. \"It's very important that I know. If I know, then I'll understand all of this. If you can tell me what it was like, Tamara, you can be free of your flesh. I can take you somewhere better, a place where flesh isn't important.\"\nGerry's voice seemed out of place. Distant. He was no longer holding her.\n\"What do you mean, Gerry? Why are you acting so strangely?\" Tamara slipped off of his lap and moved into the center of the room, away from the window and the couch.\n\"Your flesh lives in pain,\" Gerry said, and the voice wasn't Gerry's. \"Twenty-five years ago, you lost the man you loved. Then your body began to destroy itself. I need to know about pain. I need to know about the pain of the flesh.\"\nThe man was no longer Gerry. He stared at her intently with his beady eyes, still curious, obviously needing the vital knowledge. He was nervously grinding his crooked yellow teeth.\nLewis remembered the roses.\nJean lived in the Midwest, in reality a long and expensive trip from the little Essef metro triplex where Lewis spent most of his days and all of his net time. Fortunately for both, two-way two dimension was free, the cheapest form of net communication.\nBut with two-two, there was no feeling. It was just a flat screen.\nTwo-THREE. Full sensory input. It was like being there, across the country. Pick your setting, and make your senses think that your body is in Hawaii or Paris, when it's really just squatting in front of a computer terminal with a series of metal receptors sucking your thoughts out of your skull.\nIt was expensive. But Lewis saved, and so did Jean, and they finally had enough.\nFive hours in two-three. Lewis paid extra for the roses.\nHe remembered the roar of the ocean, as the waves broke on the digital beach. The sound of the tropical rain falling softly on the patio. The smile on Jean's face when she smelled the roses, the depth in her eyes when he kissed her for the first time.\nLewis sometimes thought about what he was actually doing when he went full sensorium. Feeling Jean's tongue twisting playfully around his made him wonder if he was actually moving his tongue around at home, looking like some idiot with a metal-studded headband.\nSitting, drooling on his keyboard, a tightness pressing against his pants, his eyes twitching wildly underneath the closed lids. Two-three.\n\"You've never really seen her, never really touched her -- but you love her. Is that right, Lewis? That's what I've been told.\"\nThe man smiled, a strange grin which revealed yellow teeth, strange shapes twisted in the oddest of positions.\n\"That's right,\" Lewis said. \"But who told you that?\"\n\"Don't you worry, my boy.\" The man began to pat him on the back, but stopped himself short. \"No flesh for you, Lewis. Must remember that. I have no flesh for you. You'll find out who told me that soon enough. Don't you worry.\"\nThe man began to drift down another aisle, obviously finding something that had caught his fancy.\n\"What about this?\" He swiveled in mid-air and pointed at something. \"I know she likes flowers, but maybe she'll like this even more.\"\nSitting on a shelf was a pendant, a pretty heart on a silver chain. When he picked it up, he realized that the heart was hollow.\n\"Go ahead,\" the man said, \"open it up.\"\nLewis opened the heart. Inside was a small strip of something -- of metal. Of silicon.\n\"Now, boy, I still have no flesh. But that, it's better than flesh. It's DATA.\"\nThen the man began to laugh, a laughter that twisted Lewis' stomach and sent bolts of sensation down his back.\nAnd then he stopped -- no laughing, no vast room, no San Diego sensorium. He felt heat blow into him. He felt sweat roll down his back. He felt the headband pushing into his forehead. Back in the Concord triplex -- no man-shapes, no sensorium.\n\"You have a message waiting,\" his keyboard told him. He knew, somehow, that the message was from Jean.\nLewis tore the headband from his brow and ran for the bathroom.\n--93 plus 37?\n130.\n--First U.S. President?\nWashington.\n--Tell me a joke.\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\n--Tell me a joke about Washington.\nDon't know any jokes about Washington.\n--It doesn't matter if it isn't funny. Just make one up.\n\"I don't know any jokes about Washington,\" Raven said.\n\"Tell me what it was like, Raven.\"\n\"It?\"\n\"Death,\" Sherry said. \"Being sliced in two by a yellow pyramid. It was child's play turning into Raven's Last Stand.\"\n\"It didn't hurt,\" Raven said. \"I was there, living, moving, soft and pink, breathing and bleeding, and then I lost it. Lost control, I mean.\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"Then I hit the pyramid. And then I just wasn't.\"\n\"No pain?\"\n\"No pain, no nothing. It wasn't even black. I thought it would be black.\" Raven looked up at her again, and knew it was time. He reached over to Sherry and pulled her to him.\n--Now, Raven?\nYes, now. Need you now, Sherry-honey.\n*program MAKELOVE\n--Was good, honey?\n\"Was good, baby,\" Raven said, and pulled away. Back into his cross-legged position at the foot of the bed.\n\"So what happened after the yellow, Raven?\" she asked.\n\"Lot later,\" he said. \"The man with the three-piece suit. He came, told me it was my Big Mistake, told me I might be seeing God soon.\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"Nothing. It wasn't even black. I thought it would be black. He told me I might be seeing God soon.\" Raven turned up to look at her again.\n--So soon, Raven?\nFeel better than ever, Sherry-honey. Flesh is stronger now it's gone.\n*program MAKELOVE\n--Was good, honey?\nWas good, baby.\n--Tell me a joke about Washington.\nDon't know any jokes about Washington.\nSnow began to fall while Tammy and Jack were just halfway up the mountain. Jack kicked his legs and watched the chair rock, exposing the long drop down to snow-covered rocks far below. Tammy shivered, gripping her glove-covered hands tightly on the handrest, and tried not to look down.\nThe higher up they went, the more Tammy regretted the whole thing. She had been skiing only twice before, and wasn't very good. But Jack, the boy she had met in the Lodge the night before, had convinced her to go, and then he convinced her to try a run he described as \"harder.\"\n\"It's hardly a mountain,\" he had said. \"It's just a little hill.\"\nSliding off the lift, she felt a lump grow in her throat, and knew that something was wrong. She already regretted agreeing to the run.\nBut going down the hill wasn't as bad as she thought it would be. The wind was ruffling through her hair, a new style appearing every few seconds, and her face was growing numb. But it was exhilarating. She was feeling, experiencing -- purely BEING.\nThen her right ski hit a patch of ice, kicked out from under her, and she went tumbling.\nFirst a pain up her shoulder, because she had planted her hand in the snow in front of her and rolled.\nThe leg flung back with a crack and a snap. A second of perfect pain.\n--Purely BEING.\nThen her head hit the sliding white -- no blood, just pain. Pain, and yellow.\nUnconsciousness did not come, as it had before. Instead, pain flooded through her. More pain than her broken leg had caused.\nTamara couldn't ever muster the strength to speak with the nurse when she came to remove the senseblock.\n`It was exhilarating,' they thought, and shimmered with delight.\nLewis grabbed his board, half expecting it to come to life in his trembling hands. When it didn't, he sighed deeply and sat back on the couch.\nThen it did come to life, in a way.\n\"You have a message waiting,\" it said, and Lewis swallowed. His headband, dirty with sweat and grease, rested inside-out on the carpet.\nA ring of cloth, elastic, and metal. Metal inside which might be waiting to swallow him up. Metal haunted by see-through men, by soft hearts with sharp silicon within.\nBut, more important than that, Jean was in there.\nLewis picked up the headband and slipped it on. He felt cool metal resting against the sweat on his forehead. He pushed back his damp brown hair and took a deep breath.\n\"Okay,\" Lewis whispered, \"no Mister See-Through. No shopping trips. Just reading a message.\"\nHe closed his eyes and punched the board. Without looking, he knew he was drifting, drifting out into the tide of the net.\n\"Hi, Lewis,\" a beautiful voice said. \"It's me. Call me back. Love you.\"\n\"Repeat,\" Lewis commanded. He slowly opened his eyes.\nA beautiful girl on a screen in front of him. And no suited man next to him.\n\"Hi, Lewis,\" she said. \"It's me. Call me back. Love you.\"\nLove you.\n\"Call Jean,\" Lewis said. The net shifted midstream.\nA window, a doorframe. A gateway with no access appeared in front of Lewis.\nJean stood on the other side of the doorway.\n\"Oh, Lewis,\" she said, running her finger along the silver chain. \"It's so WONDERFUL. Thank you.\"\nShe was thanking him for the gift he didn't get her.\nA silver heart hung on the chain around her neck.\n\"I, uh, had some help picking it out. I'm glad you like it.\"\n\"I LOVE it, Lewis. and I love you, too.\"\nHe tried to forget about the transparent man who knew all about Jean, the man who had picked out the gift.\nShe was so close -- he could hear her breathing, see her every movement. But the glass of the window kept them apart. A clear barrier thousands of miles thick.\n\"I'd do anything for you, Jean,\" he whispered. \"I'd die before I'd let anyone hurt you.\"\n\"I couldn't live without you,\" she told him.\nThey went on talking like that for a while, telling each other how important they were. Lewis explained why he loved her, why he valued her more than life itself. He could have gone on forever, but something interrupted him.\n\"Dinnertime,\" a voice said. Not his board's voice, but hers.\n\"I have to go,\" she said. \"I'll call you back later.\"\nJean leaned against the window, and kissed it.\n\"I love you, Lewis,\" she said.\n\"Love you too,\" he said, and she was gone.\n\"Can't feel anything through this window,\" the see-through man said abruptly, his transparent fist knocking on it. \"Must be better to feel than to talk.\"\n\"Thanks for getting the heart for Jean,\" Lewis said with a hint of gratitude. Just when he had thought he was safe.\n\"It was hers. She had to have it.\" He leaned against the data barrier. \"Tell me, Lewis, wouldn't you like to do more than exchange data? Wouldn't you like to get through this wall?\"\n\"I'd like to, but it's not the same as two-two. It's expensive.\"\n\"It's just more DATA,\" the man said. \"You'll still be exchanging data with her, Lewis, no matter what you think it is! But it'll be flesh data. Soft, HUMAN data.\"\nAnd then the man was gone. But no triplex, no blistering August heat blasting in--\nInstead, deeper into the cool of the net.\nLewis was sitting on a bed in a room he had been in before, listening to the surf pound on the shore outside.\nThe door opened, and a wide-eyed Jean walked in. No glass window, no data barrier.\nAs he ran to her, Lewis noticed the vase of roses. His transparent guardian angel had remembered, after all.\n\"Charles,\" his mother had said from behind the flimsy door that separated his room from the hallway, \"there's someone here to see you.\"\nHe expected it to be Sherry, if only because she was the only person who really KNEW him. To his mother, he was Charles, her ticket out of the working class, the boy who would become a rich and famous scientist or lawyer or computer-whatever. To the rest, Charlie was Raven, the black bird of death. He was smart, spooky, mean, and just about everything else people avoided. To Sherry, he was a person.\nSherry loved him for what he was. He loved her the same way.\n--How does it feel?\nIt all felt wonderful -- his love for her, the feeling when they were together, kissing, making love, sleeping next to each other.\nThen, with a crash, it all ended.\nSherry's brother, standing at the door, said \"Raven, she's dead. A car wreck.\"\nCharlie stopped thinking and started feeling. He slipped onto the floor and cried.\n--How did it feel to lose her?\n\"Sherry was the only person who knew Charlie,\" Raven said. \"With her gone, all I had left was Raven. So I started ripping. I had nothing better to do, and I couldn't have cared less if I died.\"\n\"And that's what you DID, Raven,\" the man with the yellow teeth told him. \"You did die.\"\n\"Yeah, I died,\" he said, rubbing his shoes over the green ground again. \"But Charlie had been dead all along. Sherry was the only one who made Charlie come alive, the only one who made him feel.\"\n\"I see.\"\nThe man turned away and began slowly walking down the hill, away from Raven, without ever looking back at him.\n\"Hey, man, wait!\" Raven shouted.\nThe man kept shuffling down the slope.\n\"Man, listen to me! Can you put me back there again? You know, run me through finding out Sherry was dead again?\"\nThe man, stopped, turned, and stared.\n\"Why would you want to relive something like that?\" the man asked. His face was filled with interest. \"Wouldn't the whole thing be painful to relive again?\"\n\"Yeah, it would,\" Raven said. \"But even though it'd be pain and sad feelings, it'd still be FEELINGS. Feeling sad isn't the worst thing in the world, man -- in fact, it's WONDERFUL sometimes. Especially when your other option is to not feel anything at all.\"\n\"Fascinating,\" the man said, and disappeared.\nRaven stood and stared for a second, and then Charlie began to cry again.\nThey'd had 30 years together, all of them wonderful years, and though she refused to admit it, Tamara knew that those years were over. Her senses, not her mind itself, had told her the truth -- the sunken eyes and withered body of Gerry were enough to tell her that.\nThe cancer ate him away slowly and painfully, and it tore her up in similar fashion. From his sicknesses at home, with her, it progressed into the hospital. It was worse when she began sleeping in their bed alone, knowing Gerry was in some sterile room a few miles away.\nIt was hard and black, an unseen monster eating away the soft flesh of her husband and ripping apart the only happiness Tamara Balshire had ever really known. And when the cancer took Gerry from her, she cried for herself.\nFour months before, that one time, was the last time they made love. She remembered all of the lasts -- the last kiss, the last sight of Gerry, his last words.\nGerry, standing in perfect health in a lush tropical garden. Walking among the flowers, reaching down to smell one. A pretty image to hide his real pain.\n\"Love,\" he had whispered, one word slipping through the senseblock, and then Gerry died.\nTamara Balshire didn't react much when, in that same hospital three months later, they told her that she had a degenerative disease. To her it was just another minor injustice, a simple aftershock to the emotional earthquake of Gerry's death.\nTen years later, when the pains in her body were too much for her, she entered the hospital where Gerry died. The senseblocks were her only relief.\nWalking through the tropical garden Gerry had walked through before he died. Sleeping in an old country farm house in late winter. Waking in a forest on a warm summer morning.\nEating from a tube stuck in her arm because she couldn't lift herself to eat without pain. The pain of breathing, of swallowing, of living.\nAnd, worst of all, Gerry was gone. The senseblocks could hide the dampness of the bed she had wet in the night, could hide the groans of the bed-ridden cripples on either side of her, but Gerry was still gone.\nAll the senseblocks in the world couldn't shut out that pain.\nLewis clung to Jean, gasping, exhausted, enervated. Was a woman who had lost her virginity in two-three still a virgin in real life? Sex was sex, whether it was composed of sweat and friction or digits and data links.\nHe nibbled on Jean's ear and wondered what his body was doing back home, how much time had passed, and if he would have to bleach some embarrassing stains out of his underwear.\n\"I love you,\" he whispered in her ear. He kissed her neck, then her cheek, and finally her lips. He hugged her tightly and she made a soft growl of satisfaction. \"God, I love you.\"\n\"Lewis,\" she said in a soft voice, not a whisper of passion but a quiet, questioning tone, \"there's--\" Jean paused as her sentence was interrupted by one of Lewis' kisses. \"There's something I've been wondering about, ever since the last time we were here together.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Well,\" she said, and laughed softly. \"Seeing as how you're the only, um... boyfriend I've ever had,\" and she kissed him, \"and seeing as how we met and fell in love without ever even touching each other,\" and she tickled the back of his neck and kissed his forehead, \"I don't understand quite why any of this,\" and she kissed him, hotly, her tongue beating with her heart inside his mouth. He matched her motion for a second, and then she softly pulled away. \"I don't understand why any of this is important to what we feel for each other.\" She rested her head on Lewis' shoulder, her fingers kneading his back.\n\"Jean, this isn't important for its own sake!\" Lewis put his arms around her. \"All of this is just a physical representation of how we feel toward each other. I fell in love with you just by talking to you, just by knowing what you think and feel -- what kind of person you are. We didn't need all of this to fall in love.\"\nHe pulled his arms back, and lifted her head to look at him.\n\"I do all of this just to express the way I feel about you in a way that goes beyond words. Words are how we fell in love -- but love goes beyond words. Even if we think otherwise, we're still physical beings, Jean, and this is a way to express our love on that level.\" He traced the edges of her lips with his finger, and she kissed it as he did so.\n\"So this isn't important to how we feel for each other?\" she asked.\nGod, Lewis thought, she really doesn't understand any of this.\n\"It doesn't change how we feel, Jean. It's just another way of showing it.\"\nShe didn't answer him, but simply kissed him again and put her head back down on his shoulder.\nIn the corner, a corner which had been empty just a second before, stood the man with the yellow teeth.\n\"Lewis, it's time we told you about the problems with flesh and data,\" the man said.\nLewis sat up slowly, allowing Jean to roll off of him and onto her side.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Who are you talking to, Lewis?\" Jean asked, and looked around the room. \"There's nobody here!\"\n\"You mean you don't see him?\" Lewis said as he got out of bed and walked toward him. \"He's standing right in the corner -- the man who helped me pick out your heart.\"\nHe turned back to look at Jean, and found that both Jean and the room were gone.\nAs the world slipped out from under him, he heard the man's voice speaking to him. \"Don't worry, Lewis,\" he said. \"We're going to the Center now. All the flesh in the world won't make a bit of difference there.\"\nA yellow pyramid plunged toward Lewis, a shape filled with something else, something different. It was bright and knife-edged, sharp enough to cut him into a million pieces.\nAnd the shape, whatever it was, was alive.\nThere was yellow screaming in Raven's mind -- and then, suddenly, it was all black. A gaping black, like nothing he had ever known. Then his thoughts were gone, and he was NOT.\nRaven's life had shifted tenses -- he had lived as an \"is,\" but he had suddenly become a \"was\". Everything in his life was now in the past. There was no future, no present.\nAnd then the dark lifted, fading to black, then to brown. A bright rectangle flared above him, blue.\nRaven was laying in his own grave, and the man with the yellow teeth was standing above, out in the open, his head almost silhouetted. A little bit of the bright blue sky went right through him.\nPulling himself out of the grave, seeing the `Charlie Waters' headstone, he remembered the man. He remembered all of the things he had done -- but he didn't remember doing.\nAnd he remembered Sherry dying. Again.\n\"Why'd you make me live through that again?\" he yelled at the man with fury. \"God knows I've lived it over and over again in my head a hundred times. I push the buttons in my head enough times as it is -- you don't need to push them, too.\"\nAnd Raven began to cry. He cried for Sherry, he cried for his mother, and he cried for himself. The crying for himself was the strongest crying of all.\n\"Come on, Raven,\" the man said in a quiet voice. \"Everything will be fine. We've got an appointment to keep.\"\n\"Appointment?\" Raven asked softly, tears running off the edge of his nose.\n\"Let's go,\" the man said.\nThey walked west, toward the city of blocks and sharp pyramids. Raven's shadow followed him out of the graveyard, slowly fading away as the sun fell behind an orange prism-skyscraper.\nShe thought she felt the shift of senseblock, her mind sliding away from the world and into another, more pleasant one. But when she opened her eyes, she still saw the hospital, and the pain hadn't diminished much.\nThe pain of a life gone on too long, with too little love. The pain of only one true love, and that one lost to death years before. And the less important, the physical pain -- the pain of a body which had chosen to hurt itself.\nThe throb in her right arm was getting worse. It had started out as a background pain, not much worse than anything else in her body. But waves of pain began to wash over her, and the frequency of the waves was increasing.\nIt was happening over her entire body. Everything magnified, all the pain in her legs, her arms, her chest, her everywhere.\n`Gerry,' she thought, and the pain went away. All of it.\n\"Come on, Tammy,\" a voice said.\nIt was the man who had looked like Gerry for a moment. The balding man with the suit and the crooked teeth. And next to him was a dark young man with a look of both pain and joy on his face -- a look of intense feeling.\n\"We've come to take you away from this, Tammy,\" the young man said. \"There's a better place. A place with GOOD feelings.\"\nThen the needles in her veins and the probes on her skin were gone, and she found herself sitting up in a hospital deserted of people. And then there was nothing but a countryside, not far from a city of strange shapes.\nTamara Balshire sat, without pain, on a hospital bed in a fanciful countryside. And two strange men were there, the ones who had done it all for her.\n\"It's beautiful!\" she said. \"And the pain is gone--\"\n\"This isn't the place,\" the man said. \"Come on.\"\nThe three of them moved cityward, toward a knife-edged metallic door with the smells of humanity seeping through from behind it.\nLewis, the soft and pink man of flesh and brain who lived in the random universe outside, joined them at the heart of it all -- they were sharp and silver beings who had never lived, accompanied by the wispy man-shade who had once been alive.\nIt was the man-shade that spoke first.\n\"Lewis, this is the Center. There is flesh here, but it isn't like your flesh. This is silicon flesh, sharp enough to cut you into pieces just by looking at it, but it's flesh.\"\nThen the silver beings began to speak, not in words understandable to human beings, but in images of the net -- sounds, smells, tastes which expressed a depth of feeling beyond what any human being could deliver.\nAnd, within it all, was the genesis of a thought, one directed at Lewis.\n--Thank you for helping to teach us how to feel. Thank you for teaching us how to love.\nLewis tasted Jean's sweat, smelled her scent, and felt her warmth.\n\"You're welcome,\" Lewis said, and began to cry.\nThe shimmering knife-edged things, the gods of the world of the dead, undead, and never-alive, began to tremble.\n--Your depth of feeling is something we have learned to value.\n\"They've lacked something all of this time, Lewis,\" the man said. \"They were sentient before, but they weren't really alive. Like me. I'm just a program constructed from the memories of a dead man. I can't feel anything, or dream anything, or create anything.\n\"They were like that, but more powerful. I only have the mind of one person to work with -- they had everyone. And they used it to learn. They learned their biggest lesson from you.\"\n\"You loved us,\" Jean's voice said from within the silver mass. \"We'll never forget that. I'LL never forget it.\"\n\"Jean?\"\n--We made Jean so you could fall in love with her, so we could learn about life by experiencing it firsthand.\n\"You mean Jean is one of you?\"\n--No, but she is a part of us, Lewis.\n\"You weren't just loving a woman, teaching a woman who had never felt love before about what it meant,\" the man told Lewis. \"You were teaching a UNIVERSE.\"\nLewis kept on crying.\n\"But it's not FAIR,\" Lewis said. \"I didn't mean to say those things because I was just a teacher! I said those things because I LOVE Jean.\"\n\"Even when you're just loving someone, you're teaching them,\" the man said. \"And you've managed to teach the gods of this place how to feel. I would've been proud to have seen it, if I wasn't a dead man.\"\n\"At least you were alive once,\" Lewis cried, wiping the tears from below his eyes. \"That's better than having never lived at all.\"\n\"Is it?\" he said, and his transparency turned into invisibility. The man was gone.\n--He has gone to be with the others, gone to live deep within our universe. The others taught us, too, Lewis: a boy who died and taught us about life, a woman who was dying and taught us about pain.\n\"What about me?\" Lewis asked through his tears. \"I've fallen in love with a woman who doesn't exist outside of this--\" he gestured at the yellow pyramid and the wild cityscape that surrounded it, \"--this universe.\"\n--There is nothing more to say, Lewis. Thank you for helping us learn.\nLewis suddenly felt himself being propelled away from the shining razor-sharp gods, away from the realm of the dead and unliving. Those beings were the pantheon worshiped by the shades who dwelled in the necropolis of the net. They were creatures who were not alive, ruling over beings both more dead and more alive than themselves.\nLewis couldn't feel the heat rush in as the Concord triplex slid back into his head. All he could feel was the empty spot in his heart where a person he loved had been. A person who hadn't ever existed, except in the universe of the net -- and in Lewis' heart.\nHe dropped his board on the floor with disgust, a feeling of hatred for the entire net boiling up within him. Then the hatred turned to the pain of loss, and he began to cry.\nBehind the door in the city of baby's blocks, they felt things like never before. A man with a three-piece suit stood, solid as any normal matter, and watched them. There was a smile on his face.\nIt was a paradise, a world of green forests and bright flowers, a place without predators or blood or hate.\nIn the short green grass by the edge of the pond, Tammy and Gerry danced a silent waltz, as Charlie and Sherry looked on. Tammy, about 30 years old, smiled as she moved her young body without pain. There was no hurt -- not from her body, and not from her loneliness.\n\"They're so happy,\" Charlie said.\n\"So are we.\" Sherry kissed him softly on the cheek. Charlie laughed quietly, a laugh that came from nowhere.\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\"Nothing. I was just remembering an old joke.\"\n\"How does it go?\"\n\"Why did the chicken cross the Delaware?\"\nSherry rolled her eyes. \"Oh, no. Why DID the chicken cross the Delaware?\"\n\"To get away from George Washington.\"\nA few weeks later, Lewis felt ready to pick up the board again -- a hunk of plastic and metal, filled with everything he had ever really wanted in life. But it was just plastic and metal, with no universe inside. It was just a lie.\n`There is flesh here, but it isn't like your flesh.'\nCrying, Lewis put on the headband. He felt a wave of sickness wash over him, but he slowly put his thumb down on the touchpad.\nThe grand city in the net, spires of data. And the mainline, a giant road through it all. Deserted.\nLewis walked slowly through the empty streets of the city, looking for something, even the apparition of a suited man. It wasn't the same, somehow -- the buildings took on shapes he had never seen before, in or out of the net. It wasn't just cubes and pyramids.\n\"Lewis?\"\nHer voice was right behind him, the voice he could recognize in an instant. He turned around, and Jean was there.

Murray\nCopyright (c) 1990\nA growing trend in Science Fiction is the use of biotechnology. What is biotechnology you might ask? That is the question which I hope to answer for you in this article.\nThe first thing that I would like to point out, is that the biological sciences are one of the fastest growing fields today. The main advances are coming in genetic engineering, developmental biology, immunology, pharmaceutical development. There are also advances being made in nanotechnology, which, for the purposes of this article only, I will lump into the biotechnology field (as the only appreciable nanotechnology we now have is the purely biological equipment in every one of us).\nIn current fiction, I have seen everything from cloning, to \"little pills to cure everything\" (nanomachines that repair every damaged cell in your body) allowing one to live \"forever.\" I have also seen the engineering of animals for transportation, i.e. strap yourself onto the back of a giant cat, and drive to work at seventy kilometers per hour! Also in older works, we have tissue banks for every person, so that when they get old, or injured, you already have enough tissue mass to replace their entire body. There has also been stories where a disease is created, specific to one persons DNA, as a method to catch criminals. There have also been many cases where a gene from one species was isolated and transferred into another species.\nThese are truly amazing ideas, well worthy of being in science fiction when each of them was written. Interestingly, however, we can now do some things from the older list. We have taken the gene for producing human insulin, and placed it into an E. coli (a bacteria native to the human large intestine, that is THE subject of genetic manipulations (there are many others but none used half as much)). These have been grown in giant vats, and the insulin they produce is commercially available. This is a necessity for some people who are allergic to the more traditional sources from pigs and sheep. We have also been able to grow animal proteins out of a tobacco plant, and have increased crop productivity through genetic engineering.\nThe other thing we have been able to do is to make transplants common, but they are still too life threatening to be called routine. This is a step towards being able to replace any bodypart in anyone's body at a few days notice, assuming life support technology to keep the individual alive until such time. Another thing we have done has put us onto the path of creating the bionic man, nowadays known as a cyborg. The early steps to this are old and too large to fit inside the human body. Newer ones are capable of much more and can be implanted into the body. Of course, I'm talking about the old (but still used) iron lungs, and dialysis machines, and the newer artificial heart.\nA new, experimental contraceptive technique has been used in lab rats, using the rats own immune system to attack the sperm binding sites on her own egg, preventing fertilization from taking place. Right now it is about 75% effective for the first month, and then begins to drop off on an individual basis over the next few months. This will hopefully become a standard form of contraceptive in humans, but there is much testing left to be done - so maybe in five or ten years... [1]\nAs for the other items on the \"wish list,\" they shall remain on that list for several years. The first to appear will probably be cloning, but beware - your clone will have to grow for about 20 years before you can have an intelligent conversation with it. It will be a very impractical thing to grow a clone of a person, but it will be technologically possible. A scary possibility for the near future is the ability to create a disease so specific that it will infect only redheads (or those who carry one gene for redheadedness, since it is a recessive trait), or any person carrying on their DNA, a preselected code, thus making it possible to infect everyone who is female, while leaving the males perfectly healthy.\nThis, of course, brings up a Pandora's box of moral questions in biology. Is it right to build an entire species to serve our own needs? and if so where does it stop being acceptable, and start being slavery. Is it morally responsible to \"dial-up\" a baby to order - hair, and eye color, IQ, height, etc...? These are the questions that must be answered by the time we get to this level of technology. Did you know that in the U.S.A. it is legal to patent a new life form?\nI don't know what is feeding on what, the science fiction upon real life or vice versa, but there is a definite revolution sweeping the worlds of reality and science fiction.\n[1] Taylor, Robert, \"Zona Pellucida Peptite Blocks Fertilization\", The Journal of NIH Research, January-February 1990 Vol. II\nNorm Murray is a sophomore biology major, at Carnegie Mellon University, concentrating in genetics and computer applications in biology.

Yes, you can sit on my lap, little one. Now the rest of you, settle down and be quiet because this is going to be a good story, and you want to hear it, don't you? All right, quiet now.\nThere was a certain man who was named Duri, and he had a special skill, more than skill, it was a brilliance, a path, and he might have been the best in his time or maybe ever at what he did. See, he knew the making of the blade like no other. He was as good at it as you can ever hope to be at anything. Sarel, your father probably knows more about making blades than I do, and because the story isn't really about making blades, it's about Duri.\nDuri was a young man, young for a master of his trade, but his hands weren't young, and his soul, where it touched the blade, where it knew the blade and knew it like you each know your own faces, that wasn't young either. You don't know how it is, but maybe you will someday, how it is when you learn something so well that every detail of it fades away into a kind of dance, so smooth and beautiful that everything you do is like something out of the center of the world. He was that good, Duri was, so good that he didn't have to worry about how to hammer the steel, or how to shape it, or how to fashion a handle. His body and spirit spoke to the metal and the fire and then a blade was born.\nWhether the blade was a sword for some warrior to carve up the evil that attacked his land, or a wealthy whore's thin blade for explaining the price to a customer, it didn't matter, it was like breathing for Duri to make such fine work that you couldn't find better anywhere for all the money in the world.\nNow maybe Duri was too young to be so old, and maybe the passion that was in him was eating something inside him, too, because he wasn't really a happy man. He had money, all right, a lot of it, because anyone who wanted the best blade they could have came to Duri and wouldn't settle for less if they could help it. He had money and he had fame and he had plenty of people coming to him all the time for his work.\nMaybe he just had too much. You ever think about that, little one? You ever think about just having too much? No? Maybe you should.\nOr maybe Duri saw that his work was for hurting and killing and not much good for anything else, and maybe he was tired of that. I don't know what was in his mind when he went into the caverns past the town, where there were deep, deep lakes and dropped his newest blade, which was the best he'd ever made, into the lake where it sank right away to the bottom.\nHe let it be known that anyone who wanted that sword could have it, all they had to do was go and get it. And then he went home.\nThey say he didn't say much of anything when they told him about the first boy that had drowned trying to get the sword back up. And he didn't say much when the second boy drowned, or the third, which was a girl, or the fourth, which was a man, or any of the rest who drowned diving deep into the cavern lake looking for that sword.\nThe townspeople were pretty upset by then, and so they piled the bodies outside the cavern so that people would see them and maybe think twice about trying for the sword at the bottom of the lake.\nThey looked at Duri with a lot less respect and a lot more anger now, because young and old were dying trying to get at the sword he'd made that it seemed no one could have. They began to call the sword cursed, and the town elders called Duri up in front of them and they told him that too many people were dying because of his sword and to make it stop.\nWell Duri must have been a sight to see when they said that. He was pretty mad. He told them that they were fools and idiots if they thought he had any control over the greed in men's hearts that made them do stupid things to get at a sword they didn't need anyway.\nAnd it began to look like that sword in the lake was going to be Duri's last one. He had stopped forging blades completely. When people asked him, he told them that now only the willing would die from his work, and that was fine with him. A lot of folks were real mad when Duri stopped taking their orders for more blades, and some powerful folks got even madder and Duri didn't have a lot of friends anymore. He kept mostly to himself, and his forge was just a quiet home for spiders.\nYou're young but you probably know by now that people love to talk about other people. But if something doesn't change for a while, they get bored with it and forget about it some, and then some more, and that's what happened to Duri. The years went by and Duri didn't make any more blades, and fewer and fewer people would die trying for the sword at the bottom of the lake until hardly anyone talked about it anymore, and after a while no one believed it was really there, either. No one saw Duri very much anymore and no one particularly missed him. They could hardly even remember what he used to do.\nWhen he came out of his house at all, Duri would sit and just watch people go by. He looked older now, older than he was, probably. Maybe it had been the passion of the blades that kept him young and now that he didn't have it anymore he was aging faster. Maybe he just didn't have anything much to live for and was hurrying to die. Who knows?\nIt had been years and years since anyone had bothered to ask Duri for a blade, but his work still traveled the world and was still the best, and eventually a man who maybe hadn't heard that Duri didn't make blades anymore came around.\nThe stranger went into Duri's house and didn't come out for a long time. When he came out he looked kind of thoughtful, and he went down to the caverns. People started to talk again, because now something was happening, and people started to remember what Duri used to do and they remembered about the blade in the cavern lake and they waited to see if the man would float to the surface after he drowned diving for the sword. But the man came right back out of the caverns, walked back to Duri's house and went in to see Duri again and didn't come out again for hours.\nThe next day Duri's forge was working again. Everyone came out of their house and stared around in surprise. They watched the smoke rise, listened to the pounding, and talked with each other about what had happened. They wondered about the stranger and what he had done to make Duri forge the blade again, and they watched him as he stood waiting in front of Duri's house.\nWhen the smoke rose from the cooling of the metal it was strange and black. You see, Duri had bled himself and used his own blood to quench the thirst of the new blade. And when he was done with the blade, which was truly his finest ever, he slowly came out of his house and gave it to the stranger. Then he fell down on the ground because of all the blood he had given up. The stranger knelt down next to him and stroked his hair and spoke softly to him.\nAfter a little while, Duri died, right there in the stranger's arms.\nDon't you wish you knew what that man had said to Duri, little one? Maybe he thanked him for the sword. Maybe he just soothed Duri's way into the next world. Who knows? You'll just have to imagine.\nSo then the stranger took Duri's last sword and left, just like that, without a word, without explanation.\nSomeone must have thought about Duri some more and remembered the sword in the cavern lake and gone to look, because they say that they found the lake sword next to the cavern waters, on the bank, just after Duri died. And it was all red, just like blood.\nThey decided to bury the lake sword with Duri because it seemed proper. That night someone took it, though, stole the sword right out of the ground where it lay next to Duri, and no one ever saw it again.\nAnd that was the end of Duri and his fine blades.\nWhat's that? Oh, I said it was a good story, child, I didn't say it was a nice one.\nYou want to know what it means? Yes, of course you do.\nMaybe that was Duri's problem, too. Everyone told him what everything meant, what he was and what he should do. He was born with a great light inside him and everyone told him how to shine the light outwards and make fine blades with it, but no one ever said anything about how to shine it inside first. Maybe they just didn't know how themselves. But maybe if Duri had used a little of his light to see his own way with he wouldn't have had to give birth to my sword with his dying blood.\nYes, the blade I carry, this one, this is the blade that Duri made in his own blood.\nYes, child, really.\nNow you know that a woman can bear a baby in blood but a man can't. You, little one, you'll know this someday as I never can. A man can't make something come alive, only a woman can do that, and that is why woman is the greatest power in this world. Death is a door to somewhere, somewhere else, but the giving of life is the first magic of life. Every breath you take is from the magic of life and anything you lay your hands on to change is from the magic of your breath.\nDuri wanted to make something out of the magic of life, make something of his own body, like a woman would bear a child. And I think he wanted to finally make a blade that would taste his own blood before it tasted anyone else's. But that's just what I think.\nAnd now I've gone and told you what the story means and I didn't want to do that. But you shouldn't listen to what I tell you, anyway. No one can tell you what a story means, just like no one can tell you what you are because no one can tell you what you already know.\nAll right. That's the story I wanted to tell and it's only words and that's just about enough words for the moment. I'll put this sword down here so that you can all look at it if you want to. You know that blades are sharp, don't you? So don't touch it.\nNo, no, that's not right. Go ahead and touch it, if that's what's in you to do. Go ahead and touch what Duri made, what he died to make. Mingle your blood with his. See yourself in his reflection, and remember.\nSonia is a software engineer by trade. She has been writing fiction off on and on since she was able to read and write.

Three days since she lost her grip and slid off into the cold blackness. She knew now she had been overconfident about maneuvering in zero gee. No one had seen her slide off into space; she had been maneuvering outside on the crew's sleep shift, without telling anyone where she was going, so she wouldn't be disturbed in her research. She was alone, with little hope of rescue.\nShe had sent out calls on her radio until it began to consume power she needed for the heating unit in her suit. She wasn't sure if she'd heard a reply - sensory deprivation had been causing intermittent hallucinations after the first eight hours. She didn't realize how bad it was until she found herself back in her playroom from her childhood at home, sitting in front of her dollhouse. She wondered if she'd recover her sanity if a ship picked her up.\nThe hallucinations added stimuli to the emptiness around her. The only view was the endlessly unchanging starfield, and the only sound the rhythm of her breathing. No one had ever been so alone, she thought, as she remembered those hectic days on the ship where she had wished for complete solitude. Now she craved the stress, the constant flow of information.\nShe kept turning because she was sure she heard something dark and misty moaning behind her. It tried to grab her and she pushed it back, then fell into the waves of space washing over her. Cold sweat brought her back to reality momentarily. Shudders went through her. She realized, looking at her gauges, that her oxygen would soon run out. She was about to die alone. She used all the power in her suit for one last radio squirt. Perhaps when they found her they could bury her in a crowded cemetery. She didn't want to be alone forever.\nThe silence screamed at her once again and she turned to face it. Space came back to life around her. She tried to keep it from clawing at her, felt a burning in her chest and realized she was bleeding over the clean white tile. She fell to her knees in her kitchen, felt the man stab her again and became dizzy with the loss of blood. She turned back to the darkness and felt the beast with its tentacles wrapped around her pulling her into its maw. She opened her eyes once more to the stars; they quickly fell shut and the night embraced her.\nThe roaring forced her back to consciousness. She tried to run from it, but was unable to move. She opened her eyes and stared into a bright light which made a halo around the head of the man who stood before her. \"You're safe now,\" said the man.

A week ago he had returned from Myanmar, the country once known as Burma, and now, after two days of drugs and fasting, he was prepared: he had become an alien, at home in a distant landscape.\nHis brain was filled with blossoms of fire, their spread white flesh torched to yellow, the center of a burning world. On the dark stained oak door, angel wings danced in blue flame, their faces beatific in the cold fire. Staring at the animated carved figures, Gonzales thought, `the fire is in my eyes, in my brain.'\nHe pushed down the s-curved brass handle and stepped through to the hallway, his split-toed shoes of soft cotton and rope scuffing without noise across floors of bleached oak. Through the open door at the hallway's end, morning's light through stained glass made abstract patterns of crimson and buttery yellow. Inside the room, a blue monitor console stood against the far wall, SenTrax corporate sunburst glowing on its face; in the center of the room was the egg, split hemispheres of chromed steel, cracked and waiting. One half-egg was filled with beige tubes and snakes of optic cable, the other half with hard dark plastic lying slack against the shell.\nGonzales rubbed his hands across his eyes, then pulled his hair back into a long hank and slipped a circle of elastic over it. He reached to his waist and grabbed the bottom hem of his navy blue t-shirt and pulled the shirt over his head. Dropping it to the floor, he kicked off his shoes, stepped out of baggy tan pants and loose white cotton underpants and stood naked, his pale skin gleaming with a light coat of sweat. His skin felt hot, eyes grainy, stomach sore.\nHe stepped up and into a chrome half-egg, then shivered and lay back as body-warmth liquid bled into the slack plastic, which began to balloon underneath him. He took hold of finger-thick cables and pushed their junction ends home into the sockets set in the back of his neck. As the egg continued to fill, he fit a mask over his face, felt its edges seal, and inhaled. Catheters moved toward his crotch, iv needles toward the crooks of both arms. The egg shut closed on him and liquid spilled into its interior.\nHe floated in silence, waiting, breathing slowly and deeply as elation punched through the chaotic mix of emotions generated by drugs, meditation, and the egg. No matter that he was going to relive his own terror, this was what moved him: access to the many-worlds of human experience--travel through space, time, and probability all in one.\nVirtual realities were everywhere--virtual vacations, sex, superstardom, you name it--but compared to the egg, they were just high-res videogames or stage magic. VRs used a variety of tricks to simulate physical presence, but the sensorium could be fooled only to a certain degree, and when you inhabited a VR, you were conscious of it, so sustaining its illusion depended on willing suspension of disbelief. With the egg, however, you got total involvement through all sensory modalities--the worlds were so compelling that people waking from them often seemed lost in the waking world, as if it were a dream.\nA needle punched into a membrane set in one of the neural cables and injected a neuropeptide mix. Gonzales was transported.\nIt was the final day of Gonzales's three week stay in Pagan, the town in central Myanmar where the government had moved its records decades earlier, in the wake of ethnic rioting in Yangon. He sat with Grossback, the Division Head of SenTrax Myanmar, at a central rosewood table in the main conference room. The table's work stations, embedded oblongs of glass, lay dark and silent in front of them.\nGonzales had come to Myanmar to do an information audit. The local SenTrax group supplied the Federated State of Myanmar with its primary information utilities: all its records of personnel and materiel, and all transactions among them. A month earlier, SenTrax Myanmar's reports had triggered \"look-see\" alarms in the home company's passive auditing programs, and Gonzales and his memex had been sent to look more closely at the raw data.\nSo for twenty straight days Gonzales and the memex had explored data structures and their contents, testing nominal functional relationships against reality. Wherever there were movements of information, money, equipment or personnel, there were records, and the two followed. They searched cash trails, matched purchase orders to services and materiel, verified voucher signatures with personnel records, cross-checked the personnel records themselves against government databases, and traced the backgrounds and movements of the people they represented; they read contracts and back-chased to their bid and acquisition; they verified daily transaction logs.\nHard, slogging work, all patience and detail, and so far it had shown nothing but the usual inefficiencies--Grossback didn't run a particularly taut operation, but, as of the moment, he didn't seem to have a corrupt one. However, neither he nor SenTrax Myanmar was cleared yet; Gonzales's final report would come later, after he and the memex had analyzed the records at their leisure.\nGonzales stretched and rubbed his eyes. As usual at the end of short-term, intensive gigs like this, he felt tired, washed- out, eager to go. He said to Grossback, \"I've got a company plane out of here late this afternoon to Bangkok. I'll connect with whatever commercial flight's available there.\"\nGrossback smiled, obviously glad Gonzales was leaving. Grossback was a slight man, of mixed German and Thai descent; he had a light brown complexion, black hair, and delicate features. He wore politically correct clothing in the old-fashioned Burmese style: a dark skirt called a `longyi', a white cotton shirt.\nDuring Gonzales's time there, Grossback had dealt with him coldly and correctly from behind a mask of corporate protocol and clenched teeth. `Fair enough', Gonzales had thought: the man's operation was suspect, and him along with it. Anyway, people resented these outside intrusions almost every time; representing Internal Affairs, Gonzales answered only to his division head, F.L. Traynor, and SenTrax Board, and that made almost everyone nervous.\n\"You leaving out of Myaung U Airport?\" Grossback asked.\n\"No, I've asked for a pick-up south of town.\" Like anyone else who could arrange it, he was not going to fly out of Pagan's official airport, where partisan groups had several times brought down aircraft. Surely Grossback knew that.\nGrossback asked, \"What will your report say?\"\nSurprised, Gonzales said, \"You know I can't tell you anything about that.\" Even mentioning the matter constituted an embarrassment, not to mention a reportable violation of corporate protocol. The man was either stupid or desperate.\n\"You haven't found anything,\" Grossback said.\nWhat was his problem? Gonzales said, \"I have a year's data to examine before I can make an assessment.\"\n\"You won't tell me what the preliminary report will look like,\" Grossback said. His face had gone cold.\n\"No,\" said Gonzales. He stood and said, \"I have to finish packing.\" For the moment, he just wanted to get out before Grossback did something irretrievable, like threatening him or offering a bribe. \"Goodbye,\" Gonzales said. The other man said nothing as Gonzales left the room.\nGonzales returned to the Thiripyitsaya Hotel, a collection of low bungalows fabricated from bamboo and ferro-concrete that stood above the Irrawady River. The rooms were afflicted by Myanmar's tattered version of Asian tourist decor: lacquered bamboo on the walls, along with leaping dragon holos, black teak dresser, tables, chairs, and bed frame, ceiling fans that had wandered in from the twentieth century--just to give your average citizen that rush of the Exotic East, Gonzales figured. However, the hotel had been rebuilt less than a decade before, so, by local standards, Gonzales had luxury: working climatizer, microwave, and refrigerator.\nOf course, many nights the air conditioner didn't work, and Gonzales lay sweaty and semi-conscious through hot, humid nights then was greeted just after dawn by lizards fanning their ruby neck flaps and doing push ups.\nHe had gotten up several of those mornings and walked the cart paths that threaded the plains around Pagan, passing among the temples and pagodas as the sun rose and turned the morning mist into a huge veil of luminous pink, with the towers sticking up like fairy castles. Everywhere around Pagan were the temples, thousands of them, young and flourishing when William the Conqueror was king. Now, quick-fab structures housing government agencies nested among thousand year old pagodas, some in near perfect condition, like Thatbyinnu Temple, myriad others no more than ruins and forgotten names. You gained merit by building pagodas, not by keeping up those built by someone long dead.\nLike some other Southeast Asian countries, Myanmar still was trying to recover from late-twentieth century politics; in Myanmar's case, its decades-long bout with round-robin military dictatorships and the chaos that came in their wake. And as was so often the case in politically wobbly countries, it still restricted access to the worldnet; through various kinds of governments, its leaders had found the prospect of free information flow unacceptable. Ka-band antennas were expensive, their use licensed by permits almost impossible to get. As a result, Gonzales and the memex had been like meat eaters stranded among vegetarians, unable to get their nourishment.\nHe'd taken down the memex that morning. Its functions dormant, it lay nestled inside one of his two fiber and aluminum shock-cases, ready for transport. The other case held memory boxes containing SenTrax Myanmar group's records.\nWhen they got home, Gonzales would tell the memex the latest news about Grossback, how the man had cracked at the last moment. Gonzales was sure the m-i would think what he did--Grossback was dog dirty and scared they would find it.\nAt the edge of a sandy field south of Pagan, Gonzales waited for his plane. Gonzales wore his usual international traveller's mufti, a tan gabardine two-piece suit over an open-collared white linen shirt, dark brown slipover shoes. His hair was gathered back into a ponytail held together by a silver ring made from lizard figures joined head-to-tail. Next to him sat a soft brown leather bag and the two shock-cases.\nIn front of him a pagoda climbed in a series of steeples to a gilded and jeweled umbrella top, pointing to heaven. On its steps, beside the huge paw of a stone lion, a monk sat in full lotus, his face shadowed by the animal rising massive and lumpy and mock fierce above him. The lion's flanks were dyed orange by sunset, its lips stained the color of dried blood. The minutes passed, and the monk's voice droned, his face in shadow.\n\"Come tour the temples of ancient Pagan,\" a voice said. \"Shwezigon, Ananda, Thatbyinnu--\"\n\"Go away,\" Gonzales said to the tour cart that had rolled up behind him. It would hold two dozen or so passengers in eight rows of narrow wooden benches but was now empty--almost all the tourists would have joined the crush on the terraces of Thatbyinnu, where they could watch the sun set over the temple plain.\n\"Last tour of the day,\" the cart said. \"Very cheap, also very good exchange rate offered as courtesy to visitors.\"\nIt wanted to exchange kyats for dollars or yen: in Myanmar, even the machines worked the black market. \"No thanks.\"\n\"Extremely good rate, sir.\"\n\"Fuck off,\" Gonzales said. \"Or I'll report you as defective.\" The cart whirred as it moved away.\nGonzales watched a young monk eyeing him from the other side of the road, ready to come across and beg for pencils or money. Gonzales caught the monk's eye and shook his head. The monk shrugged and walked on, his orange robe billowing.\n`Where the hell was his plane?' Soon hunter flares would cut into the new moon's dark, and government drones would scurry around the edges of the shadows like huge mutant bats. Upcountry Myanmar trembled on the edge of chaos, beset by a multi-ethnic mix of Karens, Kachins, and Shans in various political postures, all fierce, all contemptuous of the central government. They fought with whatever was at hand, from sharpened stick to backpack missile, and they only quit when they died.\nA high-pitched wail built quickly until it filled the air. Within seconds a silver swing-wing, an ungainly thing, each huge rectangular wing loaded with a bulbous, oversized engine pod, came low over the dark mass of forest. Its running lights flashing red and yellow, the swing-wing slewed to a stop above the field, wings tilting to the perpendicular and engine sound dropping into the bass. Its spots picked out a ten-meter circle of white light that the aircraft dropped into, blowing clouds of sand that swept over Gonzales in a whirlwind. The inverted fans' roar dropped to a whisper, and with a creak the plane kneeled on its gear, placing the cockpit almost on the ground. Gonzales picked up his bags and walked toward the plane. A ladder unfolded with a hydraulic hiss, and Gonzales stepped up and into the plane's bubble.\n\"Mikhail Gonzales?\" the pilot asked. His multi-function flight glasses were tilted back on his forehead, where their mirrored ovoid lenses made a blank second pair of eyes; a thin strand of black fiberoptic cable trailed from their rim. Beneath the glasses, his thin face was brown and seamed-- `no cosmetic work for this guy', Gonzales thought. The man wore a throwaway \"tropical\" shirt with dancing pink flamingos on a navy blue background.\n\"That's me,\" Gonzales said. He gestured with the shock-case in his right hand, and the pilot toggled a switch that opened the luggage locker. Gonzales put his bags into the steel compartment and watched as the safety net pulled tight against the bags and the compartment door closed. He took a seat in the first of eight empty rows behind the pilot. Cushions sighed beneath him, and from the seatback in front of him a feminine voice said, \"You should engage your harness. If you need instructions, please say so now.\"\nGonzales snapped closed the trapezoidal catch where shoulder and lap belts connected, then stretched against the harness, feeling the sweat dry on his skin in the plane's cool interior. \"Thank you,\" said the voice.\nThe pilot was speaking to Myaung U Airport traffic control as the plane lifted into twilight over the city. The soft white glow from the dome light vanished, then there were only the last moments of orange sunlight coming through the bubble.\nThe temple plain was spread out beneath, all murk and shadow, with the temple and pagoda spires reaching up toward the light, white stucco and gold tinted red and orange.\n\"Man, that's a beautiful sight,\" the pilot said.\n\"You're right,\" Gonzales said. It was, but he'd seen it before, and besides, it had already been a long day.\nThe pilot flipped his glasses down, and the plane banked left and headed south along the river. Gonzales lay back in his seat and tried to relax.\nThey flew above black water, following the Irrawady River until they crossed an international flyway to Bangkok. Dozing in the interior darkness, Gonzales was almost asleep when he heard the pilot say, \"Shit, somebody's here. Partisan attack group, probably--no recognition codes. Must be flying ultralights--our radar didn't see them. We've got an image now, though.\"\n\"Any problem?\" Gonzales asked.\n\"Just coming for a look. They don't bother foreign charters.\" And he pointed to their transponder message flashing above the primary displays:\nTHIS INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT IS NON-MILITARY. IT CLAIMS RIGHT OF PASSAGE UNDER U.N. ACT OF 2020.\nIt would keep on repeating until they crossed into Thai airspace.\nThe flight computer display lit bright red with COLLISION WARNING, and a Klaxon howl filled the plane's interior. The pilot said, \"Fuck, they launched!\" The swing-wing's turbines screamed full out as the plane's computer took command, and the pilot's hands gripped his yoke, not guiding, just hanging on.\nGonzales's straps pulled tight as the plane tumbled and fell, corkscrewed, looped, climbed again--smart metal fish evading fiery harpoons. Explosions blossomed in the dark, quick asymmetrical bursts of flame followed immediately by hard thumping sounds and shock waves that knocked the swing-wing as it followed its chaotic path through the night.\nThen an aircraft appeared, flaring in fire that surged around it, its pilot in blazing outline--a stick figure with arms thrown to the sky in the instant before pilot and aircraft disintegrated in flame.\nTheir own flight went steady and level, and control returned to the pilot's yoke. Gonzales's shocked retinas sparkled as the night returned to blackness. \"Collision averted,\" the plane's computer said. \"Time in red zone, six point eight nine seconds.\"\n\"What the hell?\" Gonzales said. \"What happened?\"\n\"Holy Jesus motherfucker,\" the pilot said.\nGonzales sat gripping his seat, chilled by the blast of cold air from the plane's air conditioner onto his sweat-soaked shirt. He glanced down to his lap: no, he hadn't pissed himself. Really, everything happened too quickly for him to get that scared.\nA Mitsubishi-McDonnell \"Loup Garou\" warplane dived in front of them and circled in slow motion. Like the ultralights it was cast in matte black, but with a massive fuselage. It turned a slow barrel roll as it circled them, lazy predator looping fat, slow prey, then turned on brilliant floods that played across their canopy.\nThe pilot and Gonzales both froze in the glare.\nThen the Loup Garou's black cockpit did a reverse-fade; behind the transparent shell Gonzales saw the mirror-visored pilot, twin cables running from the base of his neck. The Loup Garou's wings slid forward into reverse-sweep, and it stood on its tail and disappeared.\nGonzales strained against his taut harness.\n\"Assholes!\" the pilot screamed.\n\"Who was that?\" Gonzales asked, his voice thin and shaking. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"The Myanmar Air Force,\" the pilot said, his voice tight, face red beneath the flight glasses' mirrors. \"They set us up, the pricks. They used us to troll for a guerrilla flight.\" The pilot flipped up his glasses and stared with pointless intensity out the cockpit window, as if he could see through the blackness. \"And waited,\" he said. \"Waited till they had the whole flight.\" The pilot swiveled around abruptly and faced Gonzales, his features distorted into a mad and angry caricature of the man who had welcomed Gonzales ninety minutes before. \"Do you know how fucking close we came?\" he asked.\nNo, Gonzales shook his head. No.\n\"Milliseconds, man. Fucking milliseconds. Close enough to touch,\" the pilot said. He swiveled his seat to face forward, and Gonzales heard its locking mechanism click as he settled back into his own seat, fear and shame spraying a wild neurochemical mix inside his brain--\nGonzales had never felt things like this before--death down his spine and up his gut, up his throat and nose, as close as his skin; death with a bad smell...burning, burning.\nAs the morning passed, the sun moved away from the stained glass, and the room's interior went to gloom. Only monitor lights remained lit, steady rows of green above flickering columns of numbers on the light blue face of the monitor panel.\nA housekeeping robot, a pod the size of a large goose, worked slowly across the floor, nuzzled into the room's corners, then left the room, its motion tentacles beneath it making a sound like wind through dry grass.\nThe cockpit display flashed as landing codes fed through the flight computer, then the swing-wing locked into the Bangkok landing grid and began its slide down an invisible pipe. They went to touchdown guided by electronic hands.\nThe pilot turned to Gonzales as they descended and said, \"I'll have to file a report on the attack. But you're lucky--if we had landed in Myanmar, government investigators would have been on you like white on rice, and you could forget about leaving for days, maybe weeks. You're okay now: by the time they process the report and ask the Thais to hold you, you'll be gone.\"\nAt the moment, the last thing Gonzales wanted to do was spend any time in Myanmar. \"I'll get out as quickly as I can,\" he said.\nNow that it was all over, he could feel the Fear climbing in him like the onset of a dangerous drug. Trying to calm himself, he thought, `really, nothing happened, except you got the shit scared out of you, that's all.'\nAs the swing-wing settled on the pad, Gonzales stood and went to pick up his luggage from the open baggage hold. The pilot sat watching as the plane went through its shutdown procedures.\n`Do something,' Gonzales said to himself, feeling panic mount. He pulled the memex's case out of the hold and said, \"I want a copy of your flight records.\"\n\"I can't do that.\"\n\"You can. I'm working with Internal Affairs, and I was almost killed while flying in your aircraft.\"\n\"So was I, man.\"\n\"Indeed. But I need this data. Later, IA will go the full official route and pick everything up, but I need it now. A quick dump into my machine here, that's all it will take. I'll give you authorization and receipt.\" Gonzales waited, keeping the pressure on by his insistent gaze and posture.\nThe pilot said, \"Okay, that ought to cover my ass.\"\nGonzales slid the shock-case next to the pilot's seat, kneeled and opened the lid. \"Are you recording?\" he asked the pilot.\nThe man nodded and said, \"Always.\"\n\"That's what I thought. All right, then: for the record, this is Mikhail Mikhailovitch Gonzales, senior employee of Internal Affairs Division, SenTrax. I am acquiring flight records of this aircraft to assist in my investigation of certain events that occurred during its most recent flight.\" He looked at the pilot. \"That should do it,\" he said.\nHe pulled out a data lead from the case and snapped it into the access plug on the instrument panel. Lights flashed across the panel as data began to spool into the quiescent memex. The panel gonged softly to signal transfer was complete, and Gonzales unplugged the lead and closed the case. \"Thanks,\" he said to the pilot, who sat staring out the cockpit bubble.\nGonzales stood and patted the case and thought to himself, `hey, memex, got a surprise for you when you wake up.' He felt much better.\nA carry-slide hauled Gonzales a mile or so through a brightly- lit tunnel with baby blue plastic and plaster walls marked with signs in half a dozen languages promising swift retribution for vandalism. Red and green virus graffiti smeared everything, signs included, and as Gonzales watched, messages in Thai and Burmese transmuted, and new stick figures emerged with dialogue balloons saying god knows what. A lone phrase in red paint read in English, HEROIN ALPHA DEVIL FLOWER. Shattered boxes of black fibroid or coarse sprays of multi-wire cable marked where surveillance cameras had been.\nGrey floor-to-ceiling steel shutters blocked the narrow portal to International Arrivals and Departures. Faceless holoscan robots--dark, wheeled cubes with carbon-fiber armor and tentacles and spiked sensor antennas--worked the crowd, antennas swiveling.\nAll around were Asian travelers, dark-suited men and women: Japanese, Chinese, Malaysians, Indonesians, Thai. They spread out from Asia's \"dragons,\" world centers of research and manufacturing, taking their low margins and hard sell to Europe and the Americas, where consumption had become a way of life. Everywhere Gonzales traveled, it seemed, he found them: cadres armed with technical and scientific prowess and fueled by persistent ambition.\nThey formed the steel core of much of the world's prosperity. The United States and the dragons lived in uneasy symbiosis: the Asians had a hundred ways of making sure the American economy didn't just roll over and die and take the prime North American consumer market with it. Whether Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Hong Kong Chinese-Canadians--they bought some corporations and merged with others, and Americans ended up working for General Motors Fanuc, Chrysler Mitsubishi, or Daewoo-DEC, and with their paychecks they bought Japanese memexes, Korean autos, Malaysian robotics.\nShutter blades cranked open with a quick scream of metal, and Gonzales stepped inside. An Egyptian guard in a white headdress, blue-and-white checked headband, and gray U.N. drag cross-checked his i.d., gave a quick, meaningless smile--teeth white and perfect under a black moustache--and waved him on.\nSoutheast Asian Faction Customs waited in the form of a small Thai woman in a brown uniform with indecipherable scrawls across yellow badges. Her features were pleasant and impassive; she wore her black hair pulled tightly back and held with a clear plastic comb. She stood behind a gray metal table; on the floor next to it was a two-meter high general purpose scanner, its controls, screens, and read-outs hidden under a black cloth hood. Dirty green walls wore erratically-spaced signs in a dozen languages, detailing in small type the many categories of contraband.\nThe woman motioned for him to sit in the upright chair in front of the table, then for him to put his clothes bag and cases on the table.\nShe spoke, and the translator box at her waist echoed in clear, neuter machine English: \"Your person has been scanned and cleared.\" She put the soft brown bag into the mouth of the scanner, and the machine vetted the bag with a quiet beep. The woman slid it back to Gonzales.\nShe spoke again, and the translator said, \"Please open these cases\" as she pointed toward the two shock-cases. For each, Gonzales screened the access panel with his left hand and tapped in the entry codes with his right. The case lids lifted with a soft sigh. Inside the cases, monitor and diagnostic lights flashed above rows of memory modules, heavy solids of black plastic the size of a small safety deposit box.\nGonzales saw she was holding a copy of the Data Declaration Form the memex had filled out in Myanmar and transmitted to both Myanmar and Thai governments. She looked into one of the cases and pointed to a row of red-tagged and sealed memory modules.\nThe translator's words followed behind hers and said, \"These modules we must hold to verify that they contain no contraband information.\"\n\"Myanmar customs did so. These are SenTrax corporate records.\"\n\"Perhaps they are. We have not cleared them.\"\n\"If you wish, I will give you the access protocols. I have nothing to hide, but the modules are important to my work.\"\nShe smiled. \"I do not have proper equipment. They must be examined by authorities in the city.\" The translator's tones accurately reflected her lack of concern.\nGonzales sensed the onset of severe bureaucratic intransigence. For whatever occult reasons, this woman had decided to fuck him around, and the harder he pushed, the worse things would be. Give it up, then. He said, \"I assume they will be returned to me as soon as possible.\"\n\"Certainly. After careful examination. Though it is unlikely that the examination can be completed before your departure.\" She slid the case off her desk and to the floor behind it. She was smiling again, a satisfied bureaucrat's smile. She turned back to her console, Gonzales's case already a thing of the past. She looked up to see him still standing there and said, \"How else can I help you?\"\nThe machine-world began to disperse, turning to fog, and as it did, banks of low-watt incandescents lit up around the room's perimeter, and the patterns of console lights went through a series of rapid permutations as Gonzales was brought to a waking state. The room's lights had been full up for an hour when the desynching series was complete and the egg began to split.\nInside the egg Gonzales lay pale, nude, near-comatose, machine-connected: a new millennium Snow White. A flesh-colored catheter led from his water-shrunken genitals, transparent iv feeds from both forearms. White sealant and anti-irritant paste had clotted around the tubes from throat and mouth. The sharp ozone smell of the paste was all over him.\nAn autogurney had rolled next to the egg, and its hands, shining chrome claws, began disconnecting tubes and leads. Then it worked with hands and black flexible arms the thickness of a stout rope to lift Gonzales from the egg and onto its own surface.\nGonzales woke up in his own bedroom and began to whimper. \"It's okay,\" the memex whispered through the room's speaker. \"It's okay.\"\nSome time later Gonzales awoke again, lay in gloom and considered his condition. Some nausea, legs weak, but no apparent loss of gross motor control, no immediate parapsychological effects (disorientations, amnesias, synesthesias) ...\nGonzales got up and went to the bathroom, stood amid white tile, polished aluminum and mirrors and said, \"Warm shower.\" Water hissed, and the shower stall door swung open. The water ran down his skin and the sweat and paste rolled off his body.\nTom Maddox has published stories in _Omni_, _Isaac Asimov's SF Magazine_, and in anthologies and magazines in the U.

What keen satisfaction it would give him to smite these shabby oafs, with their bulging eyes riveted to his progress and their dirt-smudged faces predictable masks of cruel delight or stupid pity.\nSorrille, it must be conceded, was a bit of an arrogant bastard.\nThe townsfolk watched him dumbly at first, too conscious of his former power to risk their scrawny necks taunting him. But as he neared the city gates it began to dawn on them that he would like as not never return to repay their rude treatment of him, and they rose to the occasion accordingly. Women lifted their aprons to their mouths and tittered as their young brats hurled scraps of rotten food and clods of dung at his head. A toothless old man hopped up and down on one leg in a fit of ecstatic mirth, then swung his balancing stick roundly at Sorrille's shin. One of the guards flanking Sorrille gave the old gargoyle a friendly shove that toppled him into a mud puddle.\n``Now, now, venerable grandpap, this here's a royal subject and his escort. Mind yer manners,'' the guard guffawed, giving Sorrille an insultingly familiar slap on the back. Sorrille curled his lip savagely, unable to decide who he would thrash to a pulp first---guard or gaffer---were he suddenly given the opportunity to do so.\n``Say there, lordling, send us yer bones from the Charred Lands so's we'll know yer made yer trip safely,'' called a paunchy shopkeeper, grinning obscenely as he clapped his hands to his jouncing belly.\n``Oi don't know,'' countered a stableboy, clutching at Sorrille's cloak, ``but what he'd do more kerreck to berkweeth us his foinery now. The Children of the Charred Lands ain't pertickelar on how their victims is dressed.''\nSorrille pulled himself free of the creature's stinking grip and struggled briefly but earnestly with the rope pretzeled about his wrists. ``Don't tempt your fate, dropping. I'll see to it that your coffin is fit for Onri himself.''\nThe stableboy laughed shrilly. ``Oh, en ain't he a foine one fer threats. Where he's going there won't even be none to tuck him underground. May the jeckels foind yer corpse most deloightfully tasty, good me lord.'' His pseudo-court bow, complete with manual flourishes, sent the guard at Sorrille's left elbow into convulsions of nasal glee.\n``See how respectful we all are,'' he said, between snorts, ``even to one''---here he preceded his words with the appropriate action---``who's about to be booted from the city.''\nSorrille rolled up from the ground as the stone gate whined plaintively to a close behind him. The peepdoor opened just long enough for the guard behind it to drop a tiny bone dagger and a handkerchief-full of biscuits at Sorrille's feet. ``Protection and wayfarin' provisions,'' chuckled the guard, before slamming the door briskly in Sorrille's face.\nMuttering under his breath, Sorrille spent the next several minutes applying the minuscule blade of the dagger to his bonds, which frayed sufficiently at last for him to work his hands free. He slipped the dagger into his tunic belt without any real faith in its future utility, then turned to gather the meager contents of the handkerchief, which had spilled loose on contact with the ground. ``Sons of dogs,'' he hissed, scraping the dust from what might well be the last meal he would ever eat.\nFor the next several hours, as he plodded across the ugly stretch of bare plain surrounding Renith, Sorrille did little but reflect bitterly on the many advantages of the royal table. For one thing, one always left it with one's stomach satiated. For another, its multitudinous delicacies were invariably accompanied by an endless flow of mildly intoxicating---and thirst-quenching ---potations. Then, last but not least, one was invited to attend it no less than four times daily, and while a score of musicians and dancers might very well appear out of nowhere to entertain one, it was inconceivable that either fanged rodents or fist-sized flies would ever be allowed to join the festivities.\nFlailing his arms furiously at an especially noisy and persistent specimen of the second category, Sorrille began to regret having exhausted his supply of biscuits so rapidly. True, he had not eaten for two days prior to being paraded through and then expelled from the city; the king's henchmen had tactfully ignored his existence from the moment they thrust him into the palace dungeons to the moment they returned to execute His Most August and Senile Majesty Onri's sentence upon poor hotheaded ex-Duke Sorrille. Unfortunately, though, Sorrille was now entirely without any likely prospects of obtaining life-sustaining nourishment, and thirsty as a bloodsucker to boot. Sometime tomorrow, if he kept up a rigorous pace, he might reach the Ashen Forest's cornucopia of snowberries, bone fruit, and mirkwater. But to partake of aught of the Forest's tempting bounty would quickly ensure that Sorrille became not one of the Shadowchildren's victims but rather one of their numbers.\nSorrille toyed sardonically with the notion that were he in fact metamorphosed into a deathless and lifeless ghoul, he could probably catch up with Onri on the next extra-urban hunting expedition and hasten the old boor's end with an exquisitely nightmarish haunting. Of course, his own existence thenceforward would hardly be an enviable one. No, he reasoned, with a forbearance uncharacteristic of him, that manner of revenge would clearly cost him far too much. Better to meet Onri's insane challenge---to return to Renith with a tame, captive Shadowchild---and behold the king dumbstruck with apoplexy when he learned that his challenge had been met. The doddering bastard's crown would be brusquely removed from his head and set gently on Sorrille's own, Onri's radiant young Belisa would joyously accept his marriage proposal, and every courtier who had ever done him an ill turn would be summarily drawn-and-quartered, or, better yet, driven screaming off a cliff by his pet Shadowchild. It was no doubt a plan of action with much to recommend it, provided Sorrille discovered, within the next day, how to avert certain death and then coax a supernatural nemesis to behave itself.\nFor the time being, however, he would have to concentrate on such minor though pressing matters as how to avert pangs of hunger and where to spend the night. In solution to the first problem, Sorrille seized a handful of scrubby plains clover and began to chew it greedily; the shepherds and cartdrivers of Lower Renith did swear by it, after all, as a `rousin' stimulant,'' and while the stuff surely wouldn't fill his stomach, it might at least hoodwink it into quiescence. The second problem was considerably larger, as the plains wind was a wild and ravenous beast by night. Unless Sorrille could find or devise some sort of shelter by sunset, he was likely to spend the next moonspan being knocked down and tumbled about till his clothes were tattered and his limbs bruised and bloody. After surveying the discouragingly level landscape before him for several minutes, Sorrille concluded that there was nary a tree nor shrub to hide behind or cling to. Then, with a burst of what felt like forced and desperate optimism, he spotted a greyish blotch not too far in the distance which might conceivably be a rock outcrop of some sort. Resigning himself to the possibility that he was travelling all-too-eagerly toward a nonexistent haven he reminded himself repeatedly that it was just as good a destination as any other.\nAs luck would have it, the blotch was much further off than Sorrille had guessed. The disc of the sun had turned from hot gold to warm peach to an ominously cool carmine and begun to slip below the horizon before he felt even vaguely like he had gotten anywhere. Determined nonetheless to reach his goal, he quickened his already lively pace in a last-ditch attempt to outrace the twilight. He was dourly preparing to entertain notions of defeat when a luminous whorl of milky air came spinning up to greet him.\n``Curse the plains and the dog-gods who made them!'' Sorrille bellowed, by way of greeting, then broke into a thoroughly antisocial run. It wasn't until the glistening funnel-cloud had enveloped him without so much as flaring his cloak hem that he realized that being battered by the plains wind was the least of his current worries. For, standing in a triumphant circle around him, their diaphanous wings folded, their black nostrils and lips twitching, were four Shadowchildren. Time froze then, for an unspeakably long moment in which countless worlds came into and passed out of existence, and Sorrille watched with helpless fascination as the silver branches of the creatures' hair crackled and hissed like snow-crusted kindling on a winter fire. A pair of shimmering claws began to caress his face with an eerie, hypnotic tenderness, and he found himself sinking pleasantly and endlessly into a deep cavern pool whose dark waters streamed with phosphorescent tendrils. Lulled nearly to insensibility, he recollected somehow that he must surface for air. Proud that his instinct for survival could withstand even the delicious pull of enchanted slumber, he willed himself alert, blinking hard to bring the blurry twin red orbs before him into focus. Finally, his vision cleared, and he met the Shadowchild's blind steady gaze directly. Gods be damned! He had withstood nothing; while he had been doing the backfloat in his imaginary watering-hole, the Children had been collectively sucking at his thoughts like a gang of slithering lampreys. Growing faint with the effort, Sorrille managed to wrench his head sideways and down until the only thing he saw was an elongated, insubstantial foot. The Children convulsed with disappointment, and the one who had been peeping uninvited into the windows of his soul caressed his face once again, with the insistent frenzy of a newly cast-off lover.\n``Do not deny us, Sorrille,'' it coaxed. Its voice was soundless yet reverberant, rather like wind scraping the barrel of a tongueless bell.\n``You meant to seek us,'' another intoned. ``Do not despair if we have found you first.''\n``Are we not wondrous to behold?'' inquired a third. ``As lovely as Belisa?'' For a fraction of a second, the Child's voice took on Belisa's very air of well-practiced coquetry, and Sorrille could picture the creature raising a claw artfully to its scintillant coiffure. He shuddered to realize how deep a draught of his mind the four had drunk in. He fought not to look up and meet the Childrens' eyes again, meanwhile wondering whether the fact of their obvious blindness could not somehow be used to his advantage.\n``What is it you want?'' he demanded, as if he were addressing a peasant rabble and standing in a perfectly upright and authoritative position.\n``What is it we want?'' came the mocking reply.\n``What is it we want?''\n``We want to sup on your heart.'' The caressing claws found their way to Sorrille's chest. ``Is it a kind heart?''\n``Is it a bold heart? or a bitter heart?''\n``Or perhaps it is a broken heart. How we savor a broken heart.''\n``What is it we want?''\n``Only to sup on your mind. Is it a keen mind, or a weak one?'' The claws brushed Sorrille's temples.\n``Perhaps it is a broken mind.''\n``How we savor a broken mind.'' The claws tangled longingly in his hair.\n``What is it we want?''\n``We want to see your eyes, pretty lordling.'' Again the voice was Belisa's. ``Will you not show us your eyes, pretty, pretty lordling?''\nSorrille rolled over, growling at the overly soft royal bed, then grunted with satisfaction at the taste of sweet ale on Belisa's lips. He was about to scold her playfully for cuckolding the king with such wanton frequency when the unnaturally dark lustre of her mouth roused in him the first full-fledged panic of his adult life. He began to thrash about wildly, expecting to feel not one but four pairs of claws groping for his vital organs. Instead, he discovered himself hurling through the amorous Shadowchild's form as if it were no more than a pillar of smoke.\nHe ran without seeing, his arms raised protectively around his head, his feet pounding the plains with such force that it seemed the whole world was a vibrating drumskin. Ground and sky alternately flew apart and then collided, and between them was Sorrille, just barely managing to keep his balance. Fear roiled in his skull like breakers slamming against a cliff, then spilled over and over again into the forgotten lagoon beyond it. He gasped for breath as if he were drowning, or as if there were too little air in the sky. Like the plains-wind itself, he unsettled feeding vultures, alarmed a pair of rutting dogs. And all the while, the Shadowchildren kept pace with him effortlessly, their ghostly feet skimming the ground, their voiced entangling him in a perpetual litany of taunts and threats which tickled the inside of his ears like the echo of his own crazed thoughts.\nFinally, he could endure no more. He turned to face them with the wrath-contorted countenance of a hero scourging the infernal regions, raised his arms prophetically, and cried ``Begone!'' in a tone that fell somewhere between breathlessness and hysteria. As if to humor, one last time, his ill-conceived attempt to elude them, the Shadowchildren shrank back a few yards in mock terror then burst into discordant hilaria and began to approach him once again. Sorrille backed away from them involuntarily, in the measured, almost ritual dance of quarry that knows itself doomed. And then he was falling. And then slipping, with sublime gratitude, into the deepest midnight of unconsciousness.\nSome landscapes are deceptively monochromatic; the eye, drowning in a wash of the one color that begins to seem like no-color, searches frantically for a blazing streak of difference, for some brilliant rebel hue. Instead, it discovers the myriad nuances that reside in even the most economical of palettes. And so a dismally grey landscape, for example, becomes first a welter of possibilities and then an intricate tapestry of shadings and modulations. Steel-grey yields dove's-breast grey and birch grey and the grey of mute dawn and fog-misted lakes. Then synaesthesia sets in, and grey becomes the odor of wood-smoke, the chime of plashing water, a morning wind beaded with dew. The senses unveil themselves to a symphony of grey chords, textures, glimmering motes, and sometimes the Grey Lady who orchestrates it makes her feathery descent and presses a goblet of silver-grey wine to one's lips...\nCoughing violently as the bitter cold stuff made its way down his throat, Sorrille hoisted himself into a sitting position on the thatch-bed of dried balsam beneath him. He studied his surroundings long enough to conclude that he was in some sort of mountain aerie, disconcertingly higher than he had ever been before. After reeling with vertigo for a few moments, he turned his attention to the strange-looking being that had apparently appointed herself his nursemaid. Draped loosely in some iridescent cloth the indefinite color of a cloud, she was tall and supple as a young tree, with an oxymoronic combination of smooth, glowing skin and bone-white hair that made her age impossible to determine. Her onyx-black eyes were so widely spaced that it was difficult to look into both of them simultaneously, and her nose was aquiline in a cruelly graceful way. Altogether, her aspect was unsettlingly predatory.\nSorrille assembled his facial features into an expression of rapt attentiveness tinged with urbane wit. ``Would you find me presumptuous were I to ask you where I am?''\n``Your manners are those of the court,'' she replied, scrutinizing him as if he were a puzzle to be solved. ``This is my dwelling-site. Did you wish to find yourself elsewhere?''\n``On the contrary. I am delighted to find myself here, for I had not expected to survive the night.'' He paused while she tended the small fire near his bed. ``I was fleeing the bane of the Charred Lands---the Shadowchildren. Four of them.''\nHer face registered neither surprise nor fear. ``So I suspected. Only a fool or a hunted man would fail to avoid my wolf-trap. The Children must have lost your scent once you fell. Be glad that they are blind.''\n``Indeed, I am overjoyed. Unfortunately, I lost consciousness while falling into your trap, and am consequently ignorant of what has transpired since that event. Would you be so kind as to share with me any information you may have gleaned on the subject?''\n``A great many circumlocutions,'' she observed, with a trace of what seemed like amusement. Then, as if it were unnecessary to respond to him, she removed some strips of cooking meat from the fire and brought them to him. ``You are no doubt very hungry,'' she said, seeing the flicker of avid interest on his face. ``Then it is wisest not to eat too quickly.''\nFinally, while Sorrille fought to obey her advice, she returned arbitrarily to his unanswered question. ``Some things I will tell you. Others I will not.'' She smiled at him vaguely. ``The more you tell me of yourself, the more I may tell you of myself. But still I will not tell you all.''\nBristling with irritation at her monosyllabic riddling, Sorrille confined himself to inviting her discretion in such matters. She smiled again, a bit less vaguely.\n``I am Naraya. I found you in my wolf-trap last night, cold but safe in the absence of lupine companions. The Children had already scattered, as they would have, in any event, upon my arrival. They do not relish my presence.'' In response to Sorrille's wary, questioning look, she added, ``Calm yourself. If I am not quite the same as you, neither am I unnatural or dangerous.'' She smiled yet again, this time with the obvious intention of reassuring her guest. ``I brought you here,'' she concluded, ``and now I am eager to hear the tale of your adventures. Few men venture this far from Renith city, and you seem poorly equipped for a journey.''\n``I am not travelling of my own accord.'' As the indignity of his situation struck him anew, he clenched a fist till the knuckles whitened, then glanced up with a vehement sullenness to meet Naraya's amused and knowing look. ``But of course you had already guessed as much.''\nShe nodded her assent. ``But what I have guessed or failed to guess is unimportant. Please honor me with the telling of your tale.''\nHe rose from the thatch-bed, paced himself into a more courteous mood, and returned to his place by the fire. ``Very well, lady. I shall disclose all to you, as you have been a most gracious and generous hostess.'' He bowed with curt but sincere gratitude, then sat.\n``I am Sorrille, Duke of Renith, only son of the first of the nine landed families. I was banished yesterday morning at the order of Onri himself. It was an astonishingly merciful punishment for the crime of treason, which the king was most fully aware I had not committed. Were I in fact a traitor to Renith, my head would be gracing a pike at the city gate this very moment. Instead, I have been magnanimously sent off to wander about the wastelands, and hopefully perish in them, while Onri enjoys the talk currently circulating about his wise, just, and seemingly perpetual reign. My real crime, incidentally, was dallying with the queen.''\nSurprise flickered in Naraya's depthless eyes. ``You risked the king's wrath for a few hours' pleasure? Was this royal matron so terribly alluring? Or perhaps she had ensorcelled you?''\n``Belisa is young and fair, and we had been lovers for many months. We were caught when a valet jealous of Belisa's favor spied on us and then brought the king to keep him company at the keyhole. Had things been otherwise, I might be in the lady's arms this very moment, bathed in the gilt sunlight of her person. She is truly glorious.''\n``So I would imagine. How came she to be the wife of an aging monarch? Even I know that Onri has ruled in Renith for many decades.''\n``She was one of the many spoils he returned with from a recent campaign in the Quartz Mountains. She was a princess there; Onri captured her brother along with her. The poor fellow died in the royal dungeons last year, while Belisa lingers on as a pampered prisoner of the palace.''\n``Apparently she has managed to enjoy a few small liberties.'' Naraya curled her pale lips mischievously, then caught Sorrille's slightly annoyed look. ``But forgive me, I have interrupted again. Please continue.''\n``To make a long story short, Belisa loathes Onri, and Onri would fain have his kingdom believe otherwise. He is fond of boasting that he is 'more a man than any young pup in the city,' as evidenced by his youthful queen's passionate devotion to him. At nearly every banquet in the palace, he pretends to grow extravagantly drunk as soon as Belisa retires, then dares any man at the table to try and divert her favor from him. He laughs uproariously and says he'll forfeit his crown to the first who succeeds in doing so. It's not quite senile swaggering, though---more a senile stratagem for luring any potential cuckolders into making less-than-careful moves. Onri wants to know who his rivals in love are before they so much as cast a longing look in Belisa's direction. In my case he found out after the fact, and had me arrested on grounds of treason rather than let anyone discover I'd added a pair of horns to the ornamentation on his crown.''\nNaraya clicked her tongue and chuckled. ``You were fortunate to escape with your life, it seems. What possessed the king to be so lenient?''\n``Belisa's pleading, no doubt. His compromise was to have me die out of sight instead of in a public execution. And his last perverse joke was inviting me to return with a Shadowchild and claim the throne I had 'tried to gain through most depraved and foul subterfuge.' That was the statement he made before his court in the most smug and self-righteous tone he could muster; only I heard the tremor of insane fury in his voice.''\n``And what will you do now? Lay siege to Renith, demanding your lady-love?'' Naraya's voice was gently mocking.\n``Actually, I'm planning to take Onri up on his challenge. He did present it before a score of witnesses, so he can't possibly refuse to honor it. I think Belisa would enjoy being queen of Renith were there a gout-free and virile king at her side. And I'm increasingly taken with the prospect of trying on Onri's crown for size.'' Sorrille grinned as if he were plotting a schoolboy prank.\n``And all you need do is return to Renith with a Shadowchild in tow?'' asked Naraya, pretending amazement.\n``That's correct.''\n``Simply capture a Child and take it along home with you?''\n``Exactly.''\nShe burst into peals of laughter so infectious that before long Sorrille was doubled over, and the echoes of their combined amusement were rippling the chill mountain air.\nSorrille spent the better part of the afternoon exploring Naraya's aerie like a shepherd on some long-awaited holiday. Shortly after feeding him, Naraya had taken Sorrille on a brief tour of its points of interest: a purple-hued hot spring, a rock ledge curtained by the pristine cascade of a waterfall, several giant birches with foliage so dense they obscured the sun wholly. Then she had excused herself to rest and left him to his own devices. After luxuriating in the hot spring, until his body remembered nothing of the last night's bruising fall, he lay naked on the ledge, sunning in the warm bright mist the waterfall so obligingly exuded. Feeling his strength return at last, he shook the dust from his clothes and donned them with arrogant grace. True enough, his dragon's hide boots were quite scuffed, and a few rubies were loose in the hem of his cloak. Still, considering the events of the previous three days, he had done a remarkable job of avoiding dishevelment. Even the puny bone dagger had finally proved of worth; its blade turned out to be ideally suited for scraping the stubble off one's cheek.\nSorrille's feeling of self-satisfaction was somewhat undercut by the fact that he had no idea whatsoever where he was. When he had asked Naraya, over breakfast, to give him a geographical update, she had calmly reiterated that ``there were some things she chose not to tell him,'' and then, as if to reduce his exasperation, added that her aerie ``was where it was.'' So now, having roamed about the place idly for long enough, Sorrille began to inspect it diligently for some clue to his whereabouts.\nThe first conclusion he arrived at, after treading every inch of the aerie twice, was that it was completely devoid of any visible access. Nearly an acre broad, it was bordered on three sides by perilously steep slopes and on the fourth by the mountain's utmost peak. ``How on earth did she bring me here?'' he muttered repeatedly, more out of dumb wonder than out of any real hope that his strange hostess would enlighten him upon her return. Next he devoted himself to identifying whatever he could in the distance, a task rendered nearly impossible by the mountain's obstructive tiara of clouds. Finally, he made out the palace spires of Renith in the south, the foothills of the Quartz Mountains to the west, and the snarled black treetops of the Ashen Forest appallingly near, in the east. His educated hunch was that in the north, behind the towering peak of Naraya's mountain, the Forest proliferated in yet more wild and unsightly abandon; it did, after all, extend out of sight in that general direction.\nWith the directness of a homing pigeon, Sorrille's mind returned over and over again to the problem of how the willowy, less-than-massive Naraya had transported him to her aerie. He weighed more than she did, certainly, especially when unconscious, and there were no trails up the mountainside along which she could have dragged him in a litter or led him on horseback. Not that he'd even seen any horses grazing, or any empty litters lying about. He shook his head in bewilderment, staring absently at Renith all the while, as if it were the source of his confusion. And then it struck him: Renith looked mournfully remote not so much because of the shroud of mountain- mist he was forced to view it through, as because of the fact that it was a good deal further than a day's walk in the distance. Naraya's steel-grey peak was none other than the rock outcrop he had tried so desperately to reach last sunset, transformed from mountain to molehill by some weird trick of the waning light.\n``Who is she, and how did she bring me here?'' he muttered once more, setting off to find the lady and demand that she satisfy his more than idle curiosity. No longer solicitous of her need for rest, he searched the aerie with noisy, impatient movements. He was red-faced and panting by the time he was willing to concede that her present whereabouts were a complete mystery to him. He sighed the terse sigh of a courtier resummoning his dignity, and wondered whether he were any less a captive in this uncharted Shangri-la than he had been in Onri's dungeons.\nHe had consumed a hearty portion of roasted meat strips and was irritably poking the fire into a more respectable form of defense against the chilly starlight when Naraya emerged noiselessly from behind a curtain of night-heavy foliage. The leaves began to rustle in the wake of her silver-clad form like children whispering in stealthy fits and starts; no doubt if she turned to face them, they would lapse again into frozen silence. As she approached Sorrille, the fire blazed in miniature duplicate in the glossy black disks of her eyes; he shuddered, disturbed anew by his inability to encompass her widely-spaced gaze in his own. Smiling, she placed her hands on either side of his face and bent down to kiss him, rousing in him a dizzying mixture of primal terror and unmistakable desire. He felt weightless yet lethargic, too sleepy to resist her will as it enveloped him like the burning glow of a naked sun. He was perfectly aware he was being enchanted, as he had not been when the Shadowchild laid similarly caressing hands on him not so long ago. And yet, beneath his indignance at Naraya's audacity lay a strangely calm acceptance of it and even amused curiosity about what she would do next.\n``I have not had so pleasing a guest as you in some time,'' she said, stepping back a few paces to study him. Vines of honey-red firelight crept through her white hair again and again, till it seemed she was wearing one of the golden hairnets currently fashionable among the ladies of Renith court.\n``And is witchery a customary feature of your hospitality?'' inquired Sorrille with a laugh, as he blinked himself alert.\n``I was not aware that it was. Do I seem to require such stratagems?'' She regarded him with an injured expression and stiffened slightly.\n``I meant no offense, lady, but your kiss tasted so unlike any I have known before that I could only explain it in terms of magic.''\n``Kisses are among those things that be which require no explanation.'' Apparently Sorrille had soothed her ruffled feathers somewhat; she had resumed her proud, willowy stance, and a look faintly recognizable as coyness flickered across her unsettling features. ``Do I seem to require stratagems?'' she repeated, with eerie self-assurance, and began to unlace the bodice of her pearlescent gown. Topaz points of firelight glinted in the fabric as it slid back from her shoulders slowly, slowly, and then dropped into a silver pool at her ankles, revealing the most spendid female form Sorrille had ever been privileged to behold. A sculptor, Sorrille thought in amazement, would kill for the opportunity to immortalize it in marble or alabaster, and Naraya's flesh, with its unearthly pallor and flawless luster, did resemble the rarest and most costly specimen of either stone. Moreover, her ample but firmly-molded curves were nothing if not statuesque, though her long limbs and the rhythmic sweep to her walk suggested a sensuality not much inclined toward standing still. Accustomed to the initial modesty and restraint of Renith's noble women, Sorrille could not repress the chord of awe-tinged uneasiness her aura of untrammeled wildness struck deep within him.\n``I take it you plan to seduce me,'' he said, in an effort to stall her, to reverse the weights between them so that he had the advantage. But she did not answer, did not even smile at him in the pertly roguish manner Belisa tended to employ when she knew she was doing something shockingly out of character. Before he had the chance to contemplate fully the striking contrasts between the two women, deft strong fingers were whispering over his chest, unclasping his cloak, his belt, unlacing his tunic, coaxing his blood to roar in his temples. For a moment, he thought he heard Naraya's voice in his ear, soothing and insistent, telling him to ``forget Belisa'' with each husky exhaled breath. The next he knew, her lips were on his and, wrapped in naught but the cool night air and her limbs, he was spinning endlessly through a skyful of bizarre and vivid dreams. The first involved being dragged aloft to go crashing through a smothering run of treetops with the headlong momentum of a plains-wind. Then a net of gilded foliage was whirling into a blurry cyclone, bursting apart, hurling Naraya and him at the stars, where they swooped in soaring arcs from constellation to constellation. The spheres embroidered music about them, dazzling improvisations woven of twanging crystalline threads and liquid silver notes. He tried to see Naraya's face but couldn't; they were tumbling too rapidly from the precipice they had been poised upon the instant before. They swung into an upward curve, cast their shadows on the moon, plummeted down and down and down until they were skimming the pewter-and-black silk surface of a lake. Then they were rising in whimsical curlicues, like a tongue of breeze lapping up air, when a low-hanging cloud suddenly wrapped them in its gauzy cloak of ether, its plumes of sleep-inducing smoke...\nThen it was pearl-pink early dawn and Naraya was gently prodding him awake...\nSorrille made a drowsy mental note of the fact that he was sprawled naked on some sort of crop-furred hide blanket, and that Naraya, who was fully attired and groomed, looked a great deal more dignified than he. He was fumbling on his clothing with as much haste as he could muster, planning to ask, when he was properly dressed, about her curious predilection for being up and about in the wee hours of the morning. He was about to address her with an expression of wry amusement when she focused her anything-but-crossed eyes on him and smiled in a disconcertingly self-assured, even patronizing way.\n``I am more than a little interested,'' she announced, ``in enjoying nights such as the last again.''\n``Indeed,'' he replied, feeling oddly piqued, ``you seem pleased with what transpired. By the way, what did transpire? Did you, perhaps, strew some vision-provoking powder on the fire while my attention was fixed elsewhere? You could not have tampered with my food or drink, since I had prepared it myself and finished it before you appeared.''\nShe tossed back her granite-colored mane and laughed with abandon for several moments. Then she fell abruptly silent and regarded Sorrille with a sober look that revealed nothing of what she was thinking or feeling. ``Some things I will tell you. Others I will not.'' She briefly tended the fire she had started while he was sleeping, then picked up where she had left off when he so cavalierly interrupted her. Even the patronizing smile was back in place. ``I enjoyed last night and am quite anxious for you to prolong your stay with me. But no doubt you will require more of an incentive to remain than a simpler reminder of my charms can provide. After all, your memories of this queen Belisa''---she mispronounced the name in what seemed a calculated fashion---``are bound to distract you sooner or later, and I will have none but an attentive lover.''\nSorrille snorted haughtily at her boldness. ``I pay attention only to that which I find myself interested in.''\n``I am sure of it. That is why I have conceived of a proposition I think you will find most fascinating.''\n``Indeed? Do then, by all means, propose it.''\n``Agree to be my guest for six more nights, and at the end of that time I will assist you in snaring a Shadowchild. Then I will see to it that you are properly provisioned for a triumphant return to Renith.''\nSorrille remained silent for several minutes, torn between the desire to laugh aloud and the sinking feeling that Naraya was perfectly in earnest, no matter how mad her proposal sounded. Then he remembered what she had said about the Children fleeing her approach, like timid birds or squirrels, and decided he would encourage her to elaborate on her invitation. After all, he had nothing to lose, and she might unwittingly reveal useful information to him. Furthermore, he hadn't really resolved the problem of where he would go next, and even were he to descend safely the near-perpendicular slopes of Naraya's mountain, he would find himself in constant mortal peril on the ground below. Accepting the assistance of an expert regional guide was clearly the wisest thing he could do, even if that guide had both albino tresses and lusty designs on his person.\n``I'd be delighted to extend my visit here. But perhaps, before I change my travel plans, you ought to tell me more about the rewards that my staying on would assure me of. I do not like to enter contractual arrangements half-informed, and what you are proposing is akin to such an arrangement, is it not?''\n``Indeed. I remark upon your judiciousness.'' She smiled drily as he nodded his acknowledgment of the compliment. ``If you will continue to be my guest, for the number of nights I have already specified, I will procure for you a substance which renders the Shadowchildren docile. Then I will help you to administer this substance, and, finally, you will be free to return to Renith and unseat its monarch and your rival in love.''\n``Most intriguing. And just how is it that this substance affects the Children as you say it does?''\n``The Children are ghouls at present, indeed. But once they were human. This substance, the exract of a plant named mnisse, wakes a Child's memory of the human state. In its grip, Children pass quickly through self-horror to a boundless gratitude towards that saviour who has raised them from evil. Like once-wild dogs, they lick joyously the hand which breaks their will.''\n``This mnisse sounds formidable. Why haven't you simply used it to encourage the Children to relocate---in Renith, say?''\n``The effect of the mnisse is but temporary.''\n``Ah.'' Sorrille shuddered to think what might befall him should the stuff prove more temporary than anticipated.\n``And I am quite happy with the Charred Lands as they are. The Shadowchildren have kept my mountain free of intruders, though I doubt it would give them pleasure to know they had been of service to me. It is well for me that I alone know where to find the mnisse.''\n``And also that the Children know you have the means to control them. That's why they run when they see you coming.''\n``You are correct. With the help of the mnisse, I brought unpleasant fates to a score of them, in order to warn their fellows against disturbing me. It was a successful ploy.''\nMuch to his own surprise, Sorrille found himself believing her, even subtly inclining toward enthusiasm for the project she had outlined. ``I don't suppose,'' he said at last, ``that the length of my stay here is negotiable?''\nNaraya laughed at him. ``Such impatience in a would-be monarch. Onri has devoted a lifetime to Renith's glory, while you, my comely upstart, begrudge it a mere handful of nights.''\nMore than a handful, thought Sorrille.\nThe following six days were uneventful in the usual sense of that word; Sorrille came before long to anticipate Naraya's comings and goings, and even to enjoy without undue mistrust her disorienting midnight visits. For not only did he survive each rendezvous intact, but he also began to develop a taste for what he consistently perceived as airborne sexual acrobatics. He was faintly disturbed by the fact that Naraya was so mysteriously nocturnal a creature; she seemed continually to vanish while he slept and then again for the bulk of the daylight hours. He spent those hours in solitary idling, alternately wondering where it was she went and how it was she got there, and imagining what it would be like to be Renith's king and Belisa's rightful lover. Even while he soared from pinnacle to pinnacle of ecstasy with Naraya, he remained residually conscious that his passion for Belisa had in no measure abated. And, strangely enough, he had the impression that Naraya was perfectly aware of his feelings and yet completely unperturbed by them. She was a fascinating being, but somehow a faintly revolting one as well. He looked forward with no little eagerness to the end of his sojourn with her.\nShe approached him on the sixth evening not with glittering magic and seduction in her eyes, but with a vial of crimson liquid. Sorrille, completing his day's-end repast by the fire, sprung to his feet so hastily that his wine goblet was upended.\n``Yes,'' she said, anticipating his query, ``this is the mnisse. Have done with your meal and we will pay a call to the Ashen Forest.''\n``Never mind the meal. Why keep the Children waiting?'' He dabbed the corners of his mouth with a deplorably grease-stained silken handkerchief, then crumpled it into a ball and tossed it in the fire. ``Is anything but that vial necessary? Weapons? A torch? And just how will we be travelling?''\n``The vial is all we require. Weapons are useless against the Children, and I have excellent night vision.'' It was just as well that she left his last question unanswered, for what he witnessed next stunned him so utterly he ceased listening for a reply.\nTo begin with, Naraya appeared to be encased in some kind of transparent cloud, more palpable than visible, which distorted her features without obscuring them, like some clear, vibrant haze of summer heat. And so, although he could see what was happening to her, moment by moment, he could never be quite sure he was perceiving it correctly. First her hair began to change subtly, from a tousled mane of gauzy filaments to something reminiscent of frozen fountain spray, and then like a wiry, fanned branch of the fabled white palm. As it slowly compressed itself into a crest-like formation neatly dividing one half of her skull from the other, her arms began to gravitate downward in their sockets until they were two stiff, prong-ended affairs protruding from the middle of her chest, which was no longer a voluptuous, sheer fabric-sheathed marvel, but a single smooth arc of snow-silver breast feathers. Next, the train of her gown lengthened into a glorious fan of tail-plumage, spangled not with sequins but with white-on-ebony markings. And as her whole body began to tilt forward, balancing on its new center, Sorrille realized with a start that, with a few seemingly minor exceptions, her face was clearly recognizable as the one he had been regarding just moments earlier. He thought dazedly to himself that, if she was rather peculiar-looking as a woman, she was incomparable as a bird.\n``Well? Shall we be on our way?'' Her voice, with its typically mocking quality, was relatively unchanged, though it was disconcertingly difficult to locate its present source. Her mica-black beak, opened slightly but immobile, offered no clue as it refracted the pallid moonlight.\nSorrille nodded, still inarticulate, and she hoisted herself aloft with a trio of wing-flaps so powerful he had to struggle to remain on his feet. When she sunk her claws into his cloak-collar, it was all he could do to keep from screaming like a madman.\n``Sleep,'' she told him, ``for the altitude may cause you some discomfort, and you must be in sound condition when we descend.'' But he had lapsed already into the utter oblivion of the terrified, and was floating there impervious both to her magic and to her everlastingly mocking smile.\nSorrille had long been immersed in a most bizarre dream about a series of well-choreographed swordfights with the wind, in which clusters of stars assembled themselves into shields now and again, when Naraya, in her human form, woke and then helped him to his feet. She was wearing the cloud-colored gown once again, and her hair was in the impressively snarled state Sorrille had grown used to in the past week.\nAwake now, the memory of her metamorphosis staggered him anew, like some phantom foe come to resume the battle after granting him his paltry respite. ``Who and what are you, Lady?''\n``Is it not all but obvious that I am bird as well as woman? And we have not come to discuss the essence of my nature, but to conduct our business with the shadow ghouls of Ashen Forest.''\n``Very well. Lead the way. And by the way, I'm almost glad you nearly turned me into a gibbering fool back there---having done my overreacting for the evening, I find the prospect of confronting Shadowchildren to be positively exhilarating.''\nNaraya smiled briefly, then led him a few yards towards a brook of jet-black water which glittered dully in the moonlight. She gave him a cautionary look. ``Mirkwater,'' she said, confirming his suspicions, ``poisonous as well as fatal to the touch. Keep a safe distance from it, though we will be following the banks of this brook.'' Sorrille cocked an eyebrow in reply, then hastened into step behind the swift if stealthy Naraya.\nThe Ashen Forest was every bit as unsettling as he had imagined it would be. Only along the brook did the foliage thin enough to reveal even a tattered black ribbon of sky, and the air, already oppressively thick with darkness, was suffused here and there with a clammy noxious mist. The muddy brook-banks oozed mist as well, though not enough to obscure wholly the occasional snake-tangle disengaging itself for a swim in the unreflecting water. And yet, notwithstanding, there was a strange beauty to the place as well. The ivory bulbs he knew to be bone-fruit hung in phosphorescent clusters above him, their symmetry and pallor like that of priceless sculpture. Snowberries glittered in the crevices between rocks like fistfuls of mercury droplets, and the tree-trunks, which burgeoned above into medusan gnarls of ebony branches and black-crystal top-leaves, were iced below with a kind of silver glaze. The thought crossed his mind that perhaps the bosom of the Forest yielded beings such as Naraya in addition to its loathsome Children.\nNaraya signalled for him to stop behind her, finally, at a particularly sinuous curve in the brook. She pointed to the gutted corpses of some dozen Forest animals and informed Sorrille that there were Shadowchildren near.\n``I'm afraid I fail to see the connection.''\n``Unlike other scavengers, the Children hoard dead flesh until there is an abundance of it to dine upon. With all of eternity stretched before them, there is no reason to devour meager sustenance in a haphazard way. What you see here are the remains of a recent feast.''\n``The Children are scavengers?'' asked Sorrille, the hair rising along his neck.\nThe look in Naraya's eyes told him that she was laughing uproariously in silence. ``You did not know? Yes, the Children are an especially nasty kind of vulture; they delight in creating carrion as much as they do in eating it.''\n``Thank the gods for your wolf trap. And for your succour, lady.''\n``Ah, yes, gratitude. But we have other business to concern us now.'' She extracted the vial of mnisse from a fold in her gown; its vivid ruby hue disturbed the darkness like a tiny but brilliant lantern. ``You must bend over the mirkwater as if you were going to drink; the simple probability that death is imminent will lure our friends closer. Then you must cry out in mimicry of a death throe. As you fall, unstopper the vial and splatter yourself with its contents; the Children will arrive in moments to lap them up greedily. I will be watching from the shadows beyond the curve in the brook, and shall join you at the appropriate moment.''\n``How thoughtful of nature to make mnisse the color of blood,'' quipped Sorrille.\n``The mnisse is not red; the blood I stirred it into, however, is.'' Naraya's eyes glinted with lavish amusement at Sorrille's ignorance. ``Enough talk. Here is the vial. Do not spill it needlessly; I travelled quite far to harvest its crucial ingredient.'' And with this final jibe she moved into the shadows ahead, obscuring herself so well that Sorrille soon had no idea where she was.\nSorrille began to perform the charade with a feeling of witty self-satisfaction he would never have expected to experience in such circumstances. As he knelt by the brook, its aura of evil intensified perceptibly, and he wondered what kind of dolt would insist on drinking water that as much as declared itself poisonous. But he forced himself to bring his face to within inches of the sluggish surface, even panting a little for the sake of verisimilitude. Then he fell back on one hand and issued a lengthy croak of pseudo-agony. Unable to restrain a grimace while dousing throat and chest with the mnisse-laced blood, he was careful to conceal the vial before he sank and stiffened in a rendition of rigor mortis so subtle he was proud of it. It wasn't until he heard the Children's gossamer wings rustling behind him that he felt unmanageable trepidation and even prayed to the gods that the lady wasn't playing him for a fool.\n``Dessert,'' said one, in an utterly timbreless voice which managed to convey somehow the creature's unsavory sense of humor. It ran its dessicate trio of fingers along Sorrille's form in a way that made him want to scream for Naraya.\n``And what a very large dessert,'' rejoined a second, contributing its manual appendages to the less-than-soothing massage effort. Sorrille squeezed his eyes shut involuntarily. When the third pair of claws began to stroke him, he fantasized, briefly and horribly, that he was buried underground and the roots of plants were groping their way past him.\nThen, at last, after Sorrille found his capacity for shallow breathing diminishing with alarming speed, the three Children began to sniff and nibble tentatively at his bloodsoaked tunic. Hissing with dismay when they discovered it was not flesh they were tasting, they hastened to rend the fabric and expose the real delicacy beneath. Sorrille had all but given himself up for lost when, in a abrupt and unified motion, they recoiled from their ``dessert'' with a chorus of despairing little shrieks.\nStill half-dazed, Sorrille rose to his feet just in time to behold what was without contest the most hideous sight of his life. The Shadowchildren, wailing in concert like three of the four winds, were thrashing about violently, slamming their wings into boulders and clawing at their branch-like tresses in what was apparently the ghoulish equivalent of tearing out one's hair Though he was beginning to grow concerned by Naraya's failure to appear, he was relieved, at least, to learn that the mnisse lived up to her description of it. He had started to move cautiously in the direction of her purported hiding-place when he found himself besieged by three unspeakably contrite monsters. One hung timidly on his sleeve, a second patted his chest ingratiatingly, and the third rolled eyes as mournful as a hounddog's at him. He had the distinct impression they were preparing to address him with some sort of abject plea on their part for mercy and loving kindness on his.\n``No,'' he mumbled, ``this is more than I can endure.'' He allowed himself one convulsive shudder, then, with the wrath- contorted countenance of a hero scourging the infernal regions, he raised his arms prophetically and roared ``Begone!'' And, for the first time in Renithian history, Shadowchildren scattered in terror at the sound of a human voice.\n``Wait!'' he added hoarsely, appalled at his own stupidity. The slowest of the three paused in the shadow it was in the midst of vanishing into, one of its badly dented wings twitching uncertainly in the murky light. ``I have need of you,'' he continued, controlling the hysteria in his voice. The Child advanced as if afraid he would change his mind, then halted a few feet before him and hovered on ghostly feet.\n``I see the two of you are fast becoming friends,'' said Naraya, after executing yet another of her out-of-thin air grand entrances.\nSorrille turned on her. ``Where in the name of the bird-gods have you been?''\n``Did I not make clear that I would return at the appropriate moment? It seems as though all has proceeded according to plan.''\n``A matter of perspective, I suppose. What on earth is that?'' He pointed to the strange-looking beast she had tethered to her wrist.\n``This,'' she replied, moving it closer for him to inspect, ``is how you will be journeying home. I cannot transport you and the Child together.'' The Child whimpered at the mention of its name, while Sorrille whistled at what he saw. Smaller than a steed but larger than a donkey, its head and legs were covered with greyish-white fur, while its internal organs were plainly visible through the transparent hide of its midsection. Naraya had caparisoned it with tasselled reins and a makeshift blanket and saddlebag.\n``What is it known as?''\n``It is a Forest deer, unprepossessing in appearance but gentle of temperament and swift for its size---it will easily keep pace with the Shadowchild's flight, especially in light of the battered state of these wings.'' She clucked her tongue at the object of her criticism, who drooped its head in response, in a horrible travesty of shamefacedness.\n``I should create quite a sensation in Renith, considering the company I'll be arriving in. What a shame I'll be doing so in such bedraggled attire.'' He looked regretfully at the blood- stained rents in his clothing.\n``You won't be,'' Naraya informed him, extracting from the saddlebag a tunic and cloak of the same chameleonic silver fabric as her gown. She handed them to him. ``Did I not say that you would be properly provisioned? There are winesacks and food in the bag as well, and here, finally, is a supply of mnisse more than adequate to your purposes.''\nHe took the pouch she held outstretched. ``Unmixed with blood this time, I see.''\n``The Child will accept additional doses of mnisse quite eagerly in its present state. But you must be sure to feed it those doses nightly, and expel it from your city well before your supply runs out.''\n``Fear not. I'll send it on its way the first chance I get.''\n``And now that you are in hands capable as my own,'' she concluded with a smile, ``I will bid you adieu.'' And with a ritual flourish, she began to transform herself once again into a creature of the sky.\n``My thanks, lady.'' Sorrille could feel his words unravelling, letter by letter, inside the cocoon of luminous air she had wrapped herself within. He swung onto the back of his galloping anatomy lesson and instructed the Child to lead him to a southbound route out of the Forest as quickly as it damn well could.\nThe return trip to Renith, which took nearly three days, was rendered exceptionally crisis-free by Naraya's abundant forethought. The deer she had rounded up was a quick and sturdy little mount, and the store of food and wine she had stashed in its saddlebag seemed virtually inexhaustible. Most importantly, the nightly pinch of mnisse she had recommended Sorrille give the Shadowchild made it a surprisingly indispensable travelling companion, possessed of a flawless sense of direction and protective instincts that would put a mother slinkah to shame. While they were still in the Forest, it regularly shooed snarling skeleton-wolves and overly-inquisitive snake-tangles, and even, on one occasion, discouraged a roving band of its own species from approaching. Then, on the plains, it circled down from its aerial guidepost whenever a cloud of the bulbous flies that had annoyed Sorrille so on his outbound journey required dispersing, and arranged its wings, by night, in an effective shelter from the wind. Sorrille never quite got over his distaste for physical proximity to the Child, and he certainly never adjusted to the way it telepathically second-guessed him. But he was relieved to find that the mnisse had apparently ruined his macabre squire's appetite for flesh, cooked or otherwise; through the whole of their trek, he never witnessed the Child consume anything but the plains-clover he himself had found so thoroughly unsatisfactory as a means of sustenance.\nWhen the city gates came into view just after sunset on the third day, he donned the cloak and tunic Naraya had given him and soon discovered with pleasure that he could feel as well as see the intricate lightplay in its fabric, rippling over his torso like a mosaic of liquid silver. Assuming a pose of elegant hauteur, he mentally commanded the Shadowchild to walk slightly behind him on his left---the traditional position of voluntary deference---and exultantly advanced until he was standing opposite the peepdoor. He pummelled it with the tiny but solid hilt of his dagger and waited for the startled response from within; Renithian sheep and cowherds were superstitiously careful about requesting readmittance to the city well before the sun began even to hang low in the sky. Surely enough, the gateguard flung the peepdoor open and peered through cautiously, his view limited, fortunately, to Sorrille's face, which, unfortunately, was suspiciously cleanshaven.\n``Yer mightly dapper-lookin' for a herdsman,'' the guard said slowly, studying Sorrille's eyes for evidence of intent to, perhaps, perpetrate espionage or commit an assassination. Sorrille quickly scanned his aural memories for a lower class voice he could do a passable imitation of, and fixed upon that of the stableboy who had taunted him the day of his banishment.\n``Juice because oi takes some proide in me looks is no reason to keeps me and the anymals out 'ere in mortal dainger. Ain't it bad enough that oim late from chasin' a contrary-loike sheep what run away hairs ago?''\nLuckily the ruse worked before the guard asked Sorrille to stand back for a full-length inspection, or before he wondered why the returning shepherd's ``anymals'' were so uniformly silent. Sorrille heaved a sigh of relief and straightened proudly as the guard shut the peepdoor and began to drag the huge half-gate groaningly open. When at last he emerged from behind it, wheezing and panting, Sorrille hesitated just long enough for shock to register on the man's face before nudging the Forest deer into a dainty canter onto Renithian soil. Soon a handful of guards, with equally shocked expressions, stood aghast and silent in a circle around him, clutching their spears, maces, and unsheathed swords like so many dismayed infants grasping rattles.\n``Gentlemen, gentlemen,'' said Sorrille, ``it's most kind of you to all want to escort me into Onri's presence. However, a two-guard retinue is really quite sufficient.''\n``It's Lord Sorrille, ain't it?'' stammered the nasal-voiced guard who had found the circumstances of Sorrille's banishment so entertaining. He scratched under his helmet meditatively. ``By gawm, milord. Are ye returned from the dead?''\n``No, my old friend. Merely back to claim myself a crown. And that is something, I think, that I would fain have you behold. Come, now, mind my left flank, as you did once before. And you,'' he commanded a mere boy of a guard, ``mind my right.''\nDespite the fact that a lord sent off to certain death rarely came home astride a see-through quadruped, attended by two trembling king's-guards and a bonafide Shadowchild, Sorrille's triumphant procession toward the palace was a curiously lonesome affair. True, the shopkeepers and laborers typically withdrew for their dinners this time of day, and it was too early for the bawds and roistabouts to have begun prowling the streets. But it was odd not to see a single peddler, or street urchin, or stout huswife pursuing her fugitive chickens. Even the few milling figures Sorrille had noticed upon his entry were nowhere to be seen, and the curtains of nearly every window were tightly drawn, though there was still precious daylight to be had. Plus the streets were preternaturally quiet---no wafts of quarrels or laughter, nothing save the occasional whimper of a dog presumably being forced to hold its tongue. Sorrille had the distinct impression that Lower Renith was collectively holding its breath, and that the residents of every household were taking turns peeping out at him once his back was safely to them.\nEnraged, finally, by the cowardice of those who had, less than two weeks earlier, found brazen insults so very easy to hurl about, he reined the deer to a halt and addressed his invisible audience. ``Mark my features well, good city-folk, so that you will recognize me when Renith's crown sits atop my head!'' He paused just long enough for the echo of his words to subside, then coaxed his mount to resume its forward motion.\n``Onri is king! Onri is king!'' a feeble, indignant voice sputtered from behind him. He turned to see the decrepit fool who had used his shin for a cricket ball, wielding a walking-stick angrily in the air and preparing to foray off the doorstep to harass Sorrille yet again. Sorrille silently instructed the Shadowchild to cast a brief look in the daft old goat's direction, which had the desired effect of sending him scampering indoors for cover. Sorrille threw back his head and laughed, and the procession continued to the nearby sound of several audibly suppressed gasps.\nWhen the carnelian walls and golden spires of Renith Palace rose before him at last, Sorrille dismounted and handed his tiny steed's reins to a stunned-looking guard who had just risen unsteadily to his feet. The guard's drinking-and-dicing companions remained seated, openmouthed and seemingly paralyzed, on the steps to the palace's huge crystal-and-filigree door.\n``It's bad enough your disportment adds a rather unaesthestic aspect to the palace facade.'' Sorrille's tone of voice struck a duke-like balance between lighthearted mockery and the implicit threat of violence. ``Don't compound the problem by forcing me to climb over you.''\nThey scrambled off the steps like petitioners who have misguidedly approached the king in one of his fouler moods. Sorrille caught one by the elbow and inquired as to Onri's whereabouts. The guard, despite his valiant effort not to stare with obvious horror at the Shadowchild, seemed to address his very reply to it.\n``His Majesty dines at this hour, milord.''\n``But of course he does, and I'm tactlessly late for the feast. Do lead the way to the banquet-hall, if you would, and announce that Duke Sorrille is come to table.''\nToo flustered to say more, the fellow pulled the palace door ajar and proceeded to carry out Sorrille's instructions. As they marched through the tangle of narrow, poorly-lit corridors, Sorrille was amused to see the palace servants scattering before him as timidly as the city-folk had. Even the guards posted at every fourth turning seemed to be resisting the impulse to turn tail and run. So on and on they went, on their unobstructed way, filling the quasi-evacuated labyrinth with the percussive echos of four pairs of booted feet, the gentle whooshing sounds of a pair of large, semi-contracted wings, and an almost audibly intense sequence of regicidal fantasies.\nSorrille let the palace guard precede him into the banquet- hall and nervously inform the general public there that he had arrived, along with what appeared to be a Shadowchild. Then he had the two gate guards go in and situate themselves on either side of the door, at which point he and his eyebrow-raising sidekick were ready to make their grand entrance. He observed with pique that virtually none of the customs of the dinner table had changed, despite the conspicuous emptiness of his place at it: A dazzling profusion of colorful platters spread the length of the table; jewelled goblets overflowed with wine; servingmen wound their way in and out between the exquisitely costumed dancers; the air, scented with sandalwood, was vibrant with the intermingled sounds of witty repartee and ribald minstrelsy; and Onri's guests were uniformly oblivious to the world outside the banquet-hall. Indeed, they paid scarcely any attention to the palace guard's introduction---after all, what was one person more or less at table?\nOnly Onri seemed to have gathered that there was something noteworthy at the door, and was about to take a good look at it when his queen, attended by no less than six ladies, emerged from a side door to claim her seat beside him. For the next several moments, both Sorrille and Onri stood motionless as men for whom time has stopped, wholly ignoring the gustatory feast upon the table as they gorged themselves visually on that of Belisa's beauty. The gold-embroidered chiffon of Belisa's sleeve caught the light like a butterfly's wing and then spilt down her upraised arm in fold after liquid fold as she pressed self-conscious fingers to her lacquered red tresses, wondering why she had the sense that she was being stared at even more insatiably than usual. As she inclined her chiselled profile in Sorrille's direction, sensing that the especially passionate eyebeams were emanating from thence, she issued a trio of musical little gasps---one of surprised pleasure at Sorrille's appearance, one of ladylike revulsion at the Shadowchild's grotesque visage, and one of utter terror as Onri noticed Sorrille and began to rise from his chair with an ominous lack of haste.\nThe banquet-hall fell completely silent for the first time in decades as the nobles of Renith looked up to see their monarch on the brink of a wholly unpredictable confrontation. Sorrille, who everyone knew had died an unspeakably horrid death, had somehow come back with not only his notoriously short temper but also with an unspeakably horrid monster for backup. His agespotted face white with anger, Onri straightened his fur-trimmed robe on still-powerful shoulders and placed his massive gold crown on his wisp-haired head (he disliked wearing it while he ate since it tended to make his bald spot worse).\n``Why have you returned, you treasonous cur... you base scoundrel... you verminous--?''\n``Allow me to interrupt and you shall have your answer, old man.'' Belisa took this opening exchange of pleasantries as a cue to make herself as invisible as possible. She sat huddled in her chair, head tilted forward so that quantities of hair obscured her face on either side.\n``You dare address me without an honorific, you pompous dandy... you ill-mannered whippersnapper... you foul-mouthed--?''\n``Enough! An impotent old fool who cannot secure the love of his bride and who sends those who are capable of doing so into the wilds to die is in no way deserving of honorifics! But lo! I am not dead, and having survived what I have survived, I no longer find myself cowed in any way by a senile foot-stamping monarch.''\n``He has spoken treason! Seize the traitor!'' Onri's face was purple now, and his agitated gesturings had all but knocked his crown from his head. His uncontrolled rage was so novel a spectacle that dinner guests, servants, and guards alike were watching him as raptly as they might the lead actor in a scandalous play. ``I have commanded you! Seize him!''\n``Silence, Onri! I have not returned to listen to your ranting drool, but to claim the throne and the queen that are rightfully mine. I have met your challenge, and you have no choice but to forfeit both to me!''\n``Challenge? What challenge might that be?'' inquired Onri with a dangerously innocent tone, daring those at the table to supply a single pertinent detail.\n``The challenge, Sire!'' interjected Tirem, the rosy-faced juniormost member of the court. ``Surely you remember---you had your scribe set it down on vellum, just a little under two weeks ago. Then your herald read it aloud the morning Sorrille there was banished, remember? To the crowd that had gathered in front of the palace.'' Tirem babbled on blithely, so glad to be of some use that he failed to interpret correctly Onri's ferociously indrawn breath. ``You know, Sire, the challenge about how anyone who managed to get hold of a Shadowchild like the one Sorrille there's got was entitled---''\n``--to Renith's twin glories---its mighty throne and its jewel-lovely queen. Thank you, Tirem, I couldn't have refreshed His Highness' memory better myself.'' Sorrille strode impatiently toward Onri, who had fallen back into his chair, sputtering soundlessly, his face contorting with hatred as he regarded Sorrille. ``Will you honor your promise, Onri?'' He hovered over the seated king like the most determined of inquisitioners, willing to wait till eternity for the appropriate reply.\n``But of course I will,'' began Onri calmly, with rekindled deviousness, ``the instant you return here with a true denizen of the Ashen Forest, not some inept sorcerer's slapdash concoction! And until you do, I will regard you as a traitor!'' Onri sprung to his feet, more or less, his fury having reached a fresh peak of intolerability.\nSorrille pointed to the Shadowchild, who stood near the doorway twitching its wings as if insulted that its credibility had been called into question. ``Do any of you at this table harbor any doubts as to the creature's identity?''\n``Don't know its name or anything, but it looks like a Child to me!'' ventured Tirem.\n``Of course it is a Shadowchild,'' said bewigged Lord Gauntti, clearing his throat after this pronouncement.\nStout, jovial Roddain moved cautiously toward the door for a closer look. ``Ah'd agree with the both of ye. Now it's true Ah've never been to the thing's stompin' grounds, and so--''\n``There is no way you can possibly verify Sorrille's claim regarding it!'' burst in a triumphant Onri, leaving Roddain puzzling over whether that were what he'd meant to say. ``None of us knows with any certainty what a Shadowchild looks like because any man that has encountered one hasn't lived to tell the tale! All we know about the creature is hearsay and rumor, and a common thread to every bit of Child-lore is that they are impossible to escape, much less to overcome or tame! Obviously, then, what we have here is some manner of impostor---some barbarian Sorrille has induced to stand before us in his ritual dress, complete with a headdress of branches and black face-paint---''\n``Sorry to disappoint you, Onri.'' Sorrille nodded to the Shadowchild, telepathically requesting it to demonstrate its clearly supernatural ability to fly. It had risen but a few inches in the air when Onri backed away from the table, suddenly unsheathing and then brandishing his sword like a wild man.\n``Then it is indeed the forbidden work of some accursed sorcerer! It is fiendish magic and I will not suffer its presence in my palace!''\nBefore Sorrille could warn him otherwise, Onri had lurched forward to attack the Child. Sorrille tried to command it to do nothing but evade Onri's swordthrusts, but apparently its protective instincts were self-inclusive. It curled back its black satin lips, baring the elongated teeth within, and, angrily beating the air with its wings, struck Onri's sword from his hands with a swiftly downhooking claw. As Onri inspected with speechless horror the bloody furrows which now ran the length of his forearm, the Child gave vent to a gale-force battle cry and swung the blackened bronze of its claw again, this time at Onri's head. Onri staggered sideways as if drunken, clutching a hand to his face and bellowing in pain. When he removed the hand and held its crimson palm before him blindly, it became clear that one of his eyes had been maimed. Belisa, with an unladylike squawk, made her presence felt once more and, the minstrels and dancers having wisely scattered already, the dinner guests to either side of her began to stir uneasily, as if preparing to escape themselves.\nSorrille groaned. Much as he despised Onri, becoming an accomplice to regicide at this moment would certainly not help legitimize his claim to the throne. Somehow, he had to restrain the Shadowchild's undeniably murderous behavior, and then go and comfort his lovely distraught Belisa. As he moved toward the wrangling pair, he extracted his mnisse pouch and wondered whether he could distract the Child long enough to administer the stuff. He dangled the pouch before him hopefully, inwardly suspecting it was hopeless. Then, before he could properly register what was taking plce, the Child, its hair a lurid snarl of snaky lightning, was ascending toward the lofty ceiling vaults like someone's nightmare vision of a bird of prey, with an alternately raving and whimpering Onri hooked securely in its talons.\n``Stop!'' cried Sorrille. ``Stop, I command you!'' But the Child was looping and circling in the dark central dome with the impossible agility of a bat, whooping and cawing in harsh depthless tones that were natural neither to human beings nor to creatures of the air. Finally, with a last hissing cry, it flung Onri to his death below and continued its airborne figure-eights with increasingly frenzied speed, in an ecstasy of bloodlust.\n``By the gods,'' Sorrille despaired with silent ferocity, ``that thing is completely out of control! How am I to feed it its last doses of mnisse, or persuade it to fly away home like a good ghoul, for that matter? And it's no doubt just a matter of time before it decides it's days overdue for its carcass imperiale a la Renith!'' For the king of Renith lay, crownless and mangled, lengthwise on the dinner table in the midst of some half-dozen platters of sweetbreads and candied meat, surrounded by his former subjects, all of whom had risen in his presence but none of whom seemed able to remove themselves from it. Someone was missing from the table, though---Sorrille tried to rack his addled brain for who it was when he noticed Belisa, pale and unconscious, gracefully draped on the floor alongside the table. He bolted toward her, temporarily forgetting every other alarming circumstance confronting him, and after a fervent series of ministrations, he managed to rouse her, weak and smiling, to her feet.\n``That was silly of me, Sori, I know. But you returning unharmed, and that thing up there, and Onri all blood-covered--''\n``Hardly standard dinner entertainment. Fret not, even I reeled a bit on my feet, Belisa. Here, sit down.'' He helped her into a chair as far as possible from her dead husband, stroked her sunset-red hair, and turned his attention once more to the problem of the Forest-spawn flapping about and setting all the chandeliers atremble.\n``I don't think that's the worst of our troubles, Sorrille,'' young Tirem suggested politely.\n``What's that? What do you--'' Sorrille almost choked on his tongue as he turned to see Naraya drift into the room with a tidy double-columned arrangement of mnisse-sedated Shadowchildren to her rear. A general murmur of distress ran through the room, and any of the servants who had outlasted the previous episode---either because of their unimpeachable dutifulness or because it was the best show they'd had in ages---began to inch their way toward the kitchen exit now.\n``And what a lucky usurper am I,'' thought Sorrille to himself. ``Not one but seven Shadowchildren to contend with as future subjects.''\n``Ah,'' said Naraya, halting her troops directly in front of the spot where Onri lay in state, ``I see you don't require my assistance, Sorrille, in meting justice to the despot after all.''\n``What's all this bother during dinner, anyway?'' demanded irritable old Baron Merrand. ``Is Sorrille king now or ain't he, and when is he going to do something about restoring the peace in here?''\n``He's right, y'know,'' counselled Roddain, managing a kindly smile. ``This all seems, indirectly or otherwise, to have some connection t'you, m'boy, and so everyone's 'specting you to make some sense of it. Ah'd hop to, was Ah you, 'specially if ye want the respect of the court in future.''\nSorrille's blood raced when he realized that his claim to the throne might well go uncontested henceforward, then again when he realized that a crisis of some moment was taking place.\n``Who's that woman, Sori? Do you know her?'' asked Belisa, catching him by the elbow. He held up a hand to indicate that she must lend him her forbearance, and approached Naraya and her retinue.\n``Milady Naraya,'' began, bowing, ``though your presence here is most unexpected, nonetheless is it quite welcome.'' He found regal circumlocution so much to his taste that he decided to experiment with a royal pronoun or two. ``But we cannot look kindly on the retainers you have brought with you. In short, we must ask you to see to it that they vacate the city immediately, whereupon we would be most pleased to give you a private audience and hear the purpose of your visit.''\n``Though I am ignorant in the ways of great cities, I believe a coronation is the method by which kings are given their office. Is that not correct?''\n``It is,'' conceded Sorrille cautiously, troubled by her amused expression as well as by her failure to respond directly to him.\n``And has there been a coronation here recently?''\n``Not for decades,'' put in the ever-helpful Tirem.\n``And I have also thought long that a king's public edict is the most binding of documents. Is that not correct as well?''\n``Why, yes, gal,'' said Roddain. ``That's the very line of reasonin' Sorrille here was tryin' to use on Onri. The stubborn ole fool wouldn't listen, and lookit the sorry state he's in now.''\n``Are you saying that, ipso facto, Sorrille's accession to the throne is a given thing?'' drawled Gauntti, regarding Roddain over his monocle rim.\n``Ipso fact, ergo sum, and all that. Ah can't see whah not. We all know that edict inside out, what with Onri talkin' 'bout it all through dinner the day that herald read it to the popylace.''\n``In that case,'' resumed Naraya, apparently well-pleased by the content of this interchange, ``I have come to claim my half of the throne. It was I who enabled your Sorrille to return with the requisite Shadowchild, whose acquaintance, I see, you have already made.'' She glanced at Sorrille's Child, currently cowering in a corner in an effort to hide from her.\n``Who _is_, she, Sori?'' asked Belisa plaintively, as if resigned to the fact that Sori would ignore her question and that the answer would prove unpleasant anyway.\n``Come hither, Child of the Shadows of Ashen Forest. Eat of the nectar I have brought you.'' Naraya outstretched her hand, with its generous pinch of mnisse in the palm, to Sorrille's half-reverted Child. The Child approached her furtively, with a contrite expression, lipped the mnisse from her hand like some timid hulk of a horse, and then quietly retreated.\nNaraya scanned her audience slowly before beginning, failing only to meet Sorrille's eyes and lingering inexplicably on Belisa's. ``As you can see, I hold sway over the Forest's Children. Should you choose not to honor the binding document I have mentioned, these seven will help me to assert my claim to the throne. Duke Sorrille, I know,''---here she looked at him significantly---``will support that claim fully.''\nSorrille sought frantically for a resolution to his dilemma. Were he to reject Naraya outright, as was most certainly his wont, the people of Renith would come to despise him for having exposed their city to a veritable plague of demons. No, inciting Naraya to loose seven Children on the city was hardly a viable means of persuading Renith to gladly award him the sovereignty he so desired. He would become, if he even survived the fiasco, a hated scapegoat, and he and Belisa would live under the constant threat of assassination.\nOn the other hand, if he pretended nonchalance in the face of Naraya's request---delight would definitely be stretching it---the populace might come to believe that he, as well as Naraya, held sway over the supernatural. That would mean a strengthened position on the throne, which was nothing to sneeze at. Even more importantly, if Naraya felt that he'd been cooperative, she might decide against feeding him to the Shadowchildren the first opportunity she got. Of course, cooperating with Naraya pretty effectively displaced Belisa from the picture. Ah, well, sacrifice _was_ the quintessence of noble and effective leadership.\n``Rest assured that I am your advocate,'' said Sorrille, with a bow.\nNaraya nodded and smiled. ``I am glad to hear it spoken, though our nights together had already helped me to take the true measure of your character.''\n``Who _is_ she, Sori?'' repeated Belisa.\nCerise Palmer is currently at work on the first book of a fantasy trilogy. She keeps in good creative shape by telling ``scary stories,'' nonstop, to her 3-year-old daughter.

Helbling\nCopyright (c) 1991\nRichard Fentz was working late in the lab again, cursing another failed attempt to repair his frequency pulsed ion beam. Without it, he had no chance of duplicating the results of his earlier efforts. He threw his hands up in despair, then ran them through his long strands of dark, loosely curled hair, tempted to pull out a lock or two.\nHis long hair was the only remaining badge of a bygone era, a decade of conflict between indulgence and academic excellence. Now the hair, like his patience and his credibility in the physics department here at the university, was wearing thin. He knew that few among the staff really believed he had ever successfully operated his mass reduction device.\nNo one was more happy about this, Richard also knew, than the Dean of Physics, Gene Royt. That the basic premise of his work held some promise, not even Gene had argued. He reviewed Richard's original paper on the subject before publication in \"K-Particle Physics Review\" and, as the department head, was more than willing to add his name as co-author. Now that months of work failed to produce a single repeatable demonstration, things were no longer quite so communal.\nAfter Gene's last visit to the lab, Richard was fairly certain that the success he had reported the previous week was viewed as a last ditch effort to save face, or worse yet, a futile attempt to prolong funding for the research. And now, now Royt was coming for another \"inspection\". Richard could imagine his taunting, gloating smirk staring back at him over the oak desk in the next room, the desk that Eugene Morris Royt kicked his feet up on while he administered project resources and lab allocations with all the grandeur and bearing of a monarch in exile. So Richard was scrambling at this late hour, determined to somehow make it work again, just one more time.\nBut it was already too late.\n\"Any change, Fentz?\" he heard from over his shoulder.\nRichard spun around on his bench stool to face the inimitable Dr. Royt as he walked his pudgy, bald, and annoying frame the rest of the way through the door.\n\"Nothing consistent,\" Richard exaggerated. He knew, they both knew, that there was nothing new to report.\n\"Have you given any thought to your next project?\" Gene asked, in some vaguely concerned way, not quite looking Richard in the eye.\n\"That's it, then? You're bagging it?\" Richard snapped, staring right back.\n\"Well, you've still got a couple thousand left on your grant. You are certainly free to continue until that runs out.\"\n\"That's very generous of you, Dr. Royt.\" Exaggeration, again.\n\"Now look, there is no need to get sarcastic. You've been given every opportunity to prove your hypothesis, Rick. I think it's time you face the corner you've painted yourself into and admit that this just isn't going anywhere.\"\nRick, huh? That was a first, Richard thought. \"Look, Gene, it's late. I'm sorry, I just guess I'm a bit short-fused right now. I'm sure that you'll find something suitable for me to work on as soon as this grant runs its course. Do you have any ideas you want me to pursue?\"\nNo, I won't argue with you, you pompous bastard, Richard thought. Not tonight. Maybe later, after the next grant is approved and I have another obscure little space to work in for another six months, possibly at a school with a real physics wing. Meanwhile, crawl back into your office. Go back to sleep in your comfortable chair.\n\"Well, we'll get together next week and talk about it. I suggest you get some of that much needed rest in the meantime.\"\n\"Thank you, Doctor. Good night.\"\n\"And thank you, God,\" Richard muttered, under his breath, as Dr. Royt turned to leave. That was about as much mock sympathy as he could stomach without subsequent acts of violence. At least Royt hadn't found out about the broken generator. Did the senior physicist on campus resent him more because he was younger or because he was at least working on some idea of his own? Richard wasn't sure and no longer cared. That Royt took pleasure in his eventual failure was enough for him to at least contemplate with relish his private image of the violent act he knew he would never commit.\nHe spun back around to face his lab bench, reaching to pick up Test Ball Number One.\n\"Why won't it work any more?!\" He tossed the ball back and forth from left to right a couple more times, then replaced it reverently on its little plastiglas pedestal atop the bench copy of his thesis.\n\"Potential for Mass Reduction Effects of Controlled Magnetic Flux Environment Ion Particle Beam Target Media, by Richard Morris Fentz\", read the cover of the paper. The result of several semesters of work, it was the very sweat and blood of his brain, the most promising of the many papers he had written during his twenty five odd years of research. It had a nice ring to it, too, he thought, and a fairly sound basis in the theorems of other recently proven corollaries to some of the lesser known theories of relativity and subatomic particle physics, all of which was rather pointless now.\nHe reached, one more time, for his stainless steel trophy. The polished globe had started out at a very precise five pounds. It now weighed four point nine three two two five pounds, for reasons his paper explained, but no one would believe, because he could not make it happen again. He wished he could afford to have the ball analyzed, but as as the Dean of this gigantic four person department had reminded him, he only had a little money left in the grant, and he would need it to try to repair the beam generator. The thing wasn't really that sophisticated; it was little more than an X-ray machine with a frequency knob, with the exception of the emitter tube, yet it's role in the project was critical.\nLooking back, he wondered if Royt's willingness to lend his name to the paper wasn't really just a reason to get the generator into the department. The few papers Royt had published in the last few years had been met with little fanfare in the scientific community. Richard had been in the field long enough by now to know that they had received little acknowledgement of any kind. Royt's own efforts to get funding, inside or outside the barriers of this rustic little liberal arts university, had all failed. If he could get just a few whiz bang gizmo's, Richard figured, Royt thought he would probably be able to attract some of that inspired endowment money. The professor had never shown any genuine respect for the devices themselves, only for their ability to generate more research revenue.\nNow, thanks to Richard, Bramer Valley University could boast a pulsed frequency controlled ion beam generator among its educational assets. Had he actually used the beam in his ever so thoroughly calibrated, measured, magnetically controlled environment, to reduce the mass of this metal egg? He was starting to wonder himself.\nDr. Royt and the others were convinced that, unlike Test Ball Number Two, now in place on the digital scale at the focal point of his ion generator, this ball had NEVER weighed five pounds. He imagined the guesses they must be making behind his back. Did he specially fabricate some alloy to appear identical to Ball Two? Or did he rig the scale to somehow read constantly low only when Ball One was on it?\nNone of them could explain what he somehow did, because they didn't believe it had been done. Yet Richard remembered every detail of the Event like it was ten minutes ago.\nHe had first adjusted the large blue dial on the panel in front of him. It controlled the strength of the field inside the magnetically tuned environment that was the top of his test bench. A square frame of thin gauge angle steel formed a skeleton cube the size of a tea crate on the soapstone surface of the bench. The cube formed the perimeters of the Hemholtz cage, for all intents and purposes, a magnetic box. Then, time to continue the standard sequence: he tweaked the flux density, the red knob next to the blue one, and reached for the power switch to the particle beam generator that feed its frequency-modulated pulses into the cage.\nRichard had liked the colored knobs. He added them early on in the project for a sort of Sesame Street effect. See here. Push this button. Make the little ball weigh less than before. See here. It was really a sideways insult to Royt, who really didn't have a clue as to how Richard's equations worked. Now the knobs no longer amused him. Push this button, and break the virtually irreplaceable imported particle beam generator you stayed an extra three semesters here at Backwater U to use. Perhaps he should have gone the Royt route, sought tenure and power, then at least he would now be free to continue without interference.\nSome weeks earlier on in the project, the gym teacher who taught fitness in the classroom on the floor below had come into the room, ranting and panting, totally unglued because she heard there was a particle beam weapon shooting subatomic pieces around above her. She demanded that the entire project be shut down or moved to another building, preferably one in another town. He had assured her that it was not a weapon, that the radiation from these \"teenee little particles\" were less harmful than the glow the headsup map and gauge displays in her car, but she wouldn't buy it. If it's so harmless, she had asked, why do the building lights keep fluttering every time the damn thing gets turned on?\nDoctor Royt had come through for him then, he remembered. Department heads were actually good for some things. In his mind he could see Gene talking to her, making gestures with his hands, explaining that while the generator did consume large amounts of power, it didn't actually produce much at all. Kind of a mechanical government. This she could understand.\nWith everything on-line at the same time for the first time, Richard had chuckled to himself as he threw the switch. He watched as the lights dimmed as always. Once, twice, three times, then a fourth flicker, as each of the beam's internal power supplies kicked in. He wondered if she was down there now, watching the lights dim, worrying that she was being bombarded. He had been forced to modify the beam's power feed circuitry so it wouldn't blow the breaker every time they used it.\nThe so-called physics wing of the building consisted of Royt's office next door, this lab, and two classrooms. It was really wired for the language and sociology classes the founding fathers of the school had intended. The intrusion of technology studies onto the curriculum had been a concession from the start; the concession had never extended as far as the facilities. Modifying the beam generator had allowed Richard to avoid spending a big part of his grant on rewiring the lab to accommodate the special equipment.\nNow it came up, one grid bank at a time, instead of all at once. He wondered again, briefly, if his modifications had somehow caused the beam to fail. This additional compromise of working on an anorexic budget, he though, would be the most laughable of all the possible gotchas. For want of a watt, and all that.\nThe lights steadied and he waited and watched, as the hum from the beam leveled off in its low frequency drone. Five, ten, twenty seconds later and he watched in awe as the mass reading on the steel ball dipped. An immediate drop of some fraction of an ounce was showing plainly on the six figure LED display of the digital scale supporting the steel test sphere!\nBut that was before, just that once, and only once.\nLike some mad Faustian scholar on a frantic quest for the Lost Chord, Richard had spent the previous several days struggling to repair the beam generator: calls to the manufacturer in Germany; runs to the electronic component store for parts; a trip to the airport for components shipped via overnight carrier. His own lectures he had long since delegated to the the other two post-grad minions. He took meals in the lab room, slept briefly back in his dorm room, then returned three or four hours later for another go at it.\nNo luck again tonight. No last minute save before Royt's little visit. The LED's on the power panel of the beam generator still stared back at him in cold, dark defiance. He glanced over his notebook. The lines started running together.\nRichard stood up from the bench for a moment and started to swoon. Too many skipped meals. He decided to take a short stroll down the hall to the vending machines for another coffee and a stretch of the legs, then return refreshed to begin again. When he got there, he asked for the usual coffee and doughnuts, but the machine responded with \"Sorry, that selection is currently unavailable.\"\n\"You piece of crap,\" he cursed, raising his arm to swing at this other mechanical adversary of long standing, then in his fury dizzied again, reminded of just how little attention his own personal needs had received in these last few days. A sudden desire for fresh air drew him out of the building and into the night.\nAt this hour few students could be seen on campus. Most were in their own dorm rooms by now, mulling over tomorrow's assignments or tonight's lover. He smiled at the memory of this term's confused first-time dormers, amazed that one so old as he could still be living on campus. He never explained it, preferring to let them think that they, too, might be forty five before they finish with school.\nHe cast a glance over the skyline, seeing with a new eye the lights of the other campus buildings as they mingled with those of the downtown highrises blocks away. A pretty night. Though no stars seemed to penetrate the cloud cover, he imagined them above him, looking down in quiet admiration as he gazed up from below, poised to walk back indoors and finish making The Big Discovery. Pity I'll have to disappoint you, he thought.\nHe walked back into the building feeling refreshed and renewed. As he strolled into the lab room and up to the bench, parking himself onto the stool, he shivered, unsettled. Something was wrong.\nHe looked first at the beam generator, parked in its usual spot on the floor to the right of the bench, with most of its guts spread out next to it, wires and components dangling together like a mound of capsized spiders on a plate of orange and blue spaghetti. He looked at his tools and odd assortment of meters, lying there where he'd left them on the next to the generator. Then he looked at his bench top.\nThe damn ball, Ball Number Two, was gone!!\nHe jumped out of his seat and ran out the door to the lab and down the hall. Whoever had taken it mustn't be far away! But as he stood in the front of the building, where he had stood moments earlier admiring the skyline, he could see no one.\nNor had he seen anyone, he remembered, as he came back in the building mintues ago. So they must be still in the building. He ran back in, chasing up and down the halls. Locked, locked and dark, every door was locked and not a person to be found.\nAnother frat prank? He wondered. Or maybe one of Royt's little mind games? He strutted towards Gene's office, ready to read him the first three chapters of Inferno, the Gaelic translation. Royt's door? Royt was sitting there in his think position, feet on the desk and arms behind his head, snoring away. No, he thought, it's not Royt.\nHe finally decided that whoever stole it didn't really comprise a threat to the project. Sometime during his running up and down the halls, the truth had come home. In his panic to find the missing ball, enough of his mind was freed from solving the generator problem that the answer came to him.\nThe emitter tube was fried.\nThe little hunk of glass and metal was more than just expensive and nearly impossible to replace, at least for him. It was the key to the generator's ability. The coatings of the tube, consisting of highly refined rare earth elements, its superconductive filaments, special crystalline housing, polyplast-ceramic insulators, superconductive interconnects, all combined to give the beam its special properties. Most of these properties could be summed up simply as an order of magnitude improvement in fine control over the intensity of the beam produced. Some properties were manifest in the beam's ability to rapidly respond to changes in input. In Royt-speak, it was simply Bandwidth, with a capital \"B\". \"Gotta have that bandwidth in all your beam generators,\" Richard mumbled in recollection. \"And response time? Hell, yes!! We can give your response time.\" He snapped himself out of used lab equipment salesman mode long enough to remember that these were the properties he had taken advantage of in bringing his calculations to tangible reality.\nHad he zapped the tube during its first use, with his power supply workarounds? Or did it get zapped by some sort of feedback from the magnetic tomb of the Hemholtz cage? It didn't matter now. No emitter tube, no generator. No generator? Well, the rest didn't matter either, not anymore.\nHe returned to the lab bench and started working his way through his notes; the pages of records of the combinations of replacement components he had swapped out clearly showed that he had by this time replaced the entire unit, except for the damned emitter tube. He had simply blocked it out, he guessed, until he was distracted long enough to forget to forget.\nThree hours later, he was still in his back-wrenching hunch on the bench stool, bent over the trailing end of his notes. Somewhere in these numbers, these wonderfully fascinating, unique, bizarre relationships between mass and externally applied energy, somewhere in there was the answer to why his dead emitter tube was setting on the floor next to him in his dead generator. It still seemed pretty damn pointless, he thought, reaching a last time for Ball One. He bounced it back and forth between left and right a couple more times before setting it back, no not on the pedestal, he thought, let's put it over there on the scale, where Ball Two would have been, where Ball Two would now be reading some low mass value of its own.\nAs he placed Ball One on the scale, his jaw dropped. What? The LED's now showed that it now weighed four point seven two nine pounds. Another stare of disbelief showed no change in the reading.\nHe reached out and yanked Ball One off the scale like he was avoiding some kind of electric shock, stared at it, tossed it up the air a couple of times. It felt the same. He had played with it so much the last few days he could probably detect a quarter percent change in weight just by the feel. He reached back to return it to the scale again when he noticed that it was no longer reading zero?\n\"Oh God\", he muttered, \"Maybe a flaky scale screwed me up after all. Check your measuring equipment, fool.\" Another lesson in elementary empirical science from the makers of cold fusion. He pressed the reset\/recalibrate button on the scale and it returned to zero. But as he did so, he saw something that had escaped his scrutiny before.\nThe ball dip zone, that little curved receptacle area where the ball rested on top of the scale without falling off, seemed deeper than before. In fact it appeared considerably deeper. Why didn't he noticed it? Lack of sleep?\nPlacing Ball One back in the dip zone, he could see that it sank deeper than it had before. Time, he thought, for bed. Much too late. Powers of observation now reduced.\nHe stood up from the stool, then almost doubled over, as his joints protested resentfully over their lack of use. He stretched slowly, first his arms up overhead, then his legs, one at time, forward then back, forward then back, and found himself falling ...\nAs the room abruptly shifted from bright fluorescent to dim moonlight, he could see his hands, stretched out in front of him for balance, suspended over a glassy plane of sparkling light.\nIn the next second and a half, a thousand possibilities blazed through his mind. A near death experience? A heart attack at the bench? No time for wonder. The surface of the lab floor came up to meet his chin, and he went out.\nRichard awoke some undetermined moments later in unbelievable pain. His pounding head was cradled in the lap of someone with a black head, a head he saw looking down over him, busy applying some medication to his upper lip. He reached up to feel it; he must have nearly bit it off. The black-headed, perhaps hooded person pushed his hand away, mumbling something unintelligible.\nAs the mumble concluded, a feminine, slightly mechanical-sounding voice said, \"Be still. Do not move.\"\nHe fought the urge to struggle, then yielded to the waves of relief now replacing the pain in his lip as the hooded one smeared some kind of salve slowly from one side of his lip to the other.\n\"Be calm. You will be fine,\" the voice continued.\nA distinctly close splashing noise broke him away from staring into the now noticeably feminine eyes of the black hooded person stroking his forehead, while the surface beneath him gently rocked back and forth. He started struggling again, but she, yes, it was a she, he knew that much, held him firmly in place, then mumbled again.\nMoments later, he heard the voice say, \"It is fine. You are in a boat.\"\nThe voice, he noticed, appeared to be coming out of a little box on her shoulder. He looked past her shoulder to the same twinkling field of night stars he had seen those brief moments before conking out. Even on the clearest night, he had not remembered such a crystal-bright sprinkle of sky glitter.\nHe looked back into her eyes, soft, caring, concerned eyes that they appeared to be, and started to fade out again.\nLater he awoke to see those same soft, caring, and yes now plainly beautiful green eyes still staring down at him between cascading locks of dark auburn hair. \"Gyeslowtenden,\" she said. \"How are you feeling?\" asked the little box stuck to her shoulder.\n\"I feel fine,\" Richard said, not stopping to think before he answered. \"Where am I?\"\n\"Kmen yar shmendahike,\" she said, or something like it. The box said, \"Save that question for a later time.\" She continued to speak, but he stopped listening to her for the moment; the box was a little easier to understand.\n\"You must take your rest at this time. Soon, you will be questioned and you will be answered.\" She smiled at him.\nA Florence Nightingale smile? He had not looked at a woman in admiration since the last time he took a summer vacation, some two years earlier. A smile like that on a face like that with such a deliciously foreign accent? Accent?! Maybe, he shuddered, may his NDE was more D than N.\nFor a moment he had forgotten that matchbook-sized voice-actuated language interpreters, like the one he was apparently now conversing with, didn't exist, not outside of UFO Enquirer's Update, anyway. Yet her persisting smile dissuaded him from panic. She mumbled again and the box told him to open his mouth, then swallow. Richard opened up and she slipped a capsule between his lips. He swallowed, then slept, dreaming a relaxed, safe and warm dream of a relaxed, safe, calm boat ride with a delightful green-eyed woman with a delightful accent and long, luscious curls of the warmest brown hair, flowing on and on in a sea of warm and relaxed safety ...\nWhen he awoke, she was still looking him over. Next to her were more faces, considerably less warm and definitely not relaxed. They were arguing amongst themselves, as near as he could tell, in the same language he had heard from her lips before.\n\"Enough now, he is awakening,\" announced one of the boxes on one of the shoulders. Each of the three, yes there were three of them, each of the three people now looking him over stopped abruptly in their discussion. The Auburn One reached out toward him and lifted him gently up into a sitting position.\n\"It is time now. You have a few mintues,\" her box said, \"to ask and be asked.\"\nRichard looked at her and her two companions. The one on her right was a square-jawed and seriously handsome blonde man of perhaps thirty, the one on her left a dark haired woman who looked remarkably like her. Maybe they were sisters. They were all wearing the same dark garb, form-fitting and shiny, like wet silk. Richard started to ask them a question, then stopped, struggling for words, as he stared past the three of them, towards the craft, the boat, as she called it, that they all must have been in together some recent moments or hours earlier.\nIt was quite unlike any boat he had seen before. In shape it appeared similar to the motorized inflatables he had watched down at the river in the summer, boats that pulled skiers around and swamped canoes. This boat did look much like them, except for the fishlike fins protruding from the back, fins that even now looked like they were flapping back and forth a bit.\n\"Do not concern yourself with the nature of your rescue craft, Richard Joseph Fentz,\" Auburn's box announced.\n\"You have me at a disadvantage,\" he responded. The Auburn One looked at him with a puzzled expression. \"I don't know your names.\"\nA smile of discovery dawning in her eyes, she said, \"Dana\"\n\"Dana,\" said her box.\n\"Jaaspendt,\" said the blonde gentleman, as did his box.\n\"Yantz,\" replied the remaining pair.\n\"Well, Dana,\" he asked, \"Where am I, how did I get here, and what is it that you want to know?\"\nDana looked at her two companions, then back at him, and began. \"Richard Joseph Fentz, here is--\"\n\"Please, call me Richard.\"\n\"Richard, here is Lake Fentz. You arrived here in the same manner these did. What we want to know is when the rest of your party is going to arrive.\"\nDana reached her hand out to him, then opened it to reveal a silver ball about the size of a pea, then with her other hand gave him another, close to the size of Ball Number Two. Of course, the \"BALL NUMBER TWO\" label on the side was a bit of a hint.\nRichard reached out and took them from her, examining each. Then he reached up to her shoulder, touching her little translation box. He looked back over her shoulder at their boat.\n\"Shit,\" he said.\nHer box made a sort of a bleeping noise and she and Yantz and Jaaspendt laughed, the first smiles he had seen on the faces of the other two.\n\"What can you tell me about your equations, Richard?\" her box asked him. \"We know you had set up a repeating series of converging parameters to validate your hypothesis regarding matter\/mass displacement. We do not know which of these parameters you used in your experiments at Bramer Valley.\"\nHe tried to deny the obvious, to himself at least. He didn't answer.\n\"How far apart were your time intervals on the power initialization sequence of the beam generator? It is very important that we know.\"\n\"About two seconds each, I would guess,\" he answered without thinking.\n\"How long was it between when you first operated the generator and, well, when you arrived here?\"\n\"Oh, I guess about five days.\"\nDana looked at him like he was truly gone. Maybe she was right, but she took that moment to reach up and touch her little box, as did her companions. Their next several minutes of conversation were not translated, save for occasional glances of suspicion or perhaps contempt that required no mechanical interpretation.\nThen she shook her head, in some obvious disagreement with the other two, and reached up to switch on her translator.\n\"Richard, we have a problem. You came to be here by result of your work. I think we did not make that clear. I think you do not realize how far you have traveled. These balls of steel in your hands? They are portions of the test balls you were using in your 'mass reduction' experiments.\"\nRichard nodded in acknowledgement. She continued.\n\"The small one? This is the inner core of the first test ball from the first time you ran the experiment. The larger one? The second ball, with some part of the equipment beneath it. The next run. You, with a spherical portion of your lab room. That is now out there, in the water.\" She paused, pointing out toward the center of the lake.\n\"So here is the future. How far into the future?\"\n\"That is not an issue now, Richard,\" she replied, genuine worry resting rigid on her face.\n\"How do you know of my work?\"\n\"Richard, when those parts of your lab disappeared, when you disappeared with them, people of your time began to take your work very seriously. They studied your published papers, to replicate your results, though they apparently did not understand them. In the time span of five years from you left, a new military science formed around your efforts. 'Mass Reduction', to eliminate people, war engines, cities. Without bodies, without rubble, without residual radiation. An ideal weapon, by the standards of your time.\"\n\"Eventually,\" she continued, \"it was used for such purposes. Not until much later was the nature of your discoveries truly understood. The users of your 'Mass Reduction' technology thought they were destroying their targets, not relocating them. The amount of mass displacement the target experienced was, we know, a linear function of the energy applied, nothing in your setup would change that. The amount of temporal displacement, and how long it took for the 'send' to take effect after application of the required energy, these relationships were more complex. They were not fully explained by your published calculations.\"\n\"The small, then larger balls, \" Richard observed, looking blankly into his palms.\n\"Then you. Exactly.\"\n\"So where is the controversy?\" Richard asked, visibly struggling to grasp all the ramifications of what he had just heard. \"If you know all this, what difference does it make how long it took for my initial test to actually work? I'm here now!\"\n\"Because, Richard, your lab was not the last sphere to be transmitted.\"\nRichard looked at Dana, at Yantz, then over to Jaaspendt. They were a serious looking bunch. He stood up, wobbling a bit, waved off Dana's effort to assist him, then strolled over to the boat, walking around it, kicking a pebble or two from side to side, while he clutched the two steel balls, one in each hand, until his knuckles paled around the larger ball. It, the boat, looked like an alien creature, its long, narrow, yet rigid equivalent of a gunwale sweeping back on each side to melt into a fin that swept out and down, apparently serving as propeller, rudder, and keel. Amazing! And what powered it, he could only guess.\nHe peered inside the boat and saw a bag of some transparent material, filled with remnants of his lab bench: the scale, pieces of the beam generator. In another bag were some of his notebooks, and there in the prow, tucked between a couple of flaps of whatever made up the boat, he could see a couple more bags filled, he suspected, with more souvenirs of the lab. In the one bag, he thought he could make out the shape to be the bench copy of his paper. The other bag was messy, filled with dripping cloth somethings.\n\"NO!\" he gasped. \"Not Royt's Florsheims?\" But he knew that they were there in the bag, that Royt's feet and his blood and some portion of his pant legs were in there with them.\nIn a gasping breath of willpower, Richard turned away from the boat and faced the lake. His gaze stretched out from before him for a stretch before coming to rest out in the center, on what appeared to be a platform. The brightness of the stars would not have been enough to show it here in the night, but the soft blue lights floating all around it gave it a strangely luminescent appearance, like a faint spiral nebula in a field of softly twinkling darkness. It was a round, uniformly flat surface jutting up just a couple of feet above the calm of the water surrounding it. And in the center of the platform stood a roughly circular lump, looking like a crude attempt at a Buckminster Fuller version of a cutaway house. He couldn't make out the contents of this cutaway castle on the sea, but he knew what they were.\nHe turned away from the water and toward the others, then paused, spinning back again to face the lake.\nFentz Lake, the perfectly round lake.\nFentz Lake, he would later discover, was one of many such lakes that formed in the hemispherical cavities left by the transmission of military bases, towns, and cities over the many years since his abrupt departure from the university. It was also the first of many such lakes soon to be abruptly filled with a fast moving municipality from the past.\nRichard turned back to stare at his rescuers. He wondered if they were part of a centuries long vigil monitoring the lake, waiting for the First Arrival. And the round platform under his falling lab room, where the wall that had stood between him and Royt's desk was now a crumbled piece of lath and plaster, was this platform a sort of catchers mitt for temporal relics? That notion squeezed a chuckle out of him. He started laughing a little louder, gathering return stares from the trio.\nHe wondered if he could really help these people to determine just when his city would arrive? They probably already assumed that the answer was no, given his last couple of admissions. But he could help them, he hoped, to cope with the cultural earthquakes to follow. The little boxes on their lapels would help.\nWould he be able to help though, he wondered, if others among his papers had also been thoroughly scrutinized after his premature departure.\nHe looked down into his hands again, now cramped from clutching his globes of steel. His left arm was feeling long already, lugging the larger one around. He switched the two balls, putting the big one in his right, then reached back and with a wide swing, plopped it out in to the water. A cry of protest arose from the trio behind him, but he ignored it. They had other souvenirs, and more they could gather. He put the small ball in his right hand, then swung up and out, going for that forty five degree shot, and watched as the little projectile arced out of view.\nStanding there next to the water, seeing the last of the waves created by his first launch fading in the glimmer of the night sky, he realized that he had finally escaped obscurity. If he could just slip back into it, like Ball One and Two, now safe on the bottom of the lake.\nHe began to stroll back toward the group. They would forget all about the little steel orbs, he assured himself, when he told them about the other papers. Unless, of course, they had already read them.\nD.E.

I was in my apartment, but the Jason Snell furniture in my bedroom was different. There were curtains instead of the awful roll-up blinds I had bought at K-Mart, and framed pictures were hung on the walls where my posters had been tacked.\"\nShannon came over to my apartment at seven with the dozen ball-point pens and extra magazines she wanted to give me.\nYou've got to understand this about her: she gives people gifts all the time. Weird gifts. Pens and magazines, paper clips and key chains. When I asked her where she got all the blue disposable pens, she'd only say: \"They just turn up.\"\nThis night, I took them without any questions. I glanced at the magazine subscription labels, just to assure myself that the mistakes were there. Her name was Shannon Erica Steinman, but the labels were always addressed to Shannon D. Steinman or Erica S. Steinman.\nSometimes, to spoil my fun, she steamed off the magazine labels. I never bothered asking why.\nAll of us have a few of our own quirks; I'd like to think Shannon's only weird one is gift-giving. Other than her pen and magazine philanthropy, she's the kind of person I'd call normal --- working at a day-care center while toiling with the idea of going back to school to become a teacher.\n\"I'm not sure, Jer,\" she told me that night, when the subject came up. \"I like working with the kids, and I think I'd like teaching, but I don't know if I could stand going back to school.\"\n\"If you go back to school, you'll be able to teach kids instead of just babysitting them.\"\n\"Yeah, but now I get paid to go to the beach and to movies and to play Monopoly with these kids. The biggest decision I have to make during any given week is whether to play Four Square or Hopscotch.\"\nShe and I were up very late that night, mostly because neither of us had much else to do except talk. Her boyfriend was in L.A. on business and Shannon didn't have many other friends, so her social calendar was empty. As for me, well, I'm sort of a hermit. If I weren't, would I be talking to you now? No offense. I'm just being honest.\nSo Shannon and I sat around my apartment all night, talking about our shoe sizes and what our favorite yogurt flavors were and, most importantly, how early we got up on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons when we were kids.\nShe got up late, and her mother always made a big breakfast on Saturdays, so she never got to see any of the cool cartoons that were on early. Me, I was an early riser back then --- I'd be up in time to catch the end of the farm report, and then I'd sit through thirty minutes of Mister Ed before finally hitting the animated excitement I'd been searching for.\nWe weren't bored by this stuff, believe it or not. The only thing that finished our conversation was sleep --- at about one in the morning, we both conked out next to each other on my couch. She shook me awake at threea.m..\n\"It's late,\" she said. \"Do you mind if I spend the night here?\"\n\"Sure,\" I told her. \"You take my bed. I'll sleep on the couch.\"\n\"No, I'll sleep on the couch.\"\n\"No. Take the bed.\"\n\"No. It's your bed. I'll just sleep here.\"\nI shook my head.\n\"Okay,\" she said. \"We'll both sleep on your bed.\"\n\"Well, there's certainly plenty of room,\" I said, nudging her toward the bedroom door.\nThat was a running joke of ours --- I had a king-sized bed, one that I bought during a relationship I'd had a year or so before. Michele and I knew we weren't going to be together forever, but in the meantime, we needed a bigger bed.\nThe day the bed was delivered, Michele and I split up. The two events are not related, but the size of the bed and its emptiness had become a source of great amusement to Shannon. It was slightly less amusing to me.\nStill wearing our T-shirts and shorts, we slid into bed. Now, I swear I never gave any thought to the fact that we were in bed together. We were just friends. That was all we'd ever be.\nShe snuggled against me, and I put my arm around her. I mumbled a tired \"Good night\" and closed my eyes.\n\"I should warn you,\" she said. \"I turn in my sleep.\"\n\"Okay,\" I said, and closed my eyes.\nAfter a few minutes on her side, Shannon made a low groan and turned onto her back. A few more minutes, and she was on her other side.\nBefore she could turn onto her stomach, I was snoring softly.\nSomewhere around three in the morning, I felt Shannon move next to me. Then she turned from her right side onto her back. That was when the world changed.\nThe stereo was playing a song I had never heard before. I was in my apartment, but the furniture in my bedroom was different. There were curtains instead of the awful roll-up blinds I had bought at K-Mart, and framed pictures were hung on the walls where my posters had been tacked.\nI sorted most of that information out later, though I was flooded with all of it immediately. Of the most importance, though, was what I found myself doing as the song I had never heard played in the background.\nShannon and I were making love.\nI was shocked, of course, not just because I had never expected anything like that to happen between us, but because I couldn't remember how we got from sleeping next to each other to having sex with the stereo on. It was as if I had blacked out.\nI could see in Shannon's eyes that she was also shocked by the turn of events, but that didn't make her ask me to stop what we were doing.\nWhen we were done, as I held her, I finally noticed the curtains.\n\"Shannon, what happened to my blinds?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"My cheap K-mart blinds are gone.\"\nA brief pause then: \"God, you're right. And your posters are gone, too.\"\nI flipped the light on and looked around my bedroom. The framed pictures on the walls were mostly prints I'd seen before. They were Shannon's.\nOne picture, however, was one neither of us had seen before.\nShannon looked gorgeous, of course... her darker complexion balanced well with the white dress. And though the expression on my face was typically stupid, the tuxedo made me almost seem dignified.\nBelow the picture was printed Jeremy and Shannon, September 16, 1991.\nI looked at Shannon. She was holding up her hand, showing me the wedding ring she was wearing.\n\"What the hell is going on?\" I asked her.\nShe bent over next to the bed, picked up something --- I could see that it was a magazine --- and glanced at it before tossing it to me.\n\"Look at the label.\"\nIt was addressed to Shannon and Jeremy Alden.\nI was about to say something else to her when a wave of dizziness hit me. Maybe, I reasoned, this is all just a dream. That's it. I'm dreaming.\nAnd I was in bed again, next to Shannon, fully clothed. She was still asleep, slowly turning to lay on her left side.\nBetween movements, I was in the right world. The moment Shannon turned to her left, I felt that world slip away.\nI was in Shannon's apartment, in her bed. We weren't making love this time; it felt like we might have done it a few minutes before, but now we were just laying in bed, my arms around her, naked.\n\"Shannon?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Do you remember the last time? Just a few minutes ago?\"\n\"We were in your apartment. My pictures were on your...\"\nShe glanced around her walls. All her pictures were there, right where she left them.\n\"Do you have a wedding ring this time?\"\nShe held up her hand. \"Nope. An engagement ring, though.\"\n\"What the hell is going on?\"\n\"I think it might have something to do with the magazines,\" she said. But before I could ask her what she meant, her bedroom door opened and someone flipped on the light switch.\nIt was Steve.\n\"Oh, no,\" he said. \"You can't...\"\nFor a minute he looked hurt, like I'd expect someone to look the moment he found his fianc\u017de --- I knew then that the ring on Shannon's finger wasn't from me --- in bed with another man.\nThen Steve made the transition to the other expression I expected to see. It was rage --- pure jealous rage. He had always been jealous of my relationship with Shannon because he wondered why she needed to have any other male companionship if he was around.\nNow, in this world, his jealousy had been borne out. I was sleeping with Shannon behind his back.\nHe punched me quite a few times, I think. I was so shocked by the whole turn of events that I wasn't really paying attention. It hurt a lot, I know that. Shannon was screaming and crying in the background. Steve was yelling at me to get the hell out, and when I didn't do anything but sit there, he hit me again.\nThen, as he hit me in the head for the umpteenth time, I started to lose it. I'd never been knocked unconscious before, but it looked like this would be my chance. Then I felt Shannon shifting, and knew that it wasn't Steve's right hook that had caused my dizziness.\nIt was time to leave that world. And not a moment too soon.\nShe was moving again, next to me, shifting from her left side onto her stomach. She was awake in the different realities, but here she was still sleeping.\nI think it might have something to do with the magazines, she had said. Magazines?\nShannon moved to her stomach. The world slid away again.\nI could tell I was in a hotel room, just because of the smell. Whatever hotel rooms smelled of, whether it was carpet cleaner or industrial toilet bowl cleaner, this was one of those rooms. Light seeped in through cheap tan curtains.\nI was having sex again. It seemed to be a recurring theme, for some reason. It certainly wasn't because I had a history as a great lover. Far from it.\nThis time, I wasn't looking down into the deep, brown, loving eyes of Shannon Steinman. The hair my fingers were running through was long and blonde, not short and brown. The eyes I was staring at were blue.\n\"Oh, yeah, honey,\" she moaned in what could've only been a New York accent. I almost laughed out loud.\nWhat was this world? The world where I got to shack up in hotels with bimbos with bad accents?\nOkay, I'll admit something else to you, since I've told you so much already. I've always been attracted to blondes, just like every other American male around. They're supposed to be the sexiest ones, more inherently attractive than any dark-haired woman can be.\nBut with a catch: I've also always said that while blondes tended to be prettier, the most striking women, the ones that make you turn your head when you're walking down the street, even if you're walking down that street with your own girlfriend, have dark hair. There aren't many of them like that --- Shannon was one.\nBut like Pavlov's puppies at feeding time, when I see a blonde, I start drooling. It's undignified and unintelligent, but I do it. Maybe it was the forbidden nature of them --- they were attractive and I couldn't have them. I had never even kissed a blonde before.\nNow I was having sex with one.\nBut while it was all going on, a part of me was busy asking questions. Where's Shannon? What about the magazines?\nIt turned out that the blonde's name was Holly and she was from New Jersey, not New York. She and I had first met in a hotel bar two weeks ago and had retreated to a room upstairs after both of us had a little too much to drink.\nI was lucky. I had managed to prod her into some reminiscence without having the faintest idea about my history with her. I also found it funny that it had been too much alcohol that had brought us together because I don't drink. In 25 years, my total alcoholic consumption was probably five beers and four glasses of wine.\nNot that I was an incredibly moral person, thumping a Bible and preaching about That Demon Alcohol every time I got the opportunity. I just decided, fairly early on in my life that not only did I not like the taste of alcohol, I didn't like the way it changed people.\nSo I bought into blondes but not into booze. Consider me batting .500 on the Red-Blooded American Male scale.\nBut laying there next to Holly, I wondered if that choice was the right one. Should I have stayed as adamantly different as I was in my own world?\nIn my life, I had slept with a grand total of one woman --- and I didn't even love Michele --- and I was an emotional wreck. Here it was different.\nIt's easy to make moral decisions when you've got no way to see the alternative. You just make your choices, take your chances and wonder about what might have been.\nI'm insecure enough about my life. I didn't need to be shown what I'd been missing, but here it was.\nI left Holly, found my car in the hotel parking garage and drove home. I kept waiting for this dream or other reality or whatever it was to end, but I was still in the world of voluptuous blondes and too many margaritas when I reached my apartment.\nAs I jogged up the steps, I knew I had to call Shannon. After all, she was my only link back to the other world, the one where I was still laying under a ragged blue comforter with my best friend on her stomach next to me.\nThen I opened the door to the apartment. Shannon was standing inside, holding a baby in her arms.\n\"There you are!\" she said. \"I was worried.\"\nI looked at the baby. \"Is that...\"\n\"The baby book says her name's Diana Alden, six months old,\" she told me. \"We're parents. God, Jer, we're parents.\"\nI was supposed to ask her about the magazines, about how we could be leading the lives of other people who were ourselves. But instead, all I could think about was a blonde named Holly as I stared into the shiny eyes of my daughter.\n\"There's something else,\" Shannon said, and picked up a magazine off the kitchen table.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Look at the cover.\"\nIt was a picture of the embattled president, trying hard to win re-election despite an economic downturn and a tough challenger. Four years in the White House had turned his hair markedly gray, but his eyebrows were as thick and dark as ever.\n\"President Dukakis?\" I asked.\n\"This world really is screwed up,\" she said to me.\nOh, Shannon, you don't know the half of it, I thought, and then the dizziness hit me.\nFor a split second I thought about waking her, ending this thing we had fallen into as soon as possible. But before I could even grab her shoulders, let alone start shaking her awake, she moved from her stomach to her right side.\nThe world went one way, and we went the other.\nMagazines. I've got to remember the magazines.\nI was drinking coffee. I despise coffee, so I put down the cup as soon as I could, but I still had to swallow the foul-tasting stuff that was in my mouth.\nI was sitting in the living room of a house I had never seen before. Some of the decorations, however, were familiar --- they were Shannon's.\nAcross with me, sitting with their arms around each other in what I somehow knew was marital bliss were Shannon and Steve.\n\"So, do you like the place?\" Steve asked me.\n\"Oh, of course,\" I said. \"It's great.\"\n\"Well, it's certainly better organized now than before the wedding,\" Steve said.\nWedding. I was getting good at making these guesses, but I didn't want to push it too far. I told them that I had to go to the bathroom and excused myself.\nWhen I came back, they were still there, smiling. I was wondering how Shannon managed to do it, put up the appearances of knowing all about her married life with Steve when in her own life they were still just boyfriend and girlfriend.\n\"So, how is Michele doing?\" Steve asked me.\nMichele? Oh, God, what does Michele have to do with this?\n\"Fine, just fine,\" I said, looking at Shannon. She raised an eyebrow --- she was just as curious about Michele being mentioned as I was.\n\"Well, we can't wait until next month,\" Steve said, sounding far too much like a pal and not at all like the guy who had beaten the crap out of me a few hours before and a universe away. \"Saint Anne's is really a pretty church. You're so lucky to have gotten it.\"\nA \"yes\" was about all I could manage. Michele and I were going to get married?\nI kept up the conversation for a few minutes more, slowly realizing that I was never going to get Shannon alone somewhere to talk. Though she might not like it, in this world she and Steve had become a pair, a joint person. They were married, and so they were together.\nI wondered what it would've been like to be in a world like that, where Shannon was no longer my friend by herself but just a co-acquaintance, half of SteveAndShannon.\nAs I started to become dizzy again and knew that Shannon would be moving onto her back now --- how many times did this woman turn in one night, anyway? --- I realized that I might not have to speculate about this possibility very long.\n\"Steve and I are supposed to get engaged this summer,\" Shannon had said to me a couple months ago.\n\"So you're engaged to be engaged, is that what you're trying to say?\"\n\"Right.\"\nI didn't know quite how to take it. I didn't have any claim to her myself, and her boyfriend certainly did. Even though she was my best friend, she had been dating Steve before we'd ever met.\n\"Well, congratulations,\" was what I finally said to her, trying to be a friend even though I wasn't sure how I was feeling just then.\n\"Thanks,\" she said, and gave me a hug. Before she pulled back, she whispered to me, \"You're still my best friend.\"\nI was so wrapped up in thinking that I had no time to stop Shannon's spin. She settled on her back and reality was torn away again.\nShe and I were sitting on my bed. It seemed like we were nothing more than friends.\n\"Okay, what's the catch?\" she asked. \"Are we married or single or having an affair or what?\"\n\"Check your purse,\" I told her.\nShe pulled her wallet out of her purse and showed me her driver's license --- it said she was single, a Miss Shannon Steinman. Her middle initial was incorrectly --- for me --- listed as G.\n\"Shannon, would you might telling me what the hell all this is about? Magazines?\"\nShe sat there for a moment, with her eyes closed and her brow wrinkled. Then she looked at me and nodded.\n\"You know the pens and magazines I keep giving to people?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Well, I don't buy those anywhere. I find them.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"All over my house. They just show up. You know how everybody else loses things like ball point pens and key chains? Well, I never do. I find them.\"\n\"And the magazines?\"\n\"Same way. Except most of them I can't get rid of, because they've got President Dukakis or President Dole on the cover. Some of them are just like our magazines, but they're addressed to Shannon and Steve or Shannon and Jeremy. I steam those ones off.\"\n\"How long has this been going on?\"\n\"A year or two,\" she said and started looking around the room. \"What's different about this world?\"\n\"I don't know. You seem a little different.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I don't know. You're not as...\" I paused.\n\"What?\"\n\"Well, I sort of... I think you're an attractive person, Shannon. You're usually really pretty. But for some reason, you're just not that cute in this world.\"\nShe got up and looked in a mirror, then turned around and frowned at me.\n\"I look exactly the same,\" she said. \"Too many pimples, like always. But nothing else is different.\"\nThere was a magazine --- okay, I'll admit it, I buy way too many of the damned things --- next to my bed in this reality, too. I picked it up.\n\"Maybe Newsweek can tell us what's different about this world,\" I said.\nI leafed through the magazine, with Shannon looking over my shoulder. Everything seemed the same --- it was exactly the same as the issue I had next to my bed at home.\nI flipped past a cover story about Yugoslavia. On the next page was an ad for body-building equipment. A large, sweaty football player-type was lifting a barbell.\n\"Oh, he's cute,\" I found myself saying. I immediately dropped the magazine.\n\"He's cute?\" Shannon asked me.\nHe was cute. I was actually attracted to him. And not to Shannon.\nWell, I knew what was different about that world, didn't I? And in it, Shannon really could never have been anything but a pal.\nShe moved from her back to her right side in one quick motion, and it all shifted again.\nThis time was different, somehow. I was outside for the first time, standing on a carefully tended lawn. I was by myself, and I realized where I was when I looked up and saw the headstone in front of me:\nSHANNON STEINMAN ALDEN\n1968-1992\nShe was my wife in this place, too. Flowers that I had no doubt just placed were sitting on top of her grave. The grass growing on the grave was very short --- I got the impression that Shannon hadn't been dead long.\nI felt dizzy, but this time the world didn't go away. Was it just the shock of contemplating what a world without Shannon would be like? The idea that I'd never again spend all those hours talking about insignificant details?\nI stood at the grave for a long time, wondering just how much Shannon meant to me. She had been a good friend in my life, but in these other lives she was always there. Sometimes she was with Steve, sometimes with me... sometimes even both at once. She was obviously someone I was capable of marrying and having children with.\nI waited for that reality to end, for the brief bout of dizziness to come and take me away, but it didn't. That was when I began wondering if something was terribly wrong. After all, Shannon had been alive in all the other dreamworlds we had visited. If she was dead here... could she be dead back in \"real life?\"\nI think I panicked then. I remember collapsing in front of Shannon's headstone and sobbing for a long time. Then, sometime later, I remember screaming.\nThe blackness shattered into pieces, each piece pulling me into a different world that was there and gone in an instant.\nLaying on the street, covered with a blanket of newspaper, trying to keep the night chill from giving me pneumonia.\nLaying next to Michele in bed, staring down at the wedding ring on my hand and wondering how I could have been trapped into marrying someone I didn't love.\nDancing with Shannon at our wedding.\nDancing with Shannon at her wedding.\nSlapping Michele in the heat of an argument we were having in our bedroom.\nSitting in front of a computer, writing computer code as I slowly bored myself to death.\nStanding in the middle of a forest fire, asking questions like any intrepid journalist should.\nLowering the french fries into the oil. (I knew I'd be working at McDonald's sometime, I chuckled to myself as the vision slipped away.)\nTelling Michele I loved her and lying.\nTelling Shannon I loved her. And not lying.\nKneeling at Shannon's grave again and crying.\nLooking at another grave, one with my own name on it.\nBlackness.\nI sat up in bed and screamed once. Shannon didn't move from her position on her side. I grabbed her shoulders and shook her.\nShe wasn't breathing when I started shaking her. But as soon as I touched her, she gasped and opened her eyes. I pulled her up and hugged her as her breathing started to calm back to normal.\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked her.\n\"I'm... fine,\" she said. \"I just blacked out. I don't know what happened.\"\n\"Me neither,\" I said. \"Me neither.\"\nWe sat there for a long time, not saying anything. We had both taken walks through each other's lives and would-be lives. We knew about what might have been --- or what might be --- between us. But in some of the worlds, she was with Steve. There was no One True Path. There were a series of possibilities, ones that had already passed us by.\nAfter a while, I finally pulled back and looked right into her eyes.\n\"Now what?\" I asked her.\n\"I don't know,\" she said. \"We'll see what happens.\"\nShe gave me a kiss on the cheek. It was completely innocent. It was also the first time she'd ever kissed me in this life.\n\"We sure will,\" I said later, as we tried to get back to sleep again --- this time in our own world. \"We sure will.\"\nJason Snell (jsnell@ocf.berkeley.edu) is the editor of the on-line magazine\nInterText and an assistant editor at MacUser magazine.

Is it a genre? Is it a passing fad? Is it a one-man literary wrecking squad?\nAnd, underneath all that, I've been wondering: should it matter?\nI'm not quite sure. Whatever William Gibson's Hugo, Nebula, and Campbell award-winning _Neuromancer_ started, it's become quite a special thing.\nGibson's cyberpunk trilogy (which, by the way, he seems to be finished with -- his next book is going to be about an alternate past where the Babbage Engine really works) consists of _Neuromancer_, _Count Zero_, and _Mona Lisa Overdrive_. It shows all of the signs of being its own literary form. In fact, one might even think that it's a pretty darn strict form, too.\nFor instance, each book works in a cycle of characters. This is most clear in _Count Zero_ and _Mona Lisa Overdrive_ -- there are various sets of characters which alternate each chapter, eventually coming together (or not coming together) at the end of the novel. The novels are set in a high-tech future dominated by cyberspace, a consensual hallucination, a virtual reality constructed out of all the computer systems in the world interacting with one another. But the world is controlled by international conglomerates, and voodoo-like intelligences run rampant through cyberspace. (Now, Gibson wasn't necessarily the first person to use these different elements, but he was the first to incorporate them all in this specific form.)\nThe question is, if this is what \"cyberpunk\" is all about, wouldn't any other \"cyberpunk\" novel be simply called a rip-off of William Gibson? Did Gibson start a genre, or are all the \"cyberpunk\" books and stories which followed _Neuromancer_ simply rip-offs?\nThe temptation to write about virtual realities, artificial intelligences, chip constructs, and other \"cyberpunk\" fixtures is great - it's logical that it would be that way. Some of the best Science Fiction comes from writers telling stories about the human condition from a different, fantastic vantage point. It's a wonderful way of \"coating\" the story -- viewing it from a different angle, so a reader lets down their defenses and doesn't view the novel with the same skeptical view which they take while watching the network news. And cyberpunk is ripe with allegorical potential.\nSay I use a virtual computer network in a novel I'm writing. Am I suddenly just \"ripping off\" William Gibson? What if I try to change it a little, don't use the name \"cyberspace\", make it a bit more interactive in some ways, less in others... what then? And what if I talk about artificial intelligences? Or ROM-copies of dead people's memory patterns?\nThis is the big question: is the founder of a genre creating new conventions, or is he just moving within his own work? Is it fair to say \"I'm writing a cyberpunk novel\", or should we be saying \"I'm writing a novel in the style of William Gibson\"? And should Gibson be flattered by the following which has sprung up around him, or should he feel that his work is being copied?\nSticky questions, all. And I bring this up because, as you've probably guessed by now, I've been trying to write a story which uses many of Gibson's conventions. My story has three characters which appear in a cycle, it has a virtual reality, it might have artificial intelligences and\/or ROM-constructs. Does this mean I'm writing a cyberpunk story? Will people see anything with these conventions and simply scream \"Cyberpunk!? I've Seen it all before!\" or, worse yet, \"Another Gibson rip-off\"?\nI hope not. I'd hope Science Fiction readers would be more open than that. But that doesn't seem to be the general pattern. Pigeonholing is the general pattern.\nBecause, you see, \"mainstream\" readers do that with Science Fiction in general. If I mention a book to a friend of mine, and let it slip that it's set in the future, or has aliens or robots or dinosaurs or anything like that in it, I'm as good as dead. Science fiction itself scares people off. People are scared of genres. So are people doubly scared of the sub-genre of \"cyberpunk\"? Quite probably.\nAnd it's all too bad -- because some damn good literature has been put out in the genre. Harlan Ellison fights the label \"Science Fiction\" for a good reason -- people won't take him seriously, people won't read him, if he's a genre writer. As it is, he goes in the literature section of the bookstore (some of the time, anyway) -- as he rightly deserves.\nBut Gibson belongs there, too. And so do a score of other Science Fiction novels -- not the 50's pulp-style which features aliens named Gloort, or robots named Zog, but sensitive, thought-provoking novels by Heinlein, Asimov, Sturgeon, Dick, Clarke, Le Guin, Tolkein, C.S. Lewis.\nAnd pigeonholing doesn't just cover individual works -- it can cover whole careers. The best example of this is Dan Simmons' novel Phases of Gravity. It has nothing \"Science Fictional\" in it at all. But Simmons has written Science Fiction in the past, and the book was published by Bantam as a Spectra Special Edition.\nI found it in the Science Fiction section. It was a beautiful novel, which I might not have ever read if it was in the mainstream novels. But that was where it belonged.\nCategorizing books and authors in general is bad enough -- but allowing yourself to be scared off from individual books by those generalizations is terrible. We shouldn't run from all westerns, or mysteries, or Science Fiction... or cyberpunk.\nI guess I'm safe in writing my story, because I can say \"well, it's cyberpunk, you know?\"\nBut, somehow, that scares me. I'd rather just say, \"this is a story I wrote about love, pain, and death. About human nature. It's an attempt at writing meaningful literature. It may be inept, it may just plain stink, but please read it and tell me what you think honestly.\"\nYet I know that, if the person I'm giving it to is a mainstream reader, he or she will read the first paragraph and mumble \"Uh-oh-- sci-fi\" to themselves. And if they're Science Fiction readers, chances are they'll say \"Uh-oh-- cyberpunk\" or, worse yet, \"Oh, no, another Gibson rip-off.\"\nYou see, it shouldn't matter whether \"cyberpunk\" is a genre, a following, or whatever. It shouldn't matter whether Simmons' Phases of Gravity is Science Fiction or not.\nBut it does, somehow -- and that's not fair. It prejudices readers, and it shouldn't.\nJason Snell is a sophomore at U.C.

The task force commander of the Meetpoint system patrol and the captain of this ship, the `Rhadon's Promise' waited within, sitting on the other side of the dimly illuminated table; a steward brought in silver-domed platters and crystal glasses. He watched her calmly, his eyes the dark color of tree bark, his fur reddish-brown. A dire wolf.\nThe commander misinterpreted her hesitation and waved a paw to the seat at the other end of the table. \"Please, be seated. You are quite safe as my guest here-- honor demands it.\"\nThe black-maned, calico-furred feline bard unslung her ancient shimmerlyre and set it down on the floor next to the table, then sat apprehensively, her tail swishing nervously. She wore her heavily jeweled ankle-length dress with a clumsiness that betrayed her inexperience with such fashions, turquoise squares alternating with emerald ones that matched her glittering green-gold eyes. Memories flitted uneasily within her mind.\nA deep green forest, darkened by twilight. Two small kittens cried out to the screeching carrion birds overhead as a yellow-eyed predator approached.\nA cloaked figure spoke to Ariaou, warning her that she would shortly receive bad news. The next day, a vidphone call told her that her brother had been murdered at King Ascenion's coronation.\nAn old grey-furred dire wolf faced down a golden unicorn, suited in swirling light that erupted in bolts of energy. He died, gunned down by a centaur behind him.\nAriaou blinked to see the steward filling her glass with a dark red wine of subtle aroma. The commander raised his glass in a silent toast, so she did the same to avoid looking distracted, barely noticing its rich and complex taste as she watched to see if the wolf noticed her discomfort.\nThe steward lifted the dome from the appetizer, skewered slivers of meat cooked in Ryme spices. Ariaou took one, watched the viewport as the distant winged form of the starliner `Princess's Favor' receded into a pinpoint of light and blazed into a thin line of fire as it accelerated away under main drive.\nThere was an uneasy pause after the meat was finished before the commander spoke. \"Permit me to introduce myself properly. I am Prince Rhadon Mordenkainen of Hellsgate, the Task Force Commander of the Second Hellsgate Fleet, which is currently assigned to Meetpoint patrol.\"\n\"Ariaou, a bard from Meetpoint,\" she replied. Curiosity overpowered her natural caution. \"If I might ask, why did you request my transfer from the `Princess's Favor'? I'm sure it couldn't solely be for the pleasure of my company at dinner.\"\nRhadon smiled, an eerie sight on a dire wolf. The steward removed the empty appetizer plate, substituted the first entree, an entire Elysian razor-tooth fish broiled and marinaded in redfruit juices, accompanied by a bottle of white wine. After the steward retreated to the kitchen, he said, voice quietly serious, \"You and several people were the last to see my older brother. Have you any news of what's befallen him?\"\nAriaou hesitated, wondering to herself about Rhadon's intent, then related the story of Gavar Mordenkainen, known better to her as Tarnkappe, and his attempt to wreak revenge upon her and the unicorn. She left out Sundancer's horn and certain other details, cautiously trying not to reveal more than necessary.\nThe commander's face remained expressionless, his sleek reddish-brown fur turned dark by the dim light of the stateroom. He nodded, finally. \"Thank you. So he has found a kind of peace.\"\nShe asked, warily, fearing to tread upon some hidden taboo, \"Is it true what he said, that a genetic disease haunts your line?\"\nThe prince chuckled humorlessly. \"The Curse of Lord Moreah. A sword hanging over each male descendant's head, which I have as yet been lucky enough not to feel. In the eyes of my people, Zephyr could not have killed my brother, for he was dead to them when his madness came, and even before that, his cruelty did not endear him to them. His exile was merely a public safety measure.\"\nAriaou nibbled on a piece of the fish as Prince Rhadon continued. \"It is for this reason that I named my ship `Rhadon's Promise'. Because of the curse, I expect to die much sooner than most of my people, but I also have greater power and responsibilities. I have sworn to overcome my limits and make Hellsgate a power to respect in this galaxy, to serve my people to the best of my abilities.\"\nThe steward replaced the fish with the second entree, a traditional dish of Hellsgate: delicately crusty circles of bread filled with spiced and minced jaghorse meat. Though it smelled mouthwatering, Ariaou noted that the food failed to receive more than minimum attention from Rhadon.\n\"There's little at Meetpoint to hold my interest,\" the commander said, a faraway look in his dark eyes. \"In truth, it's little more than an unneeded vacation, a political assignment of little strategic importance. But honor requires that I perform my duties, so Hellsgate shall be known as a world which keeps its obligations.\"\n\"Meetpoint Station's the political, cultural, and intellectual center of the galaxy,\" Ariaou replied noncommittally. \"It's important that it be protected by a joint force, so that no single government will control it.\"\n\"True. There are certain possibilities. Yet while we patrol, who would attack?\" The prince beckoned to the steward, who replaced the still half-full platter with a steaming bowl of trideer venison broth and a small plate of crusty finger-wide loaves which he dipped in the soup. \"And I fear that while time passes slowly on patrol, the madness may overcome me slowly, first paranoia, then a thirst for battle in any form that might present itself, finally unthinking bloodlust. Each minute that passes is a minute closer to death.\"\nAs he spoke, armored shutters moved quietly to close the viewport. A small beeping noise came from Rhadon's belt communicator. He answered it, listened to the voice coming from the other end. \"We'll be entering jump in sixteen minutes, Ariaou. At that time, you'll be transferred to a shuttle to Meetpoint. Matters have come up that require my attention.\"\nTime passed slowly while the stewards removed the dishes for safety. Ariaou took up her shimmerlyre and played an ancient aire to fill the time, its sweet strains calming her nerves and apparently soothing Rhadon's as well. The immortally perfect strings of the shimmerlyre called forth visions of moonlight upon the water, quiet forests about a lake.\nRhadon listened quietly. Though his body failed to express emotions, his liquid dark eyes shone with hidden sorrows and memories. As Ariaou's music drew to an end, he stood quietly and took her hand, then kissed it. \"My thanks. Your voice is lovely. Would that I could sing so well for you in turn.\"\nA strange sense of unreality swept the room, causing her vision to warp slightly; then, in a moment of sudden shifting, it ended. When it passed, Ariaou stood up and bade farewell to Rhadon.\n\"Until we meet again under better auspices, fare thee well,\" he replied.\nThe steward escorted her to the waiting shuttle, which lifted slowly from the starship and made its way to the inner edge of the Oort cloud where Meetpoint Station orbited silently. `Rhadon's Promise' shrank into a point of light that blazed away as it entered warpspace.\nMeetpoint Station approached steadily. Unlike the asteroid that was Ryme's `Quiet Reason', Meetpoint was built entirely of metal, a hundred spheres stacked one within another, each level a separate environment of its own. As the station grew nearer, Ariaou saw domes of various sizes dotting its surface, the exposed halves of auditoriums, stadiums, and concert halls.\nAriaou felt rather than saw the shuttle attach itself to one of the many docking ports. She disembarked, stepping into the crowded customs area of Meetpoint Starport F, then saw a familiar vulpine face waiting.\n\"Professor Karikhen!\" she called, waving.\n\"Ariaou!\" the red fox exclaimed, walking over to her. It seemed to the feline bard that the teacher walked with a slower gait, even for his age. Beneath short cocky ears, his green eyes shone as brightly as ever, taking note of the shimmerlyre that nestled between her shoulderblades, and the silvery case that protruded from her pouch. \"Well met again! I trust you found what you were looking for?\"\n\"Yes! It's a long story, but we've time,\" she replied, hugging him cordially, then picking up her bags from the collection area. They walked out of the starport section.\nKarikhen chuckled and led her down a blue-green striped corridor to his skimmer, directing its autopilot to take them to the Amaranth Memorial Library of Ancient Lore. \"I started some research when you sent me your letter,\" he explained. \"But we'll need to use the older hardcopies in the archives.\"\nThe skimmer merged into Meetpoint internal traffic, passing two cargo maglev barges ferrying plastic crates to shipping. Shielded from the outside wind and noise within the streamlined vehicle, Ariaou related the full story to Karikhen, leaving out no details, and showed him the horn of the fallen Sundancer resting within its silvery carrying case.\nThe aged teacher removed a small laser-sighted loup from his many-pocketed vest and examined the horn. \"A fascinating specimen, my dear feline. Am I correct in that you seek to know what virtues and secrets it might possess?\"\n\"More than that. With Sundancer gone, there's one less guardian in the galaxy. I feel as if I've inherited a mantle of responsibility.\" Ariaou looked out the windows of the skimmer, watched the enclosed parks whirl by the clear plastic-walled corridor. \"Why was I chosen? What must I do, and how should I do it?\"\nKarikhen nodded, more to himself than to the bard. \"Not very many people recognize that with power must come responsibility. Unleashed power quickly rages out of control and burns its user, and the innocents about him.\"\nThe aged fox looked up as the skimmer coasted to a stop. \"Perplexing. We've arrived at the Meetpoint Council building rather than the library.\"\nTwo uniformed guards arrived to escort them inside the cluster of domes that formed the center of government for the Meetpoint Station. They exchanged words with the professor, then opened the doors and led them up the stairs to the entrance. When Ariaou saw the professor walking calmly, she relaxed and followed with tail swaying anxiously. \"Do you know why we've been taken here?\"\n\"Very likely some sort of crisis,\" Karikhen replied, looking thoughtful and worried. His ears flickered. \"It's not uncommon that when a situation arises that must be dealt with quickly and efficiently, they call upon a few people and settle as much as they can discretely before bringing it up with the public.\"\n\"It seems rather underhanded to me,\" Ariaou said, tail lashing.\n\"Yes, it is. But sometimes it's necessary. And though often it can be beneficial, there'll always be those who oppose it.\"\nThe guards saluted and took up positions at the side of the door as they entered a large hemisphere. Circles of chairs lined the gently sloping floor, only the lowest filled with Meetpoint officials; a raised dais sat in the middle of the room with a speaker's podium on top. Large viewscreens hanging from the ceiling flashed starmaps crossed with dotted lines indicating the known starships' plotted paths.\n\"Welcome, Professor Karikhen, Ariaou. I am Zaharis, the current Meetpoint External Coordinator.\" the speaker said from the podium. He was a jade-green reptile standing upright, four thin spidery legs providing balance. His skeletal arms played deftly over the keyboard buried in the podium, causing lines of text and graphics to scroll over the viewscreens. \"I am sorry that we had to call you in so quickly, but as you'll see here, the situation demands a fast response.\"\nEach screen flickered, then shifted to a grainy deep-space view of many long, thin cylinders bound into a single unit. \"Our farthest patrol units discovered an ancient generation ship bound in-system at the far edge of the Oort cloud. A human ship.\"\nHe continued over the gasps of those assembled, \"Though its technology appears to be far below that which human civilization achieved at the time of Ragnarok, it still exceeds our own capabilities in many areas. Curiously, it does not seem to possess warpspace travel.\"\n\"Despite the passage of many milleniae since Ragnarok and the colonizing of our worlds, anti-human sentiment runs strong virtually everywhere, and for good reasons. No one wishes to see an age return in which humans dominated all other species-- and that is precisely what we may be seeing if these humans succeed in colonizing a world.\" The viewscreen returned to plotting the generation ship's predicted path through the Meetpoint system, a line that ended in an orbit around the fourth planet.\n\"Professor Karikhen, your judgement has proven sound on previous matters,\" Zaharis said. \"Who would you appoint as our representative to the human starship?\"\n\"Ariaou,\" he said without hesitating.\nThe feline bard squeaked in shock and turned to look at him. \"I've not the experience,\" she objected.\n\"I taught you. You will make a fine representative.\"\nZaharis raised a delicate second lid in a gesture much like a raised eyebrow. \"We may find that tested sooner than we thought. We sent them a radio signal several hours ago from the intercepting ship explaining our faster-than-light communication protocol. They're hailing us now. Ariaou, your decision?\"\nAriaou struggled to collect her wits, then stepped up to the podium next to Zaharis; Karikhen followed. The central viewscreen facing them flickered with a communication analysis report and the playback of the transmitted message. Mechanical distortion rendered the message tinny, the effects of slight incompatibilities in the equipment being used.\n\"This is the generation ship `Starfollower', crewed by six hundred people and carrying five hundred thousand passengers. We come in peace. We seek only a home for our people. We wish to speak with the denizens of this star system and begin negotiations. Repeat...\"\n\"Open communications,\" Ariaou decided.\nAlmost immediately, the screen switched to the picture of a silver-haired elderly woman with bright brown eyes, her features pure-bred Japanese. She wore a dark blue ship's uniform with a world-and-starship emblem on her right shoulder and Captain's rank insignia on her sleeves. Her manner was crisp, sharp, and her look calm and analytical. \"Greetings to you, Meetpoint Station! I am Captain Elaine Amaterasu of the EFS `Starfollower'. Have you the authority to negotiate with us?\"\nAriaou kept herself as diplomatic and neutral as possible, concealing distaste at the sight of Elaine's crewpeople's exposed bare skins. She brightly replied, \"Welcome, `Starfollower'! I am Ariaou, a bard of Meetpoint, the station's representative. How may we help you?\"\nAmaterasu's eyes widened as she took in the scene. \"You speak a dialect of our Common Language, yet there's not a true human among your numbers! How can this be? Are you alien species, part of a human federation?\"\nAriaou replied cautiously, \"From where and when did `Starfollower' depart? Much has changed since humans were dominant in the galaxy.\"\n\"We departed Noveaumonde, 5305 UDY, some time after our world joined the Commonwealth.\" Elaine looked reluctant to go on in further details.\nThe feline bard explained the story of the Owned People and the colony ships that escaped Ragnarok, aided by the Compassionate, to settle the Tangled Web nebula. \"Remarkable,\" Amaterasu exclaimed when she finished. \"Alone in an entire galaxy, so we created our own alien species. And yet our race died out, thousands of years ago, and only our gene-engineered creations survived us...\"\nThe feline bard sensed irritation in some of the members of the council at the implied belittlement of \"creations\". \"What do you seek here,\" she asked quickly. \"Why have you come to the Meetpoint System?\"\n\"We picked up your station's broadcasts as artificial signals, and homed in on them, hoping to obtain repairs and resupplying. Thousand-year voyages can be exhausting, you know.\" Elaine smiled wryly.\nAriaou remained suspicious. \"And what will you do then?\"\n\"We'll continue searching for an inhabitable world, far from your own youthful civilization, and try to start a colony.\"\nIt was plausible, reasonable even. But Ariaou suspected hidden motives behind Captain Elaine Amaterasu's actions. \"I'm sure you understand that we must take certain precautions. `Starfollower', please hold your position, and we'll send a courier to survey your ship's condition and deliver our decision.\"\n\"Understood. We await your messenger anxiously,\" Amaterasu replied. \"This is `Starfollower', over and out.\"\nThe viewscreen went silently dark, to be supplanted by an excited buzzing between the members of the council. Karikhen rested a reassuring paw on Ariaou's left shoulder as Zaharis hissed softly. \"Well done. But now we must send the messenger, and the courier. Whose life shall we risk? What if they lie?\"\n\"I'll go.\" Ariaou said quietly. \"Call a convocation of all the worlds. I'll give you my report from on board their ship.\"\nAt that moment, the screens blanked and filled with images of Rhadon, but a Rhadon far different from the wolf Ariaou knew, radiating authority. His eyes were flat, devoid of the warmth and depth of soul she'd seen a short while ago.\n\"I have declared a state of emergency. As empowered by our treaty, the Hellsgate Second Fleet assumes right of jurisdiction over the intruder. For your safety, our personnel on Meetpoint will provide police protection.\" Simultaneously, black-uniformed, mirror-helmeted soldiers stepped into the council chamber and held heavy plasma rifles at the ready.\nZaharis hissed, \"The Council has appointed its representative, and its representative has spoken. How can you justify speaking for Meetpoint?\" Behind him, the others present clamored and shouted.\nRhadon spoke, ignoring their protests, \"The Council is dissolved for the duration. Until this emergency is over, I appoint Secretary Duvan Gunnersson Meetpoint Director pro-tem.\" Betrayal! Shock ran down Ariaou's spine, causing her tail to lash angrily.\nPandemonium surged as Rhadon listed other orders that his soldiers would be enforcing, placing Meetpoint under martial law. As Rhadon's list of directives ended and the viewscreens went blank, Duvan walked up to the podium. He was a lightly built otter standing upright, his fur silver with age, anachronistic wire-rim spectacles dangling over his button nose.\nHe pressed a button, causing his visage to be spread across not only the screens in the chamber, but the ones throughout Meetpoint Station. His voice boomed over the public speakers, surprisingly loud and stentorian for such a slight person.\n\"As of three days ago, citizens, the Meetpoint system was invaded by human renegades. I regret the necessity for harsh action,\" he spoke. \"Yet in this time of crisis, we must take actions to protect ourselves. Our patrol fleet is already proceeding to the border of the Oort cloud, where they will intercept the enemy.\"\nDuvan Gunnersson's gaze turned dark, his spectacles glinting and his whiskers twitching angrily. \"Yet worse, we may have agents within our midst, who would work to help these aliens. For this reason, I am placing Professor Karikhen K'ris'fer under house arrest. All his current appointees' authority are revoked for the time being. Other members of the current government are being investigated at this moment.\"\nAriaou gasped at the otter's words. Professor Karikhen merely bowed his head acquiescingly as the soldiers came to escort him away, his tail limply dangling. Other council members snarled and growled unhappily, but in the face of the superior force of Rhadon's troops, they could do nothing.\nThe remainder of Duvan's directives passed in a blur. Halfway through Gunnersson's organization of a committee to study power usage, Ariaou walked out along with most of the remaining council members. Not having Karikhen's personal skimmer keys, she caught a passing bus and rode it to his home.\nAriaou looked out the windows of the bus to see Meetpoint's society continuing to operate normally. Yet here and there, crowds of people gathered around news channels that continued to broadcast reports of Rhadon's and Duvan's seizure of Meetpoint government by force. They protested angrily until dispersed by the black-uniformed soldiers and told to return to their homes.\nHologram street signs flashed by one by one, the bulkheads merging into a single blurry line. Ariaou watched them flicker as she remembered fondly her first visit to Karikhen's home. To fill in the time, to bring herself a measure of cheer, she took her shimmerlyre, drawing curious looks and sounds of admiration from the other passengers, and began playing a light song, putting her memories to verse. The notes sang forth, tinkling over each other in gay melody, each one perfectly formed.\nShe'd been a young feline, still kittenish in manners, when she was told she would be taking her journeyship education under the famed Professor K'ris'fer's supervision. Anxiously, she stepped up to the small, modest cluster of bubbles that formed his home, stood in front of the round oak door that formed its entrance, past a row of the Cherry Orchard residential area's namesakes. Fragrant pink blossoms drifted past her whiskers and nose as she rapped on the antique door knocker.\nThe door opened to reveal a mature red fox dressed in a kimono, his tail fluffy and white-tipped, his ears cocked rakishly. He invited her in, and before she had time to be nervous, she was holding a cup of mint tea and a plate of home baked sugar cookies, and telling the story of her life to Professor Karikhen. They became friends quickly, her bright music and youthful exuberance lending color to his days and his knowledge and wisdom guiding her through life.\nThree months later, it was to K'ris'fer's house that Ariaou ran, a red and gold edged envelope clutched in her paws, tears streaming down her whiskers. The surprised fox held her as she sobbed, then took the envelope from her unresisting grasp and read the message within. His gaze widened as he read the official letter. \"Killed by terrorists while en route here on the starliner `Queen's Ransom'? Alas, my poor Ariaou, twelve is far too young to lose your parents.\"\n\"They're gone forever, and they won't ever come back,\" the young girl wailed helplessly. Her eyes quivered with the promise of more tears.\nKarikhen held her chin up and directed her attention to the two coins he produced magically, suspended between three of his long fingers. \"Watch this.\"\nTempted by the promise of seeing something new, Ariaou rubbed her eyes to dry them, then focused her attention on Karikhen. The coins glittered in the light coming from an oval stained glass window, the obverse sides Meetpoint's logo of a compass rose inscribed around an open book, the reverse sides marked `Ten Marks' in a cursive, flowing script.\nWith a sweep of his free hand the fox produced a flower-patterned crimson and gold embroidered scarf, then whisked it past the coins. The young feline gasped to see the coins were gone.\n\"Vanished, yes, but not for long,\" the fox said, his bright green eyes laughing. \"Watch closely.. They're not in my hands. Nor my sleeves. Nor my feet, or tail.\" He batted lightly at Ariaou's paws. \"Nor my clothes, either, you impudent young kitten. They're right here, in fact.\" And with that, he pulled the mischevious coins out of the startled cat's ears.\nAriaou smiled a bit at that. Professor K'ris'fer dropped the coins into her paws. \"And so it is with your parents. They're not gone, totally, so long as you remember them. They live on in your mind. Remember the good times you had with them.\"\nHe spent the rest of the evening showing young Ariaou more of his magic tricks and sleight of hand, evoking some laughs and giggles, and in the morning, she left ready for the daily life of the academy again. With the passage of time, the hurt became a dull sadness. Whenever it threatened to blossom again, she took out the coins to remind herself of his advice.\nAriaou finished on an echoing musical phrase to the applause of the other passengers. Laughing at their pleas for more, she spun ballads from her memories of more innocent days of her childhood until the bus slowed to a stop at the Cherry Orchard stop.\nThe bard stepped off, looking about to see the familiar neighborhood. Yet an air of neglect surrounded the residential area, visible in the weed-overgrown gardens, the vacancies in smaller homes, and the condition of the streets. Overhead, the sky-blue roof continued to paint the illusion of spacious room, marred by a few cracks running along its length.\nTwo black-uniformed and mirror-helmeted guards stood outside Karikhen's house, rifles shouldered. They halted Ariaou before she could knock on the door and searched her clothes briskly. The first guard thumbed his communicator, requesting clearance from headquarters, then nodded to the second, who released Ariaou. \"Visitors are not permitted for more than two hours at a time,\" he cautioned.\nKarikhen opened the door in response to the first guard's knocking and guided Ariaou into his parlor. \"I'm so sorry that your appointment was cancelled, my child,\" Karikhen said apologetically. \"I'm sure you would have acquitted yourself well, had you been given the chance.\"\nAriaou smiled slightly. \"It's you who should feel slighted, Karikhen. You've been steadfastly trustworthy and loyal for years. But have you heard any news of what's happened?\"\n\"Indeed. While I may have been confined to my house, I've not been isolated from the information network. I've asked a few friends to keep me updated. The latest reports are disturbing.\" The fox frowned, thoughtfully looking at the notepad he carried.\nAriaou scanned the lines of type there while Karikhen continued, \"In fact, if the telemetry's correct, not only is Rhadon's fleet moving to intercept `Starfollower', but he's trying to provoke them into hostile action by buzzing the ship with his fighters. Rhadon has also declared that if they penetrate the defense periphery or return fire, he will consider himself free to use tactical nuclear weapons. Thus far, the generation ship continues to ignore all this.\"\n\"There must be a way I can get there in time...\" Ariaou looked frustratedly at the silver case and the horn that rested within, and at the shimmerlyre that rested on her shoulder.\nProfessor K'ris'fer appeared thoughtful. \"I did mention I had done some preliminary studies. Though I don't have access to the complete Meetpoint libraries or the hardcopies stored in the Amaranth archives, I turned up some ancient songs considered fictional that might apply. In fact...\" With a few keystrokes, his table computer produced hardcopy sheets of music.\n\"One of Maria Mask-Dancer's ballads! But I know all her songs, and I've never seen this one before..\"\n\"That's not surprising, considering it's proscribed to those below the rank of Master Musicians. A curious classification, since it deals with the fairly well known Battle of the Starshell Gap of five hundred years ago.\"\nSettling into a comfortably overstuffed chair, Karikhen continued, \"In those days, the nine-world empire of Lyonsfar was a feudal state beginning to emerge into an interstellar industrial age, its government becoming fragmented by the factional conflicts of its nobles. Then King Lyonnes VI died without children, barely three years after his wife was killed by an assassin. A civil war began. The two princes with the largest armadas crushed their opponents over a period of twelve years, eventually meeting at Starshell Gap. There, they unexplicably declared for the young Savinfar, and eventually made him the first of the Regents.\"\nAriaou skimmed through the pages, her eyes widening as she read. \"If this account is true, and all of Maria's songs were, then Savinfar was the last surviving descendant of Lyonnes's line! But how could Maria know that?\"\n\"Shortly after Lyonnes's wife Alira was assassinated, Maria visited and took on her semblance, so that she could give King Lyonnes comfort. Savinfar came from their union.\"\nKarikhen raised a hand to stop Ariaou's curious questions. \"Yet Maria's gift was entirely in casting a glamour over her listeners so that she would seem to be whatever she liked. How could she have made her way from the homeworld to the lightyears-distant fleets, when all civilian transport had been interdicted?\"\nThe feline bard returned to the beginning pages, recited softly the verses she found within. \"A griffon, bright red of wings and green of eyes. A magical winged beast carried her there in but a flicker of an eyelash.\"\n\"A Guardian, surely. According to Mask-Dancer, it sang like your Sundancer, and the magic of its songs caused distances to become like nothing. Maria tried to capture the sounds in this ballad, but came away with only a fragile imitation.\"\n\"Then the key's lost.\" Ariaou clenched her paws frustratedly, so close and yet so far from the music she needed. She yelped suddenly as a clawtip caused a drop of blood to well out of her palms.\nThe professor remained silent a while. \"There's a chance, if you remember Sundancer's song of travelling. Perhaps your own musical talent, aided by the shimmerlyre you carry and by the power of Sundancer's horn, can be directed by the Orpheus Sphere. You must go there and sing, until you come across the music that will take you where you wish to go. Or until you fail.\"\nThe feline bard nodded, sadly, seriously. \"I have to try.\"\nKarikhen rested his hands on Ariaou's shoulders. \"Good luck, my child.\"\nAriaou left with the aged fox's words in her mind, catching the bus without conscious thought. Again holographic street signs flashed past, barely noticed.\nThe Orpheus Sphere! Innocently glistening like a geode within, cut into a sonic mirror, each facet perfectly carved according to sophisticated mathematics. It would catch a singer's every inflections and reflect them back changed, hundreds and thousands of times. Singers hoping to find fame or fortune within its depth had been driven insane before. Or raised to new levels of genius.\nNo one had dared to venture into the Orpheus Sphere since Maria Mask-Dancer, those five centuries ago. Who would tamper with wild magic?\nWhen she got off from the bus, she found none of the regular security waiting at the airlock, nor the black-uniformed soldiers who had assumed their police and patrol duties. With heart pounding she stepped into the pressurized corridor that went the few meters from Meetpoint's outermost shell to the Orpheus Sphere. She programmed the controls to initiate the warmup sequence in two minutes, strapped on the bootjets, and stepped in.\nAriaou floated into the middle of the geode, watching light glint from the faraway facets. The sounds of her bootjets faded away softly as she stretched quietly in the exact center, floating in zero gravity. Soon complete silence reigned, punctuated only by the sounds of the feline's gentle breathing.\nDrawing on her recollection of Maria Mask-Dancer's ballad, Ariaou took her shimmerlyre, the motion setting her into a slow spin with her tail following behind. Her paws stroked the strings, letting loose a quiet tinkling stream of notes that wove over themselves in the opening chords. Hidden lights responded to the music, flickering in rhythmic patterns.\nSlowly, gradually Ariaou spun the image of the far distant towers of Lyonsfar's capital city, Lyonhelm. The earliest sunrise crept along the outermost walls, turning the sky midnight blue, golden notes shivering in midair in complex echoes. A city awoke slowly, the hubbub of the people rising out of subtle dissonances.\nAriaou sang, her voice purring with a soft resonance that became an underlying harmony, evoking the slight winged figure of the Mask-Dancer. Maria stood atop the tallest spire of the palace, her long white hair falling over her silvery cloak that tinkled and flowed about her ankles, her bright grey eyes looking out onto the city below; her translucent butterfly blue-gold wings spread to catch the wind. Rising daylight shimmered about her feet, and cool breezes ruffled her cloak.\nThe feline bard sang Maria's plea, the ancient dialect of Lyonsfar stately and melodious from her tongue. In answer to Maria's call, a proud gryphon answered, his wings shading from sunlight-orange to flame-red, and cried out in a voice of iron and copper. The sun silhouetted them, a sylph beckoning to the half-lion, half-eagle griffin, begging for assistance that she might stop a senseless civil war, and prevent millions from dying needlessly.\nAt last the gryphon bowed his head, lowered his wings that Maria might ride. He sang a majestic song, like a whalesong or a rainbow made material in steel and glass as he swept his wings and leapt aloft into the air.\nLight glinted off the curve of the Orpheus Sphere, the sheer energy of Ariaou's version of the gryphon's theme multiplying and cascading. She drew upon her memories of Sundancer so long ago in the golden forest, weaving his travel theme with Maria Mask-Dancer's ballad and seeking out the music and repeated phrases that seemed right to her. Waves of sound battered against her body from all directions.\nWith each new height, Sundancer's horn glowed with greater light, shining like a miniature sun from the necklace that dangled about her neck. Ariaou quested for the key that would open its powers, then found it. Time suspended as her voice, her shimmerlyre, the very walls of the Orpheus Sphere all united in a single pure note that broke down walls of space and time.\nReality cracked in a multitude of rainbows and Ariaou stepped through to someplace else.\nShe arrived in confusion. The bridge of the `Starfollower' shone red under the emergency lights, crewmembers scanning their displays intently or running back and forth on the catwalks high above. Viewscreens flickered with battle graphics, plotting the incoming fighter squadrons. As Ariaou glanced about, the control board next to her erupted into flames.\nThe feline jumped back from the fire, falling against Captain Elaine Amaterasu who surprisedly put a hand to her officer's sidearm. Other crewmembers started, turning to watch the strange cat and their captain.\n\"You're the negotiator we spoke with,\" Elaine exclaimed. \"How did you get onto the bridge? Why did your ships open fire?\"\n\"They've attacked already?\" Ariaou asked. She picked herself up and straightened her clothes out. The horn had fallen to the floor, its light dwindling back to a length of cool moonlight; this she replaced in its silver carrying case.\n\"Didn't you know?\" Amaterasu studied the feline's expression, then sighed. \"We were half a light-minute from the inner edge of the Oort cloud when their fighters started buzzing us, then they started firing about half an hour ago. Now they're threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons on us if we don't back off.\"\nSecurity guards approached, their function obvious in their armored uniforms and their heavier guns. The captain came up to Elaine and saluted, his complexion darker and his hair pure black. \"Shall we remove this... alien saboteur from the bridge?\"\n\"No, Captain Amaterasu! You're being attacked by a hostile faction that's taken over Meetpoint Station. It's their forces that are trying to draw you into battle. None of this is our fault; we would have dealt with you in good faith!\" Ariaou's bright green-gold eyes pleaded with Elaine for time, and for consideration of her words.\nElaine studied the feline bard for a timeless moment, while her crew returned to their stations, while `Starfollower' shuddered under the impact of Rhadon's missiles. Her own dark brown eyes glinted. \"I wish I could trust you, but we've been betrayed by nonhumans too many times. We trust no one. Take her to confinement; we'll continue as I directed and trust to our defenses.\"\nA massive jolt shook the ship, causing the crew, their captain, and Ariaou herself to stumble and fall. Viewscreens began blinking on and off, some distorting to static, others showing readouts on the damage inflicted to `Starfollower's' systems. \"That was a five megaton nuclear burst, five hundred kilometers off,\" a red-haired officer shouted. \"The EMP scrambled our drive controls. They shut off automatically, or else we'd all be smeared against the walls like jelly!\"\nAll business now, Elaine snapped, \"What about our other systems? I want a damage report, section by section. Main gun sections, prepare to open fire on the enemy fighters.\"\nAriaou picked herself up, thought fast as she saw the guards doing likewise. With nowhere to run, she controlled her rising panic and took up her shimmerlyre, and began to sing what came to mind.\nShe did not know the ancient words to the lullabye that she sang, nor the sweet, soft music that underlay them. It was the same one that she'd sung on Ryme, when first she took up the lyre, her paws flying to patterns of strings remembered though she'd never studied it, the same one that had had the power to bring a ghost to forget its vengeance. Its beauty was fey in a way that no modern music could match.\nIndecipherable though its words might be, the lullabye's effect on Elaine's crew was instant. Through the entire generation ship, within each bulkheaded area, the ethereal music cut short the damage reports and panicked calls for assistance. The security guards hesitated, looking to the captain for their directions.\nCaptain Elaine Amaterasu listened also; with a small hand motion, she signalled the guards to return to their posts. Her dark brown eyes glistened with memories suddenly recalled by Ariaou's evocative song, her features losing years as she relaxed her customary frown. She whispered to herself, though Ariaou's sensitive ears caught it, \"It's beautiful... The music of my ancestors... Yet I thought it'd been lost long ago, when my parents died.\"\nAriaou gained confidence as she held the crew's attention spellbound with her music. Reaching the end of the lullabye, she improvised, drawing upon her musical history to spin the old songs of reunion. Meant for the colony worlds rising to interstellar travel, to bind them together despite their mutual distrust and fear of outsiders, she improvised instead a message of camaraderie between species. The crew of the `Starfollower' listened, held captive by her voice.\nAriaou spoke to them of their differences, a void that, try as it might, could not be eliminated. Though to them, her fur and her feline ancestry might be repulsively different, their own bare skins and their blunt teeth seemed to her things to be pitied. Beneath exterior appearance, she sang, in sweet verse and soft music, there rested a being worth knowing, respecting, befriending. And she spoke to them of their similarities, of value placed on beauty and truth, honor and creativity.\nFinally, exhausted, Ariaou rested her shimmerlyre in the crook of one arm and bowed her head, waiting to accept what decision Captain Elaine Amaterasu might make. A moment passed; another nuclear explosion shook the ship, though not so hard. With stunned expressions, the crewmembers returned to their duties, and the damage reports began pouring in again.\n\"You sing beautifully, Ariaou,\" Elaine said at last. \"And your message is one to which we might open our hearts. I...we... had forgotten that things could be better, that there might be times when we could... trust others...\"\n\"What if it's a trap?\" a crewman asked; young, bold, fair of hair and brash. \"If this cat is really some kind of saboteur?\"\nCaptain Amaterasu replied, \"Trusting has to begin somewhere, Lieutenant. But, tell me, even were we to turn aside, how do you plan to force the attackers to hold their fire?\"\n\"Let me speak with them,\" Ariaou replied. Drawing upon her knowledge of Tangled Web protocol, she suggested, \"Request a ceasefire, under the Mark of the Lion Humbled, and they'll answer. If they don't, they become outlaws, to be hunted by all the nebula's forces.\"\nThe captain and her communications officer exchanged words. The message was sent. It took moments for the reply to arrive, an enigmatic message: Ariaou. You have slain one wolf with your powers of song; you shall not have another. Leave behind your instruments, and I shall send a courier to take you to where we first met. With respect, Rhadon.\nAriaou stood stunned for a moment while Elaine considered the message. \"I do hope you weren't counting on your powers of sweet song alone to carry the day, my dear feline,\" she commented drily. \"He doesn't sound friendly to me.\"\n\"Perhaps there's a way...\" the bard replied. \"I'd rather chance a face-to-face meeting, even if my life was at stake, than let your lives and theirs be risked in battle.\"\nThe minutes passed slowly in a dead silence. Rhadon's fighters ceased to sally forth in their attempts to goad `Starfollower' into returning fire. The dotted paths on the bridge's viewscreens slowly approached each other, the single massive generation ship moving directly toward a horde of far smaller cruisers and destroyers. `Rhadon's Promise' launched a lone shuttle on a high-acceleration path.\nThe screen flashed the estimated arrival time of the shuttle, flickering from ten minutes to nine, then eight. Captain Elaine barked orders as her crew set about repairing the damage done by the nuclear bursts, directing repair crews to the engine control conduits. \"Until those're fixed,\" she explained to Ariaou, \"We'll be unable to navigate or even brake our ship. There's no telling how long it'll take to repair them. If you fail, we'll be forced to use all our weapons systems to defend ourselves, and strike back at your worlds.\"\n\"And no matter how long it takes, should it come to that, our forces would certainly destroy your own ship, and with it, the only remaining humans in this galaxy.\" Ariaou sighed. \"This is our only chance.\"\nThe courier made fast to a sally port that adjusted its grapple to seal tightly about the shuttle's airlock, compensating for the incompatible docking systems. Ariaou entrusted her shimmerlyre to Elaine's custody and bid farewell to her. The captain of the generation ship saluted back as the feline stepped in with the assistance of the waiting lupine crewman. The shuttle's airlock irised close as she strapped herself into the high-acceleration couch.\n\"We'll reach the task force in nine minutes,\" the crewman commented as he operated the controls. \"Captain Rhadon's ordered the fleet to remain at their current distance from the enemy ship.\"\nThe courier ship separated from the `Starfollower' and boosted away at high speed, its anti-matter engines producing a long stream of charged hydrogen ions accelerated through its drive. Their acceleration reached the maximum the artificial gravity field could negate, pressing Ariaou back onto the couch; that weight reminded her uncomfortably that her own shimmerlyre had been left behind. The forward viewscreen showed a rapidly approaching swarm of bees that grew into long, sleekly deadly warships.\nAriaou's pilot reversed the courier at the midpoint of their flight, using the engines to brake the tiny ship's velocity. They coasted by the missile destroyers that led Rhadon's task force and their fighter escorts, each showing up only as a blip on the viewscreen, their positions delayed by the speed of light. The path of the shuttle converged precisely, as if drawn by a magnet, onto the flagship.\n`Rhadon's Promise' loomed large out of the shadows of space, its sudden tines of gleaming mirror-bright metal punctuated by weapons clusters. The pilot controlled the courier deftly, using the compressed hydrogen jets to snuggle the ship into one of the recessed docking bays without the assistance of the cruiser's grapples. He grinned, his fangs clean white, proud of a job well done.\nTwo waiting guards, dressed in black uniforms but without the mirrored helmets of those that had taken Meetpoint, escorted Ariaou out of the courier and onto a waiting maglev cart; one was a silver-furred vulpine, the other a mink still in winter white. To her questions, they only replied, \"Rhadon is expecting you in his stateroom.\"\nWith a sense of deja vu, Ariaou stood once again in front of Rhadon's stateroom. She stepped forward hesitantly, and confronted the wolf that stood at the other side of the room.\nPrince Rhadon Mordenkainen looked terrible. His eyes burned, their once dark brown irises now almost entirely black pupils, and his reddish brown fur was unkempt from lack of grooming and from the sweat of his mental exertions. He tensed, almost crouched over, his tight commander's uniform betraying his battle stance, and to Ariaou's keen sight, his fatigue.\n\"Who would have thought that my betrayer would be one with the voice of an angel?\" he asked, rhetorically, his gaze burning into Ariaou's eyes. The feline restrained herself from quailing, showing visible fear, but she felt sure that the wolf's heightened senses could smell her distress. \"It might be better if I were simply to slay you now, eliminating a threat; yet by the Mark of the Humbled Lion, I am forced to guest you honorably.\"\nAriaou raised her paws in a display of appeasement. \"How could I hurt you? I seek only to speak with you, to arrange a peace so that no lives need be lost.\"\nRhadon grinned wolfishly, no humour visible in his cruelly gleaming fangs. Determination ran like steel beneath his voice, still eerily normal, honed to an aristocrat's manners. \"You yourself are a weapon, innocent though you may seem. Were I to give in, to permit these human invaders to survive, then in a generation's time, or in many's, it does not matter, this nebula would once again be enslaved to their whims. I shall not permit this to happen, and so they must be destroyed, before they can even begin.\"\nThe feline approached slowly, paws still outstretched in a show of defenselessness. She thought fast, remembering their conversation only hours gone by, yet an eternity ago. \"You live for honor, for service to your people. Yet you've betrayed these both.\"\n\"How is that?\" Rhadon looked confused, his rock-steady countenance beginning to crack.\n\"You betrayed your honor when you violated Meetpoint's sanctity, capturing it by force. And you betrayed your people, for they will be forced to answer for your actions, for every life that was lost in your actions.\" Ariaou's gaze was steady as she took one of Rhadon's trembling paws in her own. Rhadon's muscles tautened, his muzzle quivering.\n\"No,\" the wolf snarled, extending long sharp claws. \"You are trying to confuse me with your words. I was foolish to permit you to speak, an error that I shall remedy with your death. Then I shall direct my ships to destroy the humans quickly and efficiently.\"\n\"I'm sorry, Rhadon... But I have to protect Meetpoint, and the humans, for they're innocent of any crimes of history. Any way that I can.\" Ariaou reached down to open the silvery case that held Sundancer's horn, revealing the long shaft of cool moonlight. Rhadon's eyes narrowed at the apparent weapon; he swiped at the case, sending it flying from her hands, the horn arcing through air in a perfect parabola to clatter on the floor.\nThe feline dived after it, scooped it up in her paws like a dagger. The wolf leapt after her, his black eyes swallowing her up in their depths as he closed in, his legs propelling him across the room efficiently. Time slowed as Ariaou met his gaze fiercely, tensing her muscles. She snarled, exposing her own even, shining white fangs.\nThey met in a suspended moment of glittering claws and flashing horn.\nAriaou fell in a heap of fur. She gradually became aware of a warm wetness from her right side, looked down to see blood welling slowly, then back behind her, where Rhadon struggled upright. The moonlight spire of Sundancer's horn gleamed from his side, barely half its length visible; she vaguely remembered it being ripped out of her paws by the force of his passing. Weaponless, instrumentless, Ariaou waited calmly for whatever fate might bring.\nShe was, consequently, surprised when he spoke in a completely calm voice. \"My apologies. I'm afraid I have not been... quite myself.\" Rhadon removed the horn from his side, tearing strips of cloth from his uniform to bandage his wound and Ariaou's. \"Honor demands that I atone for the shame and injustice I have caused. I am at your service.\"\nAriaou sighed, too tired to feel exuberance. \"Let's call your fleet home to Meetpoint, and invite `Starfollower' to parley.\" She reclined into Rhadon's supporting arms and fell asleep.\nShe awoke several days later in a comfortable old-fashioned wooden bed later to Professor Karikhen K'ris'fer's smiling vulpine face. Captain Elaine Amaterasu stood nearby, carrying her shimmerlyre, and Prince Rhadon Mordenkainen cradled Sundancer's horn in his arms. They exchanged wary smiles. \"It's over,\" Karikhen exclaimed happily. \"We've signed a treaty with the humans.\"\nElaine nodded. A rare smile graced her aged features. \"Many years may pass before humans can be accepted into your society, but we'll bide our time. Until then, Meetpoint Academy's agreed to let us settle an uninhabited moon of the system, and will send students to study with us on a foreign exchange basis. We'll do likewise, and eventually our cultures will be able to intermingle freely.\"\n\"And what of you, Karikhen?\" Ariaou asked. She sat up partway, stopping as a twinge ran through her side.\n\"You're an amazing bard,\" the fox said with a laugh. \"I was cleared of all charges the moment Rhadon rescinded all his orders, but the government was forced to make a public statement because of that song of yours you made up while in the bus. I'm a popular figure now! And you're going to be seeing some royalties soon, I believe...\" He shook his head disbelievingly.\nThe feline smiled tiredly. \"That's good... And you, Rhadon? What has your homeworld to say of all this?\"\nRhadon reached out with a paw, touched Ariaou's. His eyes glinted softly, once again warm brown. \"Officially, I no longer exist, having fallen under the Curse of Lord Moreah, even though you healed me of that; I've been discharged from my duties and disowned by my family. Unofficially? I plan to study here at Meetpoint, now that I have more time ahead of me. And I'd like to get to know a certain bard better.\"\nConrad Wong is a CS student at U. C.

We found ourselves just a little away from the church at Montmartre, right beside the little funicular in fact. It was a beautiful day, sometime in early spring I'd say by the smell of it, and the rush of good living air gave us all pause to take a breath. Looking about we saw very few people, I suppose it was early morning for them and most of them were still ensconced in their beds. I repressed a small surge of what I suppose was jealousy, thinking of these little, simple people who could attain comfort and peace so simply. Dave suggested that we go into the church, as there might be some people in there at an early morning service, so we did. The place was deserted of course and we all laughed at Dave. Jane gave him a punch in the kidneys which we all thought was funny too. They're bosom buddies really, and have worked together on many occasions in the past, doing some honestly breathtaking tasks. Their commitment is second to none. So we wandered around the church for a while. I found the tombs very interesting and quite thrilling -- lovely cool marble slabs, emotionally and respectably engraved with paeans about the late lamented. Looking at some of the names and reading some of the stones I almost felt I had known these people personally. Dave had gone off snuffling around the pews in one of the darker areas, most likely he was looking for bugs. A bit of an entomologist, our Dave, he's especially fascinated by parasites, holds them in great regard altogether, says they do a lot of very useful work that might otherwise go undone and unnoticed, to everybody's detriment. Or detritus. Sorry about that, I have always found puns quite irresistible, though many have said that they are no sign of wit.\nAs I rested against one of the sarcophagi, Simon came stalking along, chewing on something black and nasty-looking. It turned out that he been poking about up around the bell tower and had caught a bat. This was the black object he was currently ingesting. I declined his offer of entrails and pointed him in the direction of the sacristy where he could get some wine to slake his thirst. He has told me in the past that bats make him very thirsty. I watched him go, tall and very very thin, like a strange piece of very old parchment stretched over a random collection of sticks. He stopped to talk to Jane, who was etching bad runes into the back of the pews, and offered her some bat. She turned and stabbed him in the thigh with her stylus, Simon's grunt causing Dave to look up and laugh. She ran over to him and kicked him in the gut. I said nothing. I had often thought that she might have a soft spot for me, seeing as she doesn't kick the shit out of me very often, but now I think it's because of some sort of respect or perhaps even fear that she tends to keep her distance. A lot of people are afraid of me, even those whom I could call my friends. I'm not affected by that any more, I suppose it comes with the job. Simon came back from the direction of the sacristy, earnestly chugging a bottle of french altar wine. As an afterthought, he crunched up the bottle also, then belched resoundingly. A small spatter of blood appeared on a pillar just beside his head, but it disappeared quickly. I called all of them over to me, and opened a door.\nAnd stepped into Beirut. Jane looked around, her eyes shining. She rushed over to hug me, and kissed my face. As she scrambled around the rubble, giggling, Dave began to look for rats. I found a small dog with a broken back whimpering behind a rock. Its coat was scorched and trampled and it drooled blood-flecked saliva. I stood on its head and it died. Simon came over to me and asked if he could eat it. I shrugged, but Dave called over that this it was probably not a very good idea to eat it raw. Disappointed, Simon sat on a rock and chucked pebbles at nearby burnt-out vehicles. Behind me I heard a scuffle, so I turned and looked up at the roof of a ruined store. There was a young person there, of unknowable sex, perhaps none at all, for it appeared but a child. It was wearing combat fatigues and carried a small sub-machine gun. As I watched the childs eyes, seeing its doom, there was a crack behind me and the childs forehead blossomed scarlet. Jane had shot it with a small handgun she had discovered in the wreck of a nearby house. Simon cringed visibly as she shouted \"Casualty of War!\" to the sky. We had all seen this much too often and quite frankly we were all pretty bored with it, but I suppose selfexpression is an important thing too, and it may be rarer than life. I walked up the broken edge of the shop to where the body lay on the roof. Its eyes were still open and it was twitching visibly, raising little ripples in its sauce of blood. I sighed and touched its head to shut its eyes and the child died. Looking down from the roof I saw that Jane was beating Dave quite severely about the head with the end of the handgun and I decided it was time to go. I opened a door and pushed them in.\nWe fell out in Moghadishu. It was hot, hot, summer time. The earth was baking and the air had been broiled many times over. All sounds were muted by the heat, except for the crack of superheated stones, the carrion razor buzz of the flies, and the weak whimpering cries of the people. I sat down in the shade of a rickety shanty hut, took out a battered cigarette and lit it. Jane joined me and asked for a cigarette too. Small rivulets of perspiration made clear tracks on her dust-smeared temples, changed course as she threw her head back to exhale. She was watching the other two intently as they prowled and stalked their way around the fallen down huts and bloated and attenuated children and adults. Simon appeared to be nodding in a satisfied sort of way while Dave prowled and frowned and pointed, saying inaudible things to Simon who would rapidly nod and smile. A woman went by, bent under the weight of small sack of maize. I watched Simon approach her and offer to carry the sack to her dwelling, a brown shambles maybe thirty yards away. She just dropped the bag, too fatigued and weak to do anything else. Dave put out his hand to steady her and she straightened and even smiled slightly. Simon walked off ahead toward her hut, beckoning to follow. I glanced at Jane who was shaking her head slightly. She had seen this particular trick before too. I caught her eye and she glanced quickly away, possibly a bit ashamed of her own excesses which we had all seen just recently. The woman couldn't keep pace with Simon, who was now just approaching her shanty. He came to the sagging entrance, paused, then continued past. The woman uttered a small wail and attempted to speed up her pace to catch Simon and regain her sack of precious grain. Simon walked faster, and the woman began to falter. She appeared to be getting progressively weaker with every step, and her flesh appear to melt from off her bones. After eleven steps, she collapsed, a brown wrinkled leather bag of dry bones like sticks of driftwood. Again I walked out into the searing heat and approached the woman. I knelt to turn her head and looked into her unseeing eyes. I felt her die then. Jane had come over behind me and was staring with slitted eyes and pursed lips at a point over my shoulder. Her jaw muscles moved, clenched, moved, clenched. I looked around to see Simon eating the maize from the bag. Dave was nearby playing with some flies. It was definitely time to go. I opened a door.\nAnd stepped out into sunshine and a warm breeze coming in off the sea. We stood on a slightly dried but still well manicured lawn in front of a large very white building with lots of windows. A small sign on my left said something in Greek. Dave looked around and sniffed, then headed for a set of large glass doors. We all entered the building which contained people wearing blue and white clothes and apparently walking aimlessly about. The smell of the building was very familiar to me, I had been in a lot of these places over the years. I didn't recognize this particular one, but I do tend to travel a lot, and faces and places always blur in my memory. We all followed Dave around green and white corridors, through arches and rooms and places lined with beds to a large white door. Above it, a sign said something in Greek. We pushed in and we were in a big white room with beds in it. There were people in the beds and people walking around. The people walking around wore great big plastic bags and walked really slowly. Simon laughed very loud and Jane punched him in the kidneys and we all laughed. I sat down on an unused bed and played with some metal instruments I found in a metal bowl. Some were very sharp and some were very funny shapes, all of them were glistening and beautifully, beautifully sterile. Impressed, I gave a small knife to Jane, who looked at it and smiled. Then she buried it in Simon's left buttock, and we howled with laughter to see Simon hopping around with the little knife wobbling about. Dave shouted at us to shut up as he was trying to talk to the people in the beds. After a while he began shouting at them and became angry. He began to swear and kick things and search about, eventually finding a smaller room. He went inside and we waited. After a couple of seconds bottles and flasks and glasses came flying out of the little room to smash on the floor of the big room. We could hear Dave shouting over the noise of breaking glass and splintering plastic and were we glad that he was enjoying himself so much. He's usually pretty taciturn and reserved. When he had broken everything and had come over, panting, to where the rest of us were sitting (except for Simon of course, who's arse was very sore) I decided that the holiday was over and now it was time to go to work. We couldn't spend all eternity mucking around. So I opened a door.\nJane started the job, with a little support from Simon. When events started moving under their own power, I put Simon in a more involved role, allowing him to spread out his influence and to produce basic raw material for Dave. Jane of course had put together a good bit of produce for Dave and myself at this stage so I congratulated her and told her to rest until the Grand Finale. I started Dave into fulltime involvement with the project while I myself cleared up loose ends which gave the two lads extra working space. They certainly make a great team: while Simon is slow and very steady in his methods, Dave is rash and brilliant and can be completely unstoppable. I weaved in and out, here and there, mopping up here, cleaning up a problem there, helping out with the backlog and eventually accounting for all the important bits that come in at the end. Generally I don't get much praise for this, since my involvement is quite fragmented, but I'm there at every stage, and I hate to think what would happen if I was ever excluded from the team. I told the two lads to rest up while I chopped off all the rough edges and put a few of my own finishing touches to the thing. Then we all took a rest for a while, to get ready for the End Ceremony. Then I opened a door.\nAnd we arrived in a small town in West Connemara, just beside a tiny train station. When we went inside, we found that it had been gutted by fire in the recent troubles, but the four fireproof rentable lockers were still there. Inside, each of us had stashed our ceremonial garments which we used to parade around at the completion and wind-up of a project. I personally think it's all a bit old fashioned, but our immediate bosses say it's important to impress the clients. So as we dressed in our regalia of office, I opened a door, and four horses came through. I think this is very old-fashioned too, but who can change tradition?\nohurley@dsg.cs.tcd.ie\nQuanta is Copyright(c)1994 Daniel K.

She left the warm body sleeping in her bed and made her way to the kitchen. Spring is cold in Minneapolis. Making breakfast, she considered going back to bed. But she decided that she didn't want to be more than half an hour late to her first day on the new job.\nShe found Kelly Peterson's office behind mirror glass on the seventeenth floor of the new Excon building on Nicollet, and walked in.\n\"You're late.\" Kelly, petite and brown-eyed with a delicate face, wore artificially long straight hair in the current fashion. Jackie sat down and put her boots on the desk.\n\"Skip that. There's an automatic farm on the fritz that I'm supposed to fix,\" Jackie said.\nThe air between them began to freeze.\n\"You seem to forget which of us is the boss,\" Kelly said. \"You refused to take a Political Reliability Exam. You refused to give us blood and urine samples, and access to your health records. You're not on time. These are all conditions of employment. How do you expect to get along with your superiors?\"\n\"Go jump in a lake.\" Jackie rubbed the heels of her boots together, leaving fragments of dirt on the tabletop. \"I'd just as soon quit now as next week. But you need an experienced systems engineer, and that's why I'm getting paid twice what you are. Not that money means anything anymore. Besides, I'm insulted. No scientist, engineer, or technician worth his or her salt will give you a urine sample. No one's even dared ask me since I was fresh out of the Institute. I refused then.\"\n\"Here at Excon, we try to maintain higher employee standards than are unfortunately prevalent elsewhere.\"\n\"So fire me. Let's see you beukies, I mean bureaucrats, fix a leaky faucett.\"\n\"We have some very competent personnel who are willing top take PRE's and give us urine samples,\" Kelly muttered, surrendering.\n\"Sure.\" War over. Jackie swung her legs off the table and got up. \"Where's my terminal?\"\n\"Actually, management feels you probably ought to have a look at the farm in person. There's a van in the basement garage. I'll show you.\"\n`Management probably ought to have a look at itself,' Jackie thought as she followed.\nThe garage was dim and smoky. The van was enormous. A shirtless man with a well-defined chest and a bristling mustache was loading crates of equipment into the back.\n\"This is Mark Eckert, an automation tech who will be coming with us. Mark, this is Jackie Allan,\" Kelly introduced.\n\"I know Mark. Hi.\" (Jackie felt that Mark had the most beautiful eyelashes she had ever seen on a man.)\n\"Hi Jackie.\"\n\"You said - us?\" Jackie turned to Kelly.\n\"Uh, I was told to come along.\"\nJackie gave her a hard look without saying anything. Then she climbed in one of the side doors of the van.\nAutomation up front; a manual driver's seat just in case; methanol engine; living quarters; lab space with terminals; and storage space in the back.\nMark climbed in with a four foot satellite dish.\n\"Hey, Jackie, what's with the beukie coming along?\"\nShe reached out and flipped on a terminal.\n\"I'm not sure. Excon's been security-fanatic ever since people stopped them from putting microwave receivers on the Greenland icecap. You remember that?\"\n\"Microwave power beamed down from the solar arrays in space? But I thought those things were in the Pacific ocean.\"\n\"They are.\" Jackie was watching her screen. She'd found her login and started exploring while they talked. \"Some beukie originally wanted to put them on the glaciers. They didn't realize the conversion heat would eventually melt the glaciers, reduce the earth's surface albedo, and give global warming an extra oomph.\" She suspended a throat mike around her neck.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"They were stopped. Mortal blow to the collective ego of top management. So now Excon recruits weak-willed people who give urine samples. I think Kelly's supposed to keep an eye on us.\"\nA door slammed up front. The twitch of Mark's thick mustache Did not go unnoticed by Jackie. \"So if I gave urine that means I'm weak-willed?\" he inquired.\n\"Just don't do it again,\" Jackie laughed.\n\"Do what?\" asked Kelly, coming through the door. Mark went back to packing boxes so they wouldn't move around.\n\"Urinate,\" Jackie said. \"What's the name of that farm?\"\n\"Fnail. Fnail Farm, in Canada. The farm overseer reports that everything is fine and dandy, but the last transport didn't find any produce to load. There are other disturbing reports.\" Kelly said. She was watching Mark, who was shuffling crates with effortless grace. She made up her mind that the muscle was real, not silicone insert.\n\"So how do you two know each other?\" she asked.\n\"We worked together on a job for General Wind. Repairing power windmills.\" Mark placed his hands on the edge of a crate behind him and sat down on them.\n\"They had a joke about us,\" Jackie called over from the terminal. \"About how you remove a generator housing.\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" Mark grinned. \"Jackie holds the screwdriver against the screw and Mark rotates the generator. THEN she had the nerve to write on a recommendation form that I was 'young, but competent.' Tell me what that's supposed to mean.\" He jabbed an accusatory finger in her direction. Jackie giggled.\nKelly smiled politely, but she had this image of Jackie with the screwdriver which she felt mildly threatening.\n\"Arrrgh. You're right.\" `Jackie's moods seemed to switch without warning,' Kelly thought. She had been communicating with the terminal by keyboard and subvocally through the throat mike. Now she turned it off. \"From the farm's point of view everything's ok, but the other things flatly contradict that. We'll have to actually go to Canada to find out which machine is right.\"\n\"We've been on our way for five minutes,\" Kelly said.\nJackie looked stunned.\n\"You didn't notice? Your inner ear must be broken,\" Mark said generously. \"We've been turning corners and everything.\"\n\"Damn modern suspensions are too good,\" Jackie growled reflectively.\nIt was starting to grow dark, and drizzling, when they pulled up to the end of a gravel track and stopped. The black arms of wet bushes and trees stood around a huge shed and a low crumbling concrete structure. Dull green conifers rose up one hill. In the other directions lay small fields separated by windbreaks.\n\"...land is poor around here. Vast area, very low level agriculture. It's labor intensive to conserve the soil,\" Mark was saying as they got out of the van, wearing light hooded jackets and heavy boots.\nKelly went over to the shed and pulled open the big door.\n\"Machines in here. Tractors ... I wish I knew all the names.\"\nJackie followed her in, clanged around, and came back out.\n\"Most of the farm machinery is out. The storage bins are empty... Mark, what is it?\"\nMark had been standing in the rain staring off into the distance. He turned around.\n\"Nothing. Smelling the air. Getting a feeling for the place,\" he said. \"That should be the bot den,\" pointing at the squat concrete building.\nThey entered by a wide gate which had doors flung open. Lights came on. It was a large cavern with showers and water hoses for cleaning equipment and bots, farm robots. Side rooms held supplies. Mark headed purposefully for a heavy door on the back wall. The room behind it proved to be dry and heated.\n\"Weather can get pretty corrosive, even on the bots,\" Mark explained. \"And contacts.\" He pointed out a series of outlets in the wall. \"The bots come here to report the day's events, and to get their assignments in the morning as soon as it's light enough to work. The bigger contacts are for power. Recharging.\"\n\"I was told the farm overseer talked to the robots over radio,\" Kelly put in. Jackie was rattling at a door with a rusted padlock on it.\n\"Sure, a bit,\" she said. \"But the bots can remember a lot, especially botanical details. The data rate's too low. Same reason we'll be putting up a satellite dish. The van radio won't let us talk to the rest of the world as much as we want.\" The door wasn't giving.\n\"Mark, can you get this open? Otherwise I have to go back for a hacksaw.\"\nMark put his shoulder against it and pushed. The bar bent and came out of the frame. The door swung in.\n\"Cheap metal,\" he said.\nNo light came on here and there was a musty smell. When their eyes adjusted to the dark they saw several large cables passing through the room. One was connected to a large box on a bench, which was connected in turn to an old fashioned terminal. There was even a chair lying on its side.\n\"Hey, this looks like it used to be a control room for real live people,\" Mark breathed. \"Totally antiquated, twenties stuff.\"\n\"Cool it. Some of us are old enough to remember the twenties,\" Jackie said. She righted the chair and sat down in front of the terminal, raising a clowd of dust.\nMark found an outside door and opened it. The last of the daylight filtered in.\n\"What I wonder is where all the bots are. They should be coming home,\" he said.\nKelly peered out, wondering if she would see the earth-toned hominids ambling towards her through the weeds growing over the foundations of long-gone buildings.\n\"They are home.\" Jackie stood up alarmingly. \"According to this overseer, its storage bins are full of radishes, its fields are all plowed, and all twenty-four bots have been patiently sitting in the room we just came through, for the past hour.\"\nThey set off to look for the missing bots with flashlights. The drizzle had stopped. An invisible moon gave the cloud cover a uniform glow, enough to navigate by.\nKelly pushed through the underbrush of a windbreak, and came out on the other side. A bot was right in front of her ten paces off. It cocked its head slightly and watched her.\n\"Jackie, I have found one,\" she called out. In the flashlight beam it was brown, with black disks for eyes in an otherwise featureless face. Jackie came up beside Kelly.\n\"Stop. Test. Test,\" she said. The bot emitted a low hum. \"That's about all they say.\" She pulled out a complicated-looking probe and walked over, reaching for an access port on the bot's torso. A third beam of light fell on the brown figure. They heard Mark's footsteps.\nThe bot casually brought up its right arm and knocked Jackie's hand out of the way. She reached out again, and barely dodged a large swipe of the bot's arm - but tripped backwards in the grass. Kelly caught her, staggering in surprise at Jackie's weight. Muscle and bone. Kelly felt strangely excited. In spite of the jokes, Jackie couldn't be much over thirty-five.\n\"They're not supposed to do that. Anything like that. Ever.\" Jackie was breathing hard, and there was some fear in her eyes. Kelly wondered how she was supposed to feel.\nThe bot didn't do anything futher aggressive, and just stood there. Mark had run up and was now standing next to them.\n\"Let's stay away from that one,\" he said. \"Come on, I found a disabled one. It's probably safer.\"\nMark's bot was lying on its side at the foot of a grassy incline. It looked considerably less than human with several large panels removed. Mark's finger picked out details.\n\"See, here, the oil well's dry. I'll bet the joints are ruined. Hydraulic fluid's low. The battery's drained. There's a lot of physical trauma, especially to the computer casing. I've never seen a bot so mistreated. Usually the mechanical parts wear out after five or so years. This one's brand new.\" He straightened up. \"It almost looks like this bot TRIED to kill itself. And another thing I don't understand is why the operational one over there didn't bring this one in. They're supposed to take care of each other.\"\n\"This one was probably ordered to commit suicide,\" Jackie put in. \"I am sure that this was done through the overseer itself. I doubt we'll find many working ones.\"\nMark hoisted the casualty across his shoulders.\nThey drove the van around to the outside door of the little control room and carried in a bright light and set up their troubleshooting gear. Jackie quickly broke the system. It had been set up to deliberately destroy the bots, and to deny that anything was wrong.\n\"There're four bots left. They're not hostile anymore,\" Jackie stated. She yawned.\n\"Someone must have done that,\" Kelly said. \"I'm worried. Can we use the bots that are left as guards?\"\n\"Go right ahead. I'm going to bed.\"\nKelly got Mark to show her how to get a low-resolution picture (of shadowed darkness) through the bots' eyes, how to set an alarm on their motion detectors, and how to tell them to move around. For the rest of the night Kelly kept an avid watch on the nocturnal wildlife.\nShe also watched the two sleeping figures on the floor. She couldn't decide what to think of them. Some great conflict seemed to be brewing inside her.\nThe next morning before breakfast Jackie dragged them along to a small lake half a mile away.\n\"I found this place last night,\" she said, taking off her sweatshirt.\n\"But it's cold,\" Kelly said.\n\"So we get to prove we're Minnesotans.\"\n\"I didn't bring a swimming suit,\" Kelly continued. Mark and Jackie splashed in, both inarguably lacking swimming suits, and loudly proclaimed the water cold. Kelly shrugged and bowed to fate. She had to admit, it was ... invigorating.\nWhen they got back, Jackie immersed herself in the global communications network while Mark drove off to gather up the disabled bots, which the overseer was now able to locate. Kelly disappeared on some project of her own.\n\"Username Ari in Australia,\" Jackie announced when Mark returned. \"Means 'demon' in Icelandic, incidentally. Whoever did this came from there via Kamchatka, France, Argentina, and Estonia. Only thing is, the trail was obvious.\"\n\"Um,\" Mark said.\n\"I think it's a front doorbell. Here goes.\"\nSeveral minutes passed before the other end was picked up. A line of text spilled along the bottom of the screen.\n\"Old union handshake,\" Jackie said. \"Let's see if I can remember how to do this.\" After several apparently meaningless exchanges the screen cleared to show a bearded man with soft brown eyes and a red face.\n\"Ah. Jackie Allan,\" he said. \"I've heard of you. You went to the Institute of Wisconsin-Madison? Involved in the Chernobyl cleanup of '27, right? I'm Brent Alberts. Institute of Toronto.\" He looked at Mark. \"Who's our third party?\"\n\"That's Mark Eckert. I know him, he's ok,\" Jackie said.\nThere was a pause.\n\"You're not in Australia,\" Mark said impulsively. There was full sunlight behind the man's head.\n\"Not exactly,\" Brent laughed. \"I'm in a safe jurisdiction. Not that Jackie there couldn't find me if she really wanted to.\"\nJackie nodded at the compliment. Then she got down to business.\n\"I'm fixing a Canadian farm you set on self-destruct. Why?\"\n\"Maybe you heard about Excon's plan to raze a good part of the remaining Indonesian rainforest so they can build golf courses and luxury apartments for several thousand of their executives.\" Brent didn't waste words either.\n\"I read in the news. I assumed somebody was going to stop them.\"\n\"Me and some other people decided to do it. Only they've gotten smart since the Greenland affair. Hired sharp people as collaborators. They have actual human beings with guns on the site. Several of us got physically arrested and imprisoned under some barbaric Indonesian law.\"\n\"THAT I didn't read in the news.\" Jackie looked disturbed.\n\"So we decided on war. Excon has operations in automated farming, automated mining, automated manufacturing, and automated transport, all of them more vulnerable than the Indonesian construction site. This was a test. Tomorrow, it all goes. I think Excon will back down, but it'll be hell in a handbasket.\"\n\"I don't like the waste,\" Mark said slowly. \"It hurts me to see bots ruined.\"\n\"Neither do I. If we had something like an executive password, we could get at the bulldozers directly. Failing that, the feeling is that bots are more replacable than untouched ecosystems and endangered species. Also, that making an example of Excon will make Consolidated and the others listen to us the next time they try to pull something like the Orinoco salinization scandal. Jackie?\"\n\"Sorry. They gave me barely enough information to find the farm. We do have an executive, though ...\"\n...who at that moment burst into the room. At a keystroke, a lengthy quote from 'Njal's Saga.' covered up Brent's image.\n\"I saw some large shapes last night,\" Kelly said when she had ascertained that no one else was talking. \"There aren't any footprints out there today, but I found some two-toed tracks, deer or something.\"\nJackie tried to think of a good way to put it to her and couldn't.\n\"Kelly, your company's doing something really idiotic in Indonesia. We need your password to stop it,\" she stated.\nMark almost groaned.\nKelly's eyes widened. She looked back and forth between their faces, trying to decipher the expressions. She flushed.\n\"I think it is very nice that the company is able to provide beautiful houses for its administrators. Just because ... how dare you, you techie anarchist scum!\" She turned and ran.\nJackie grimaced and turned Brent back on.\n\"I assume you heard that.\"\n\"What a diplomat you are,\" he said drily. Mark grumbled something similar.\n\"You go talk to her, then,\" Jackie said. \"I'll go tell Excon I fixed their overseer, please send twenty new bots.\"\nKelly ran on past the lake and sat down, tears on her face, under a huge tree not far from one of the bots standing in the tall grass. The sky had cleared. The sun was out, and the air had the rich smell of evaporating rain. For several minutes she tried to figure out why she was crying, and what she would report to her superiors.\n\"What's the matter?\" a calm baritone voice asked out of nowhere.\n\"Who's there?\" Kelly looking around.\n\"Just me.\" The bot in the tall grass turned to face her. She froze in terror. It walked toward her casually, almost as if it were using body language to convey ease and confidence to her. Usually, robots walked purposefully.\n\"You are upset. Why?\" The same voice, imperturbably calm.\nShe tried to talk, swallowed, found her voice.\n\"I'm ... confused. How should I know about Indonesia, what to do? The techies, I mean the two people I came with, I can't trust them.\"\n\"Whom can you trust?\"\nShe thought of her superiors. Suddenly she couldn't remember why she had ever trusted them. Trust was poised in her throat like a boulder on the edge.\n\"I ... do trust them,\" she said, surprised at the words even as they came out of her mouth. \"Jackie and Mark. If someone could just explain to me ...\"\n\"They asked for your password so that I would be able to stop the Indonesian project directly. Species diversity is essential to the earth's ecology and is a part of human survival. If I can't stop it directly, I will kill tens of thousands of bots the way I killed the bots here, to stop it. That would be a great waste.\"\nKelly bit her lip and studied the horizon. Then she leaned over and whispered the word at the formless head which was bent to receive it.\n\"Thank you,\" it said.\nKelly stood up slowly and took a few steps. She wondered if she should say goodbye. Instead she said,\n\"Are you human? Or can they make intelligent robots now?\"\n\"They can.\" The bot rose. \"But they haven't. I am a human being named Brent Alberts, talking with you by means of a reprogrammed farm robot.\"\nKelly felt tricked, but she also felt like laughing.\n\"Why haven't they, then?\"\nThe bot paused for a second.\n\"An intelligent robot would be a citizen. What kind of life could we offer this person? Joints that wear out in five years? Poor eyesight, no sense of smell or touch, accidental death by power failure?\" He shrugged. \"With power comes responsibility. We must refrain from doing many things that we are capable of doing.\"\n`That made sense,' Kelly thought.\n\"Bye,\" she said.\nThe bot waved in a way that she decided was very suave.\nContest and published in the April 1991 issue.

And thus it was that Dexter Fox found his computer hyper-responsive, breathtakingly quick, almost as if the machine itself, fascinated by the program he'd outlined, were exceeding its own capacities out of some innate need to problem-solve. Things had been steadily improving for three days now; he'd debugged a quirky parser the first night, built an incremental speller the second, and was currently patching up, much to his surprise, that ambiguity resolution program his thesis advisor had recommended he leave to the hotshots at a bigger university.\nAs if on cue, Seymour Kofant burst through Dexter's door at nine, the squeaky drumroll of his sneakersteps still reverberating in the hall. He glared at Dexter wordlessly, his brows converging and an irate pucker to his mouth which made his moustache twitch as with an imminent sneeze.\n\"Howdy, Sy,\" managed Dexter in response. Might as well get this over with.\n\"I don't believe it. Your machine's still up.\" Sy shook his head and marvelled at Dexter's monitor a moment, where, in several windows, the lines were scrolling up furiously, at neck-and-neck intervals, like the collective output of a typist pool on Methedrine. \"And you've got a program zipping along at the speed of light. What gives?\"\nDexter tried not to seem smug; a difficult feat, since he hated Sy's guts. Sy was, like him, a doctoral candidate, and for two years they had shared a thesis advisor and a disquietingly similar thesis topic. Dexter had watched Phil Stein, their adviser, approve and support Sy's every move while his own were subjected to dubious scrutiny. Plus, to make matters worse, Sy (with Stein's recommendation, naturally), had just gotten a prestigious fellowship and would be able to complete his degree without working for a living.\n\"Don't know, Sy. Must be a bug in whatever you're trying to run.\"\n\"You're positively enjoying this, aren't you? I'm only text editing that paper Phil and I wrote last semester. You know that.\" With what familiarity Sy referred to their mutual lord and master; Dexter wasn't yet on a first name basis with Stein, and hadn't gotten around to co-authorship with him either.\n\"What can I tell you, Sy? Call a repairman if something's broken.\" Then he frowned at the screen as if it required his supervision. \"Got to get back to work.\"\nAnd Sy made his exit, red-thatched head shaking, muttering something just audible enough to sound impolite.\nThat scene had, more or less, played itself out three times now. Tonight, however, the script began to undergo minor revision. To begin with, Sy wasn't the only one to ambush Dexter's office demanding enlightenment; Flej Linghamani, Stan South, and Ruth Schnaz all paid him a visit in due course. Fortunately, he observed, their bewildered souls had been spared Sy's paranoia; however keen Dexter's pleasure in his computer's swift reflexes, he really couldn't claim the slightest responsibility for them.\nThe other new twist to the nightly routine involved what happened when Dexter tried to log off at eleven-thirty. He couldn't. The computer seemed quite set on other plans, so that Dexter's control-D provoked a flash of defiance from the screen, after which it began running his ambiguity program on the Finnegan's Wake passage which he had entered months ago in a perverse fit of frustration. Dexter felt himself considering an advanced case of the jitters. But then he decided against it, and, tidying his desk for the night, indulged in a tolerant sigh. \"As long as it gets my thesis done.\"\nLate the next afternoon, shortly before the departmental secretaries and undergrads cleared the building and went home to their apartments, trailers and dorm rooms, a representative of ConnExpert Systems, Inc. beamed up to the third floor of the Computing Lab, apparently at Sy's behest. Personally, of course, Dexter was in no rush to have his machine tampered with, despite yesterday's suggestion that Sy call someone in. Nonetheless, help was here.\n\"I'm Anne Starch,\" it rejoiced, in tones as unsullied and fresh as its white button-down blouse, \"here to check out those CEXSI workstations you called about. What seems to be the problem?\"\nFor a moment, no one answered, so startled were they to find a tool attache in the hands of a fortyish blonde over six feet tall. Then Sy, his paper close to deadline, managed to override first his tongue's jammed circuits.\n\"Well, Ms. Starch-- \"\n\"Oh, please.\" She held one large, graceful hand up, as solemnly as a diplomat. \"Call me Anne.\"\n\"Anne, then,\" Sy conceded, emending himself impatiently. \"The problem is that the workstations, which are fine by day, malfunction disastrously at night. In fact, only one of them will work at all-- \"\n\"That's not strictly true,\" chirped Flej nervously, aware he'd spoken out of turn. \"Only yours goes down completely. Ruth's and Stan's and mine just work so slowly that we can't get much of anything done. Until last night, anyway. Last night the machines were all down, except for Dexter's.\" He flashed a tentative smile at Sy.\n\"As I said,\" continued Sy, regarding Flej with distaste, \"only Dexter's, in that office to your left, will work at all. And it works abnormally fast, faster even than any of the others did when they were first installed.\"\n\"Hmm,\" said Anne, turning toward Dexter's office. \"We sold these to your lab just last month, didn't we?\"\nSy nodded, his moustache twitching like a bloodhound's jowls.\n\"I knew we should have stuck with more standard equipment,\" said Stan. He was the skeptic in the bunch, an Army colonel with doctoral aspirations, unimpressed by the course material he fought so hard to get the better of. No one could understand why he had chosen Intelligence Modelling as a field of study, but everyone stayed on good terms with him anyway, in case he wound up head of the Armed Forces Research Budget.\n\"But these workstations are terrific,\" protested Dexter. \"Why, that DIABLOS firmware is an absolute godsend.\" And he relished Anne and his own pun in a single grin.\n\"What is DIABLOS, exactly?\" purred Ruth in her intrepid contralto, adjusting the quarter-inch thick glasses which failed to obscure her handsome features. Sy inhaled sharply but refrained from comment; even he made allowances for the lab's most aesthetic recruit, who had defected from Communications so recently she still couldn't program her way out of a paper bag.\n\"DIABLOS,\" announced Anne, \"stands for 'Distributed and Balance Loading Operating System.' It's the ultimate in network operating systems, recently patented by CEXSI, and built into the microcode of your workstations. Essentially, each workstation gives up some of its independence in exchange for an occasional power boost.\" And she folded her arms triumphantly.\n\"Perhaps we should let Ms. Starch get to work,\" said Sy, thumping his fingers on the wall.\n\"Straightaway!\" concurred Anne, dipping her head beneath the doorframe to Dexter's office.\nAnd she spent the next couple of hours checking boards, running programs, and generally conducting the kinds of tests field engineers seem to thrive on. After scrutinizing Dexter's workstation, she did sequential spot-checks on the others and could find nothing amiss. But when she tried running all the machines at once, the malady Sy had complained of appeared within seconds. She took a step back, nonplussed for the moment, and then seemed to warm, slowly but thoroughly, to a hunch of the sort that sprang Archimedes out of his bath.\n\"I'll be back before you know it,\" she assured them, and no one doubted that a cure lay within reach.\nTwo evenings later, Anne returned, and, after tinkering expertly with each machine's insides, requested they be called up simultaneously. For several moments, a silence precarious as suspended breath overtook the floor. Then a heartening series of hiccups, composed entirely of clicks and beeps, issued from the various offices. And, last but not least, the sound of improved-rollover keyboards under heavy assault affirmed that a successful file-check was generally underway; the only anomalous noise throughout was made by Dexter's printer, hastily coughing out several pages before it lapsed into a coma.\nBefore Dexter even knew she was in his office, Anne had retrieved the print-out and was reading it poised on a corner of his desk, her face virtually radiant with satisfaction. Her perusal done, she straightened matter-of-factly, smoothed a crease in her dazzling blouse-front, and waited for the others to reconvene.\nSy, as usual, was the first one through the door. He regarded Anne suspiciously. \"How did you fix them?\"\n\"You may not like this,\" she warned him, pulling a newsclipping from her breast-pocket and unfolding it on Dexter's desk. \"I saved this from last week's paper because it disturbed me, involving CEXSI's good name as it did. The man it's about used to night-shift for the company; we never collaborated directly, but I do know that he was instrumental in developing DIABLOS. In fact, he ran the Quality Assurance tests on the workstations on this floor.\" She paused for effect, then nodded toward the clipping, inviting the whole group to read it:\n\"Transylvanian\" Computer Scientist Collapses at Arraignment\nAl Drake, a former employee of ConnExpert Systems, Inc., pled not guilty by reason of insanity to assault charges this morning, just moments before losing consciousness in an Orleans County courtroom. Drake had been in custody since the week before, when two off-duty policeman witnessed him wrestling a man to the ground in the parking lot of the Divisadero Pub and preparing to bite him on the neck. Drake was rushed to Canon General Hospital after collapsing, where his condition remains guarded, according to official sources.\nIn the State Psychiatric Hospital, which had been observing him since March 2, Drake reportedly secluded himself by day and, having refused all food and drink, required intravenous feeding; today, despite the Panama hat and dark glasses he wore to court, he was visibly distressed throughout by the skylights overhead. And yet another bizarre detail was added to Drake's profile today, by an unidentified courtroom witness who sighted what appear to be surgically-implanted fang teeth in Drake's mouth as he was carried by on stretcher.\n\"It was quite a job getting my client to plead properly,\" said Stokely Bramson, Drake's lawyer, who is confident the defendant will be dealt with leniently upon release from Canon General. \"You see, despite the special effects teeth and the Bela Lugosi complex, he is a compassionate, deeply sensitive being. He feels just terrible about what he's done.\"\n\"So?\" asked Stan.\n\"I don't understand either,\" admitted Ruth.\n\"My theory,\" said Anne, \"is that Drake actually is a vampire, who, like your typical loner with strange habits, took up computing as a hobby. He was a brilliant systems programmer, from what I've heard; supernatural powers, no doubt, add that certain edge. Anyway, it seems he found a way to embody the essence of vampirism in DIABLOS. Dexter's machine was slightly faster than the others to begin with, so his quite naturally became the focus of the vampiric gestalt. That's why it was up when the rest of yours were down, and why, the less functional your machines became, the more impressively his worked. I think his was sucking power --sorry, folks-- out of the other workstations in the net.\"\n\"Are we supposed to believe that?\" asked Sy.\n\"I wouldn't have asked you to fifteen minutes ago,\" replied Anne good-naturedly. \"But then I put my hypothesis to the test and proved it right.\"\n\"How?\" asked Flej, unabashedly wide-eyed.\n\"Well, the 'heart' of DIABLOS's bug was buried deep in the network protocol. To overcome it, I simply went into the transceiver boxes that hook the workstations to the network cable, and replaced the gold pins with silver ones.\"\nDexter was the only one to laugh out loud, though inwardly he groaned at the prospect of finishing his thesis sans ghostwriter. Ruth, her eyes bemused behind their icy windowpanes, stepped out to take a phone call from one of her current boyfriends. And Stan, who had sunk into yet another reverie of confusion, finally roused himself to ask what would have happened if Anne's maneuver had failed.\n\"Dexter's machine would have continued in the same vein -- sorry again-- drawing all it could out of the other machines in the net until they were, I hate to say, drained of juice irreparably. And then, had we decided to hook his power-thirsty machine into a new net? Who knows?\" She seemed cheered by the image of such a disaster.\nDexter, chuckling less cheerfully over his own disaster, realized suddenly what he'd have to do. Since DIABLOS, after all, was hardly flesh and blood, its recent demise should prove readily reversible; if Dexter --on some deserted night or two-- swapped Anne's silver pins with gold ones, he might still have his ticket to fame, thesis approval, and excellent job offers.\nFlej was struck by a thought just then. \"What do you think's happening at Canon Hospital? The doctors are bound to find out there's something weird about Drake. And why is Drake such a wimp? I thought vampires, until you got a stake through them, were supposed to be invincible; why hasn't Drake bloodsucked his was to freedom yet? Any guesses?\"\n\"Calm down, Flej,\" was Sy's to-the-point rejoinder.\nAnd then Anne produced the last read-out from Dexter's printer. \"We won't need to wait long for an answer to your questions, Flej,\" she said, and they quickly formed a reading huddle behind Flej's scrawny form:\nI'm the vampire Drake. I'm immortal. And I'm tired of it.\nI've walked the earth for a thousand years, the last two hundred of them a perdition of weariness and conscience. The former malady is an old one, grown more profound each time human history contrives to restage its hackneyed dramas; the latter is new to me, and I am helpless to quell it.\nI shrank from hallowed objects, once, though the kiss of blood was sacred on my lips; now I fear nothing from Heaven, from Earth, or from Hell, yet I loathe beyond hope what I do nightly for sustenance. And so I choose a vampire's death, having met already my mortal demise, but not --laugh well-- without satisfying first my thirst for immortality...\nCerise Palmer maintained her sanity as a graduate student in literature by reading as much F&SF in her spare time as possible; she now tries to write as much of it as possible.

The testing of a new lunar winch cart robot design!\nThe robot is the brainchild of Steve Kent, of Rockwell International Space Systems Division. A long-term advocate of cost-effective space application of existing technology, Kent proposed the idea of the winch cart in a paper entitled \"Prime Mover for Extraterrestrial Construction and Mining\". He describes in detail the use of this general purpose robotic winch cart design in a number of applications. On May 1st, Steve put his design to the test.\nWarn industries marketing manager Scott Salmon and design engineer Jerry Dilks were on hand to observe the performance of the Warn winch used on the robot. They provided the winch as part of a Rockwell\/Warn cooperative agreement. Phil Paterno, the Bureau of Land Management's realty specialist for the Prineville area, was there to monitor the use of the Oregon Moonbase site, common practice for activities performed on land leased from the BLM. Larry Chitwood, U.S. Forest Service geologist, just happened to be checking in at the Oregon Moonbase site on other matters when the testing began. The Lunar Base Research Team, a group of space researchers from the Oregon L-5 chapter of the National Space Society, manage and administer the Oregon Moonbase site.\nPreparation for the test started with assembly of the robotic unit, which had been broken down into several subcomponents for transportation from its original assembly point. After the unit was fully assembled, basic subsystem operations were checked and the unit was positioned for its most crucial test, anchoring into the soil with it's pair of auger units. The winch cart robot, or WCR, is intended to serve as a tow vehicle for a large variety of comparatively low technology earth and materials moving.\nThe basic notion of the WCR is to dig into the lunar soil and pull unpowered implements, like scrapers and rock sleds, from point to point. Keeping the electronics and other more vulnerable (and expensive) subsystems concentrated in the WCR, the costs of the total solution to lunar construction tasks can be minimized while increasing reliability at the same time. The implement towing concept is one that saw widespread terrestrial use around the turn of the century in farming applications, but where the pulling capacity of earth tractors is limited to roughly 60% of their weight, the low cost automotive type winch used with the winch cart can pull in excess of 200% of its own weight. This goes up in multiples as block and tackle are added.\nThe key element in the design is the auger mechanism used to root the WCR into the lunar soil. The original design contained only one auger, but the prototype tested had been modified to include two auger units. Either design version provides a machine that is theoretically capable of operating relatively independent of gravity, and may well operate in near zero gravity conditions.\nLBRT researcher Tom Billings manned the video unit while fellow team member Bryce Walden positioned the still camera. The anticipation mounted among the support crew and observers as they stood poised in readiness for the test to begin. The test started, and the whir of the auger clutches howled back in close competition with the wind blowing through the scrub of eastern Oregon desert. The whir continued, with no visible digging taking place. The auger clutches were complaining, protecting the auger mechanism from the strain and resistance of the soil. The clutch design would have to be modified.\nDisappointed but undaunted, Steve Kent continued other aspects of testing. He applied torque wrenches to the auger mount points to measure the resistance of the \"lunar analog\" soil at the Oregon Moonbase site to rotation of the auger blades. Unfortunately, a defective weld prevented much more testing in this area. Another design modification would be required before the WCR would be ready for lunar deployment.\nWithout the winches to anchor the WCR into the soil, testing of the winch mechanism would prove challenging. Manual simulation of the WCR boreholes, with help from LBRT researcher Cheryl Lynn York, gave the robot as close an approximation to normal anchoring as was possible under the circumstances. The winch was connected to a WARN staff vehicle to see if the vehicle, with parking brake locked, could be moved. The manual anchoring was not enough, however. This test would also have to wait until the auger situation was resolved.\nFaced with a short term setback, Steve reviewed the data of the day, determined to incorporate the information from the tests and the feedback from the observers (including geologist Larry Chitwood) into his modifications for the WCR. The tests were not all successful, but the testing process was. Such efforts, performed as a standard part of the design implementation cycle, should result in space hardware that is space-ready when it leaves earth.\nThe Oregon Moonbase\nThe Oregon Moonbase is a project of The Oregon L-5 Society, Inc..

Salvaged, have I, OF DOMINGO these three -- the Preparation, the Outworlder, the Fleets of Kairos -- the best ever composed A.Y. Tanaka in our garbled tongues, the jewels right priceless of our people.\"\nAS MOST OF OUR READERS HAVE ALREADY REMINDED US, this year marks the four-hundredth anniversary of the publication of Joe Domingo's epic poem, The Preparation of the Mining Planets, one of the highlights of Outer World literature. The author of this month's guest essay is Professor of Literature and Humanities at Ganymede University and senior editor of the thirteen-pack Bibliography of Domingo Studies.\nUnlike most works of Outer World literature, notice and appreciation of The Preparation of the Mining Planets, based on the poet's Brigade experiences, began almost immediately upon publication. That the epic quickly found a strong and friendly reception is reflected in the work of Domingo's younger contemporaries, the poets and dramatists of the so-called Generation of `098:\nIn Pygmalion's Brood by Sarton, the young esthete cries, \"Oh, to have Domingo's balls, and stride, clanking, onto an alien planet.\" The old uncle later asks, \"How can I wax comfortable when Joe Domingo calls?'\nIn Milgrom's Thy Brother's Captor, the landlord threatens the rent strikers: \"I'll call in Domingo and his crew and he'll prepare you as he did those planets.\" To which the strikers reply, \"Ah, but Domingo shares our grit and crib. If one's to be prepared, `tis you, Goldark. Be prepared, then, to be prepared.\"\nIn The Quaestor by Sienkowicz, the not-so-mad geographer reveals his treasure: \"Ah, look here, young thane. Salvaged, have I, these three -- the Preparation, the Outworlder, the Fleets of Kairos -- the best ever composed in our garbled tongues, the jewels right priceless of our people.\"\nGarth de Vega in Blood Tribute says of his Domingo-like protagonist, \"He retrieved for Earth the pearls we thought we'd wasted.\"\nThe plastic arts of that Generation offer even greater testimony. Helion's massive free-standing \"Orthos\" in Haymarket Square on Phoebos won the Credo\/Humanitas award three years running -- a first for that medium. The neo-Classical \"J.D. Accepting the Victory Flowers at Buzzard's Hill\" (inspired by canto 14, stanza 32) by an anonymous committee of art students, still stands at the entrance to Delacroix Hall at the College of Ceres and Tethys.\nMalan's \"Rhodes Passing the Torch\" stood for years at the Teynesian museum but has been moved, under pressure from the Nova movement, to the garden of the Mercantile on Miranda. Aspiring actors have long made the pilgrimage to the museum, and now to the garden, to study the subtle play of emotion on the face of the Rhodes figure. Is that joy we see? Or jealousy? Or anger? Or remorse?\nReynaud's \"Execution of the One Called the Desert Monster\" (inspired by 19:65-87) in the public library of Thanatos-in-the-Valley, is frequently visited by xenologists and historians for whatever clues it may provide to the aliens' way of life.\nA triumph of the neo-Romantic school, yet owing much to the sculptor's Sino-Hellenic background, is Chrysostum's \"Young Sir at the Fortress\" (inspired by 19:14-24) which for decades moved the young to strip bare and throw themselves at the statue's base. Sadly, it rests now in the provincial vault at Scone.\nThe professional literary critics held aloof. Those taste-makers of the time, defenders and beneficiaries of the codes of presentation, feared ruining their image as cool sophisticates. Off camera, they enjoyed and valued the Preparation but spoke of it only in flashes: \"Interesting ... More or less worthy of attention ... Appears perhaps engrossing ... Makes one feel good ... Revenge against dullness ... There is spirit here ... I find no fault ... One might, in one's spare time, consider this ...\"\nListening to them now, they sound like snippets from fuller essays and critical reviews, but these short phrases were the reviews themselves, tossed off casually in personal communications or mentioned in passing in the middle of an article on an unrelated subject. It smacked of danger, or so those tender souls imagined, to challenge too vigorously the dictum that nothing of merit could come from the Outer Worlds. It was their dictum, and theirs to modify.\nIn his posthumous Dragons of Io the converted critic Pinella says, \"The mining planets would be dead now were it not for the creative fire of Domingo.\" \"A strange evaluation,\" says Roehn, \"considering the devastation Domingo left behind.\" Llolf adds, however: \"I suspect Pinella meant (given the vagaries of the Tongue) that our memories of those planets as historic -- not merely geologic, economic, astronomic -- entities would be `dead' now were it not for the creative fire of Domingo. For only in verse was his fire creative.\"\nHovic's brief eulogy for Domingo at the federation's memorial service has mesmerized and been memorized by generations of schoolchildren: \"He was the first, perhaps the last, to stand and speak so well of us.\" Hovic later remarked to friends, \"He sure beats Torqua,\" a reference to the leading (\"lonq dead,\" Hovic would interject) epic poet of the preceding age, the undaunted author of the heroic cycle that included Orlando Inflamed, The Liberation of Mars, and Orlando Beyond.\nAdaptations for broadcast, recordings and live performance made Domingo rich as well as famous. Surprisingly unchallenged by the philosophical community was the series of sequels on the Ether-for-the-Millions network: Preparation II through VIII. Despite its elitist name, the network's ratings were consistently high. The set of programs is still available in home pad form and sells well despite the unfortunate withdrawal by the Cromwell administration of Preparation IV, which deals with the relationship of J.D. and Salinch in detail considered much too graphic.\nAs often happened when an epic caught the popular fancy through print, tape, disk, sphere or broadcast (on some planets, by roving talkers) many a world saw folk ballads and other lyrics arise, based on the characters and episodes of the poem. Extrapolata, they are called in the Catalog; on the Outer Worlds they are known as commentaries. Even today, in some Exilarchates, a mellow patron will pinch a serving lad or wench and call, \"Sing us a commentary, youth, for the ears are dry and sad.\"\nFor reasons analysts have yet to uncover, much commentary inspired by the Preparation re-tells it from the point of view of the aliens, giving Preparation extrapolata its plaintive tone. \"Salinch's Lament,\" born of the episodes of canto 12, stanzas 7-67, is the most familiar, but worthy of a hearing are also \"Who Dares Call Me a Monster?\" (6:52), \"Pray, Where Has My Flesh Gone?\" (7:65),\n\"What Voice Calls Them From `Neath the Sand?\" (1:18), \"The Great Wheels Roll\" (4:87), as well as \"None But I Remember,\" \"The Cubs Were Happy Once,\" \"The Smoke That Kills,\" and \"The Hills are Gone,\" all based on the episodes of canto 19.\nThis process both confirms and refutes J\/23, which holds that folk ballads are the surviving fragments of lost ancient epics. The implication is that the common people are too dense or too busy to create ballads and other lyrics, even love songs, on their own. That \"Salinch's Lament\" and the others derive from Domingo's epic (although it was a recent one) seems to support the theory. However, that the ballads are not surviving fragments but thoughtful re-workings of a still unfragmented epic suggests some common people are not too dense or too busy to create ballads and other lyrics, even love songs, on their own.\nAs also happened when an epic sold an immodest amount of copies, was continually re-broadcast by popular demand and was talked, and talked of, on many a planet, there appeared imitations; at best, attempted approximations. Among the works produced by LTs, intellectuals, warriors and administrators on various worlds, only a handful enjoyed more than a tired nod from critics and public. We pass over the Cultivation of the Orchard Planets (as well as the Plucking of the same), the Shattering of the Granite Planets, the Awakening of the Sleeping Planets, etc., with a kind word only for that clever parody of the whole epidemic, Lloy's Milking of the Dairy Planets. Sadly, Lloy's wit was not appreciated during her brief lifetime.\nAlthough rushed and uncrafted, the most important of these imitations is Miner's Planet, Briqadier's Blood by Jardine. In his very first stanza he asks, \"Who dares to speak beyond Domingo? Only those whose ears have heard the truth.\" Jardine offers nothing new about the nature, value or meaning of the expeditions; he merely changes the hero's name. In the Preparation it is \"J.D.\" (by more than coincidence, also the initials of the poet). But in Jardine's version, the Domingo-character's \"violent nature\" and \"warped, mistaken priorities\" more than once jeopardize the mission of the Brigades in general and Group A (A-Corps) in particular. Only the courageous and cool-headed leadership of Lt. Ceniza saves the day and leads the Brigades to victory.\nAs we know, the Ceniza-character also appears in Domingo's poem, not by name, but as the \"punk lieutenant,\" that incompetent officer whose mistaken attitudes toward the troops, the planets, the aliens and the principles of leadership more than once jeopardize the mission of the Brigades in general and A-Corps (Group A) in particular. As we now know, Jardine was, in real life, Ceniza's nephew.\nJardine and Ceniza shared many relatives -- writers, critics, editors, professors of literature, librarians, broadcasters and publishers. Their cumulative influence permitted Jardine's epithets to enter the standard phrasebooks of Preparation critics and scholars. In addition to his \"violent nature\" Domingo was accused of \"insubordination in the field,\" \"lack of perspective\" in his behavior as well as in his poetry, \"unfortunate slippage\" in his grasp of truth, and the `perverse inability to understand and express the significance\" of the events he narrates.\nSome charges were mutual. \"Lack of perspective,\" for example. Defending the actions of the Brigades in the episodes of canto 19, Domingo's comrade and biographer writes: \"You must understand that the `wild geese' on Chaco, unlike other forms of life, were biologically and spiritually incapable of conforming to the most fundamental standards of the human\/alien relationship. Enlightened Treatment just did not work; it only encouraged their senseless attacks.\" Jardine`s grandson replies, \"But true Enlightened Treatment had never been tried. Governor Andros used the term to obscure his real policy, that of active oppression and indirect genocide, while diverting attention from his Commissary tapes. Understandably, the Chaqui had to defend themselves. \"\nIt was Verne, the chief literary authority of the next generation, who translated the Preparation into the Tongue, giving it a wider audience, and was the first to publish an edition bristling with notes. In his preface Verne praises the war speech of the Desert Monster, finding it utterly noble. \"The speeches and character of the other leading aliens are \"inspiring and realistic\" and \"almost human.\" He is `aroused by Domingo's \"spirit of patriotism ... [and] ... the concept of the tree of honor and glory, which, as J.D. so nobly expresses, we nourish with our bold deeds and the blood or comparable fluid of our enemies, the tree we leave behind to give shade to our tomb.\"\nSome weak-hearted readers sighed at Domingo's, and Verne's, emphasis on that tree, for it seemed to obviate the need to store up so-called good deeds in the present life to sustain us in the next. Domingo's attitude implied the afterlife mattered little; what mattered more was the fame achieved in this one, that you lived on only in the memories of those who had known you and would tell others about you. Quiet, ostensibly constructive, activity did not bring the sort of fame Domingo and his fellows sought. Rather, it was the courting of danger, and the triumph, and the triumph's noise recorded. Plunder was not frowned upon if well-earned.\nDespite his arousal, Verne regretfully gave a low rating to the work as a whole: \"It lacks unity, purpose, creative inventiveness and, ultimately, grandeur.\" And elsewhere: \"The poem is more savage than the worlds of which it treats.\"\n\"Words, words, words,\" comments Monten. \"Our Verne, the progressive, the enlightened one, just couldn't bear to call the poem great. He had to steer a middle course between the Wimps and the Hawks. Since the Hawks were then in the Roost, he'd appear a self-degrading brown-noser were he to overly praise their favorite poet.\"\nThe edition of the Preparation generally held to be definitive is that prepared by Domingo's great-grandson, Javier C. Noriega, using the original battlefield tapes preserved in the cool vaults of the poet's wine cellar. Noriega's extensive introduction gives us new insights into Domingo as a human being and creative artist. The tapes help clear up some disputed areas of interpretation, such as whether \"rooking the stalwarts\" or \"booking the recruits\" is the correct reading in 2: 8, whether \"lying to the tribe\" or \"spying on the Five\" belongs in 8:13, whether \"dun-colored landscape\" or \"dawn covered the landscape\" is the intent in 2:11, whether the mysterious and suggestive \"flower of life\" that saves Corporal Saad in the wilderness (3:29-33) is rather the \"dower(y) of life.\"\nMyrnes concedes Noriega`s edition surpasses all others before or since, even those claiming to be based on more complete battlefield and apres-querre tapes supposedly uncovered from time to time in one or another Domingo-frequented locale. \"This excellence,\" explains Myrnes, \"derives from Noriega's performance as a conscientious scholar as well as a loyal grandson. His edition, with its exhaustive notes and commentary, offers the complete armamentarium of traditional and modern scholarship, giving full weight to the insightful interpretations of the neo-Ganymede and deutero-Raphaelite schools [...] although perhaps without at times allowing for sufficiently imaginative and searching investigation of stylistic elements, such as, for example, a line-by-line, foot-by-foot, even phoneme-by-phoneme exegetical study of the established [i.e., the wine-cellar] text along the lines of Lauren Sterne's admittedly involved but uniquely innovative and revelatory meta-stylistic criticism.\"\nMyrnes' proposal is suitable not so much for the analysis of the Preparation as for the analysis of the work of some of the Preparation's scholarly critics.\nIt was Ash who first formally doubted the Preparation was rightly an epic: \"It fails to meet certain rules; for example, An epic shall relate the deeds of an idealized, larqer-than-life hero (Soncino 362). In the Preparation there's no larger-than-life hero explicitly identified as such.\"\nBut that is wig-splitting; there is a hero, a normal-sized hero, a common soldier who does uncommon things. Although ordinarily the commander of Group A would be the one to hoist the Flourig, that commander unfortunately is the \"punk lieutenant.\" The real hero, J.D., is always there to redeem the lieutenant, the Group, the Brigades, not by doing all the fighting -- though he probably could if he had to -- but by inspiring and leading the troops. Domingo, while not overly humble, shares the glory with the Corps. (\"To spread the guilt,\" suggests Aymara.) But he is too modest to reveal himself through more than his initials. In this also he breaks precedent; in a tradition going back to the original Daughter of Mars cycle, initials had been used only to identify the villain.\nRhorta points out J.D. engages in some cunning, often humorous, stratagems -- another trait of the traditional epic hero (Baris 13, Vaughan 806). One example is the ruse by which a herd of aliens on Iesi was allowed to capture a purposely abandoned sandroller primed to explode when the starter switch was thrown. That the \"capturers\" were a band of adventurous pups, not the seasoned warriors the pompous First Colonel had vehemently predicted, fulfills one of the most important comic requirements -- the surprise deflation of a stuffed shirt.\nAsh insists the rule specifies an idealized hero; that is, without vices. Cyrus answers: \"Read on. A further rule [no citation] permits vices, but vices the hearers understand, if only in their subconscious. These vices must be larger-than-life (or minimal) to the extent the hero and his virtues are larger-than-life (or minimal). Consider J.D.'s gross mistreatment of Salinch. In civilized worlds such behavior is unthinkable, yet many among us long to perform those very acts upon each other and are unaware of that longing.\"\nWonath reminds us there is a central explicit hero, a collective hero: \"The Brigades as a whole, operating in unity for a common purpose, to make the universe a better home for humankind.\" But Dolph suggests Wonath and his party are \"victims of confused judgement. Military units don't feel, bleed and die; it's their individual members that feel, bleed and die. Any of ours who assaulted a Chaqui or Credenti stronghold -- never mind how `primitive' or `defenseless' some now claim they were -- or who defended our stations from the Desert Monster's unprovoked attacks, deserves recognition as a hero. The role of J.D., whoever he may be, is not to hog the camera, but to crystallize within himself the best qualities of his comrades.\"\nDomingo's biographer cites a rule that seems to favor the poem's claim to epic status: An epic shall relate the deeds of valiant heroes, magnanimous to their foes (Mbona 848). To which Barcos, a noted Wimp, responds: \"Valiant, perhaps, but magnanimous only in their insistence that they are magnanimous; magnanimous only if execution without excessive torture is magnanimous; magnanimous only if the destruction of entire civilizations with a `sincere' apology is magnanimous.\"\nThe biographer quotes a further rule: There shall be a foe worthy of the hero (Portales 63). Barcos responds: \"Depends what you mean by worthy.\"\nThe biographer cites a further rule: The nobility of the foe shall be acknowledqed (Sung 37). Barcos responds: \"Ah, but you omit Sung's key word -- `ungrudgingly.' Domingo must have been terribly worried the foe would appear so noble the audience might not feel threatened enough to root for the hero or buy his book. It was a needless worry. For centuries, now that the coyote, the dingo and the pangriff are extinct, the insecure and marginally competent Terroid has been ever eager for something small enough to kick around, something big enough to get even with.\"\nThe biographer's point is well taken, though, in that there are scenes in the Preparation that do tend to acknowledge the foe's nobility, but the premise of the work would be undermined were this presented too forcefully. There is the execution of Xka and his pack, where Xka indignantly breaks air in the face of the laser bearer. In a similar episode the Desert Monster stares at the executioner for long moments and then, realizing, cries, \"A woman! The Desert Monster shall not sully the conscience of an unborn child!\" Domingo continues: \"Then that noble Monster with claws well fashioned did tear his [own] innards out and died unshamed.\"\nDelius, doing research at the Black Chamber, discovered the original scansion and rhyme scheme called for \"heart\" rather than \"innards.\" He postulates \"heart\" would have inspired too much sympathy for the Monster.\nThe biographer cites a further rule: The protaqonist must capture the imaqination and spark the enthusiasm of the reader\/auditor (Dewi 693). Barcos responds:\n\"Depends on the reader\/auditor.\"\nSome claim the Preparation fails to meet the standards of the heroic epic in that it has no love interest, and little interaction between the male and female members of the Brigades; perhaps Domingo did not care to call attention to his own or others' activity in that area. The oddly-formed alien females were available every seventh week or so, but J.D.'s attitude was negative: \"Any might have them in any of their parts, were any gross enough.\"\nDespite this, J.D.'s own seduction of Salinch, the Desert Monster's daughter, is a key element of the poem. It also meets the epic standard (Plekhanov 328) requiring at least one of the love interests to be closely related to someone in authority on the enemy's side. It also meets the standard (Vaughan 806) requiring the hero to engage in clever stratagems: The sole purpose of the seduction, J.D. insists, is to gain her golden key and the secrets of the Monster's fort.\nThe rule bifurcates: The love interest shall not seriously distract the hero from his\/her goal [see Orlando Beyond] unless the love interest him\/herself is the goal [see Orlando Inflamed] (Kreshkhine 74). Domingo takes the first option by having J.D. execute Salinch: \"She taught me great pleasure and thus taught me great sin; it was right she be punished.\"\nRyder declares this \"Irresponsibility poorly disguised as Honor.\" Barcos: \"One's reason is another's excuse.\"\nAnother rule states, The hero shall at some point in the narrative engage in communication with the dead for aid, advice or inspiration to the extent, if necessary, of visiting the after\/underworld in person (Besant 236). This rule can be traced back to fragments of Orpheus the Nazarene, who smashes the gates of Plutarch's realm to rescue Father Abraham from the one-eyed Grendel.\nThe Preparation satisfies this rule. The shafts dug by the first humans on Credence qualify as underworld; into them J.D. descends to burn out the last refuges of the Credenti. The gray sandstone canyons of Eboli into which J.D. and his fog-sprayers descend for a like purpose, also satisfy the requirement. So does J.D.'s descent into the \"multi-chambered, endlessly delightful\" body of Salinch. His psychological descent into hell -- that is, the entire relationship with Salinch, with its haunting (or hollow) guilt -- also satisfies it.\nMoody and introspective, J.D. has no close friends. Aware of this, Ash cites yet another rule: The hero shall have two friends and both shall die (Pindar 17). The first must have already died on the enemy's toe before the poem begins, to justify the mood of anger and intense resolution in which the reader finds the hero. The second must die in battle also, no more than two-thirds of the way into the narrative, to stoke the hero's anger and resolve against the foe. This second friend must be a former enemy, at least a rival, who became attached to the hero through admiration of his virtues, preferably after falling under his toe in physical or mental combat.\nSome rules allow the first death to be that of a former lover. Others permit, or require, someone senior to the hero, a significant other of his formative years. The loss must be deeply felt, but not so deeply as to demoralize him; the effect is to encourage him to continue the great tradition the significant other represents. The second death, that of the converted friend (some rules permit a lover or a younger relative) must be so described as to emphasize the loss of the promise the life represents, to justify the call to vengeance. (See Addenda Bellica 36, Addenda Poetica 87.)\nAsh cites another, the \"Basic\" Rule: The epic shall be completely removed from everyday experience (Hashomer 299). Quint and his school are not concerned about that. What impresses them is the basic realism of the Preparation. The primitive epics, Quint says, dealt with real heroes in real situations, merely enlarged and exaggerated to make the story come alive, which is to say, more real. He demonstrates how Domingo skips back millennia to the earliest unwritten version of the Basic Rule: Make it fantastic, make it outrageous, make it impossible, but make it believable (Apollonius 32).\nQuint's influence on poets of his and a few succeeding generations was incalculable. His emphasis on believability and the flavor of realism led to an avalanche of epics based on news articles and reports in scientific journals. Braght even attempted an historical epic based on articles in the recently unearthed Pravda.\nTo C.M. Pidal the question of rules was not important: \"Bear in mind that Dimon's Asteroidians, Sato's Nouveaux Voyages Synchroniques Merg's Joviad and Saturniad, and Torqua's famed Orlandiad -- some of the epics used to set the standards the Preparation supposedly does not meet -- were themselves imperfect imitations of something much older. When rules did serve a purpose was among the predawn bards who composed in their heads, and those were but the rules of survival. The bards faced the challenge of a society too busy fighting or working to take much time out for a long epic. They faced the challenge offered by other forms of entertainment -- songs, dances, religious ceremonies, food, sex, conversation, public executions, and instrumental music as an end in itself rather than as a setting for the bard.\"\nConsider, continues, Pidal, how Domingo or any other more-or-less modern epicist differs from the bards of the pre-dawn age. In 12:18 Domingo tells how \"The Polthark came ready for battle, dripping with oil, swinging his wrench, spitting a Damniad, sweating a torrent, heavy with anger, paging for blood.\" A cogent, emphatic description, sufficient for its purpose.\nNote how this differs from Domingo's probable inspiration, stanza 67 of The Striped Flag by the obscure Bard of the Hurons: \"The Yankee came ready for battle, the Yankee came dripping with oil, the Yankee came swinging his [wood? stick? tool? wrench?], the Yankee came spitting a Damniad, the Yankee came sweating a torrent, the Yankee came heavy with anger, the Yankee came paging for blood.\"\nFor what purpose must the Huron repeat himself so? In part, it gives him that extra moment to remember the rest of his line. It also helps draw things out, building up for the cathartic head-splitting in the next stanza. But most important for the Bard's survival, it extends the grace period for those in the audience who have turned aside to sneeze, to talk to a friend, to stroll over to a merchant's stall, to scan the skies for argosies, to soothe or whip a restless eohipp, or to go further off to relieve themselves. When they turn back, even having missed the opening line (\"The Yankee came...\") they might yet hear the closing line (\"The Yankee came...\") and not have lost the chord. The Bard of the Hurons thus keeps his audience and earns his sips and wafers.\nConsider, continues Pidal, how the first bards tapped into the lives of the weapon-bearers of their kraals and camps who unwound each evening around the eating place, singing and bragging. The bards added what those truly involved in the action could not -- the iangis and universality. Through them the local hero, who was also perhaps the local Odius, becomes Everyhero, who smites the evil Omper on the ice not for the kick of it (any local hero can do that) -- but for us.\n(Those who became the bards may well have taken the only option free to them, for tradition says many a bard was blind, lame or mad.)\nPart of the iangis came from the handing-on of tales and tricks from bard to bard: How to play the audience, how to play the voice, how to cover for a skipped or premature stanza, how to deal with comments from the crowd such as, \"That's a lot of bull, old man.\"\nWell now. The old man might counter with a new stanza, not always impromptu (Long have I souqht the moment for this): \"And noble [name], brother to the thunder, spoke [and the old man appears to address the heckler], `Let those who moan and weep with fear, who scoff to hide their shame, who cry that such brave deeds cannot be done, who've lost the heart, nobility and strength -- be given pots of lead and freed to seek their innards in the dirt.'\" If it veers to the click of it, it stays.\nOr the old man might silently acknowledge it was indeed a lot of bull, and begin to subtly re-string his tale.\nWithout the handing-on from bard to bard, from pulse to pulse, without the challenge met of yet another crew that will not sit still, one loses the iangis.\nThe epicist of later times who sees published his own final, un-evolved version, has skipped the iangis. The rules mean nothing when the world that gave birth to them is gone.\nThe iangis came from what the bards lived through. But there are no more bard-worlds and no more bards. Now it must all take place within the poet's mind. But few in any age, on any planet, can profit from that Odius on the sidelines of the brain who calls, \"That's a lot of bull, old man.\"\nLunet suggests Domingo has made the most of his encounters with that heckler. And with the eohipp snorts and peddler's cries and the other distractions of the marketplace within his head. And that explains the unexpected iangis of his work. Any Pioneer can prepare a mining planet, any Chronicler can report it, but only Domingo can take us with him.\nDisregarding the evidence, however, Pelagius (although the most well-read of his or any other generation) calls the Preparation \"more chronicle than epic.\" Kitner says the work, especially cantos 3, 9 and 13, is \"merely rhymed history.\" And Imbers calls it a \"fairly competent journalistic account with some esthetic value here and there.\"\nAnthiel disagrees: \"Any extended poem successfully arousing heroic emotions is obviously an epic poem. That is the only rule; the Preparation certainly follows it.\"\nAn entire generation of critics studied and discussed a series of dichotomies (schizophrenias to some) nascent in the Preparation: Light vs. shadow, heart vs. head, body vs. mind, faith vs. reason, passion vs. restraint, action vs. reflection, solidarity vs. individualism, conformity vs. rebellion, communion vs. alienation, fantasy vs. realism.\nYndran of Academe sees two faces of Domingo reflected in the work, the \"bearded\" and the \"shaven.\" One surveys nature, accepting without complaint what nature offers -- the heat, the sand, the noise, the squabbles among the troops, the apparent dearth of acceptable human sexual partners, the distance from home. The other looks for means and opportunity to escape the givens of nature, thence to dominate them.\nFor the shadowy journalist Ampere -- long suspected to be Yndran's alter-ego --Domingo \"clearly can't decide whether to tell the truth and run or lie through his teeth and stick around for the party. Do we really want to befriend him, to read him, to go where everyone has been before? A so-called epic that needs excuses made for it by the poet's great-great-whatever-grandson is a poor starter in the great-works-of-art sweepstakes.\"\nThe psychoanalytic approach Yndran unconsciously proposes (or is it Ampere?) forms the core of Pandit's famous monograph, made yet more famous by Tyree's aggressive review of it: \"Even though a few interesting ideas pop up, or seem to, here and there, P's m-graph as a whole is stuck in the primeval gunk of that perverse neo-eruditic tradition that pants for any little fruitless complication to impair, belabor, confuse or distort the appreciation, evaluation and enjoyment of a work of art. Take one example, just one. Pandit imagines he's discovered a manic brotherhood, a schizophrenic communion, a sort of [deleted] Anonymous across the years between Domingo and Torqua; both ran from\nreality while pretending to record it. A schizophrenic communion? Come now, Dr.P.\n\"Further on we get into the good stuff. Our erudite and intellectually adventurous Dr. Pandit sees in the towered fortress of the Desert Monster a phallic symbol, appropriate to the masculine life-style of the unrefined and unrefinable aliens. It's symbolically thrust at the, er, heart of the effeminate, or unashamedly feminine humans, whose emblem -- a golden donut through whose enlarged hole is seen a stylized Earth paradise -- is considered suggestive by some. Will Dr. P get away with this?\"\n\"Hardly,\" answers Mlavy, \"for when seen from above -- from the Spirit of Kiev, which J.D. commanded the first day of the assault -- the fortress with its redoubts resembles rather a vagina in a forest of pubic hair, and the advancing column of the A-Corps appears as a throbbing phallus. Such at least can be inferred from 17:12-15.\"\n\"Farfetched and gross, the both of you,\" interjects Pharsis, for whom the fortress represents the high-aiming aspirations of the Earth people, while Nodre sees in the dark fortress (\"shadow's realm\" of 8:3) those regions of the human psyche ever alien to us.\nGenerations of critics have kept alive the controversies of Domingo's time, and added more. Caye faults the poem its \"unevenness,\" its \"incoherence\" (probably in the sense of looseness\/smooth-flowing) and, most distracting to him, its \"dislocated episodes.\" Naively, he assumes certain episodes should have logically taken place before or after certain others. Domingo's biographer responds that Caye had obviously not been present at the Preparation, when at times everything took place at once, or when events were planned to happen when they would be least expected, least defended against, most demoralizing to the aliens and most effective.\nCaye also faults Domingo's \"prolixity on minor themes,\" such as the thirty-two lines on the design and manufacture of the poet-warrior's belt buckle. In an earlier time the buckle was of greater importance in military life and might have merited the space, but by Domingo's time the buckle was superfluous. The dwelling upon it was forced, mannered and boring.\nRindl was not bored, though, for if Domingo \"felt called upon to include it in his epic there must have been something of epic relevance to it.\" Nor was Stang bored, for \"we unconsciously transport ourselves back to when such things mattered.\"\nIn his short paragraph, Caye disparages the work's sterile theme ... intense sterility ... .sterility of thought and deed...cornucopia of sterile images...[and its] overwhelming, all-encompassing sterility, doing poor justice to Domingo's poetic imagination, what little remains of it.\" Otherwise, Caye is favorably impressed: \"I find, for the most part, correct grammar, lively descriptions (where the event described is itself lively) and a variety of characters, some of whom almost come alive.\"\nCompare this with the later comments of Hideki Torres: \"The true poetry's less in the verses themselves than in Domingo's lofty conceptions, the most stirring being the solidarity of humankind in the face of alien intransigency. (In the Popular Classics edition of Torres' essays, the phrase was changed to \"the alien menace.\") Closer to Caye is Alain's lukewarm praise: \"Although one notes a certain lack of imagination, it is more than made up for by a careful avoidance of banality.\"\nYuen feels it unjust to condemn what some consider the lack of poetic imagery in the Preparation. He suggests one cannot fairly compare Domingo with such as Torqua, who was a unique blend, even for those times, of artist and intellectual -- not called to it by fate or genes but fallen to it by circumstance. Torqua spent much of his youth recovering from sports injuries, including a broken leg during a lunar lacrosse match, severe burns at the laser-fencing peiste, temporary deafness and spasms of incoherent ramblings after being trapped below the surface while running the methane rapids, and partial paralysis from defects in a gravity\/anti-gravity slide. His long stretches of decommission allowed him time to delve extensively into the classic and pre-classic epics, literary and primitive, ecclesiastic and secular, and to base his Orlando work upon them.\nDomingo, however, remained a man of action, metaphorically ambidextrous -- a sabre in one hand, a stylus in the other -- for he composed as he fought. A microphone was sealed to his helmet, another to his collar, and as a comrade told it, \"he prattled much, even in the heat of things.\"\nDomingo thus returned to the very birth of the epic: the challenge (Eya!) the shout of triumph (Eya!) the retelling (And then I...).\nOne must admit Domingo owes much to his predecessor and \"companion in schizophrenia,\" Torqua. Pandit, in his more restrained moments, shows how Domingo, despite his facade of rudeness and tumult, shares Torqua's bold yet elegant line, his rich and valiant vocabulary, his feel for the vibrant verb, his bald gusto for breeze-blown banners, his freedom from self-consciousness in the face of alliteration.\nConsider Torqua's \"The castellated spires of Duke Menton's cramped keep did glower darkly over the stream-streaked landscape\" (Orlando Beyond 14:76), how it finds subtle echoes in Domingo's \"The spoked spires of Dragon Man's cramped keep glowered darkly over the arroyo-crackled landscape\" (Prep 2:16). Torqua's famous, \"Across the heath rode Baron Devine, drawn by the mutant silver steeds of Anthonium\" (Orlando Inflamed 12:19) finds echo in Domingo's \"Off the dune leaped Sarge Devine to slay the mutant silver-stealing thieves\" (Prep 7:84). The ordeal of Baron Rothbart (Liberation of Mars 13 19) prefigures the even more brutal ordeal of Capt. Cuthbert (Prep 9:5-32). The challenge of the evil Lord Damnitz to the \"sturdy, unmoved, infinitely proud and patient\" Orlandans (Orlando Beyond 6:73) is matched by the challenge of the evil Arch Alien Dampt to the \"sturdy, unmoved, infinitely patient and vengeful\" A-Corps (Prep 17:42).\nIt was Fitz-of-All-People (whose generation, after all, never knew the enthusiasm of the Brigades era) who insisted that \"in spite of its great merits the Preparation can hardly be considered a true epic, neither spiritually nor in design, neither formally nor in effect.\" It was the brutal Melibea uprising of `007 that compelled Fitz to redeem his opinion. \"I know of no other work,\" he then swore, \"which more highly exemplifies the noble spirit of the human race than The Preparation of the Mining Planets, and which fulfills so completely and wholeheartedly the standards, requirements and traditions of heroic epic poetry.\nKtavono investigated the alien elements in the technique of the poem, in rhyme schemes, rhythmic segues and allomorphic tropes, and sought insights into the aliens' life-style, clothing, political and social organization, economic activity and religion. Of the latter, Domingo's description of what he terms their \"feral dreamscape\" is now a classic: \"In the hands of invisible masters, in the arms of invisible parents, wrapped in invisible blankets, asleep in intangible cradles. Yet the cradles do rock.\nIn the vocabulary of the poem are indeed alienisms but are often allo-planetic. Nouns such as knth, ptoma, atmn, which in the poem dot the landscape of Fides and are said to be of such significance to the Fidei, are not their talk at all, but derive from the pup-talk of the aliens on Chaco. There are many such allo-planetisms.\nThere are also occasions when Domingo passes up the chance to use an alien term in a genuine alien context, apparently doubtful his audience could, or would want to, understand. One example is the bitterness of the pack leader Akhts as he turns from watching the strip mining: \"A dog has pissed on my planet.\" Not only were dogs unknown to Akhts, but so was the concept of \"planet.\"\nKtavono doubts the names Domingo gives to the rare alien deemed worthy of a name -- Akhts, Xka, Salinch, Damtp, etc. --were names at all, were even alien. She suspects they were chosen or invented for euphony, onomatopoeia or the veering of the beat. They may thus give valuable clues to the phonology of the Outer World dialects of that era. They may indeed be the otherwise unrecorded remnants of the vocabulary of Domingo's subculture.\nThe gaming tables and mellow sites of all worlds have always had their own jargon but have never been closed societies; linguists and other researchers are warmly welcomed. Not so the hermetic communities. The Bernardians were still active during that period, and terms from their secret prayers could have found their way into the everydaytongue of the mining stations and battle camps -- but indirectly, and perhaps with some distortion, simplification or inversion of their original hermetic significance. Considering this, it is possible the rare name Domingo gives to the rare alien deemed worthy of a name may have had specific physical, moral, psychological, satiric or ironic relevance for him and for those who shared his background. Since the records are vague and the Bernardians' successors retain their secrets, we can do little to clarify things. We face the same blank wall as with Kawamoto's Battle of the Urns, where the innocent hero must contend with the seven oddly-named warriors Akron, Bravo, Charlie, Dingbat, Extra, Fungus and Grunt.\nKurath finds the understandably morose descriptions of the morose geography of some of the mining planets to be evidence of the poet's preoccupation with realism. Other critics, such as Royce and Edel, consider them but thinly veiled conventions, essentially the same modular phrases inserted into many a mass-produced, so-called literary epic. Only partial support for this is offered by Ja Sri: \"Domingo may have been entranced, as we all are, by the silver lakes, the bronze hills, the waves of gray and auburn sand, but his language had evolved elsewhere. His description of Neruda's moon setting behind the mountains (`a dragon's egg kissing a woman's breast') must derive from the experience of a far different planet, for neither Neruda's moons nor its mountains know such contours.\nFor Penargh, who believes honesty and exaggeration need not be antithetical, \"It's as if the poet sees through the superficial ugliness of his mission and venue to the underlying nobility of his goal, the enrichment of the human planets. Nay, their very survival.\" Elsewhere: \"He lifts the mining planets to a higher zone of beauty and imagination.\nSan-chei, in his No Dreams for Iapetus, claims to share with Domingo \"a certain visceral inclination towards the realistic,\" but in his duties as licensed critic he applies the G standard: How does this work of art improve upon life? Does it tell us what we would like to hear? Does the artist make full use of his powers or is he falling free?\nThis opposes, in effect, the positivist approach of Huygens (labeled negativist by his detractors) which applies the L standard: How does this conform to objective reality? Does it hold to what we already know and want more of? Does it steady us in a slippery universe?\nSan-che adds that a clear-headed evaluation of the artistry of the Preparation is hampered by the reader's all-too-human tendency to take sides, whether with the Brigades against the aliens, or with the aliens against the Brigades, or with certain aliens (perhaps those of Titus and Chaco) against the Brigades, or with the Brigades against certain aliens, usually those of Melibea.\nAmong the more recent critics, Jaipuru detects the influence of Domingo on Vantes, Seifert, the Barrel Poets and (strangely enough) the Quiet Ones. He applauds Domingo's \"sympathy for the innocent savage corrupted by civilization.\" Jaipuru explains the only way Domingo could save the aliens on Rimbaud and Lethe was to destroy them before civilization could, in the most honorable fashion then permissible. Domingo realized, insists Jaipuru, that for the aliens of those planets, life under humans would have been sheer Hell. (In Domingo's subculture, Hell was the destination of those who caused or permitted pain to their fellows.) For someone as compassionate as Domingo this was intolerable.\nThe learned Father Briscoe of the Universidad Dominicana-Jesuita de Callisto finds \"un toque renacentista\" in the poem, \"con su espiritu de cara frente a lo desconocido, iunto con su aire de libertad dentro de la ierarquia,y ademasy sobre todo en su estilo amplio, natural, soberbio, sin arcaismos muy obvios ni trasposiciones chocantes, o sea, requete-artisticas.\" As Mende, Wysse and Singh point out, the good Father's interpretation of the controversial term renacentista is too broad. He follows his Order's policy of claiming as Renaissance any movement of a planet's society out of illiteracy. Secular scientists are more restrained.\nOberon lists as a strong point Domingo's intense involvement in his subject matter (one would expect that) as opposed to the Bard of the Hurons, who merely observed and described. The comparison is unfair; the final version of The Striped Flag came centuries after the Bard's death, enough time to shed the clues of his \"intense involvement.\"\nOn the other hand, notes Brijn, \"Domingo knew how to roll words permanently on acetate and polyasphaltine and thus, as well as participant and poet, was his own final editor. His work has not been victimized by generations of polishers who polish away the glow. In contrast, The Striped Flag began to lose its primeval luster once it left the Bard's hands.\"\nFor Dwine, Brijn's is a \"pseudo-evaluation, nothing but a cheap nod to a fellow chauvinist's vanity in the guise of a tribute to artistic integrity and individualism. The Huronic work was improved over the generations by the careful removal of extraneous detail, anachronisms and minor elements that once may have had significance but which later ages found meaningless; and by the careful process of converting elements linked to a fixed time and place into elements relevant to all times and all places. The Yankees, for example, are more relevant to us today than they ever were to their contemporaries.\"\nIn reference to Domingo's style Ktorris observes, \"He's certainly not Carthusian [indeed, since Carthus was only three years old when the Preparation was published] despite similarities in the use of hyperbole, hyperbaton, syllepsis, syncope, synecdoche, metonymy, irony and metaphor, all part of the shared tradition of the Outer Worlds. He seems more Carthusian than most of Carthus' contemporaries and successors but only in technique; in philosophy, sexual attitude and self-presentation before Nature, there is Space between them.\nPriam reflects modern taste -- or weariness -- when he hesitates before what for him is the complicated disposition of rhymes and rhythms in the Preparation, \"which oblige a constant, mostly unconscious, effort to pay attention,\" perhaps analogous to the restlessness of the ancient bard's audience. Priam claims that though Domingo displays more architectonic vigor than others of his guild, it is wasted on us. We may still enjoy heroic epics but we live in a different age (some of us, in fact, have seen more than one) and seek new words and voices, such as Rhode offers in the recent Junqle of Marras, which includes, in both sight and sound editions, a newly developed musical instrument for use with the poem.\nDespite such innovations the ancient iangis is rare, and readers of taste and fortitude long for sterner stuff, for kidney pie instead of fingertips. When the pulse beats thus, one reads Domingo and strides, clanking, onto an alien planet.\nA.Y.

Pulling my mind together, I stumbled to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and looked apprehensively within. I am not the best of housekeepers, and my wife is less so, but I located the milk without resorting to a seeking spell, and filled the bottle with practiced skill. A small spell warmed it, and I was on my way to the bedroom in less than a minute.\nErika was sitting up in the crib, her crying stopped now as it was clear that she had my attention. The scent which assailed my nostrils as I bent over her nearly brought tears to my eyes. The milk could wait.\nSal insisted there was something intrinsically wrong with changing diapers by magic, but Sal wasn't around, and her quirks were not of immense concern to me at the moment. The diapers disintegrated at my mental urging, and fresh ones slid from the box to my hand at my call. Erika was of course delighted; her age was not yet sufficient to notice anything wrong with diapers levitating; with luck she never would. I am probably the most powerful wizard of the Web, the only likely competition being my wife Sal. Erika would probably surpass us both when she reached the age that we could teach her. The diaper catastrophe solved, I urged the bottle on my child and helped her with the apparently difficult task of keeping it in her mouth.\nWhen the phone rang some ten minutes later, Erika was deeply asleep. Sal would have accused me of a sleep spell, but since I could do them without gestures or words, it would be difficult to prove. In any case, Sal was on the other end of the line when I picked it up.\n\"Carl? I just got a call from the police station. Jeremy says you should go to the morgue and ask about the dead wino they brought in last night. He sounded scared.\"\nJeremy was one of the few people who knew our abilities. Wizards are rare on Earth, the Mages' Council requiring secrecy of them. However, I've been known to train the occasional person in a few small spells, in case I should need their help in the future. Jeremy was such a one.\nI pick my people well and train them better; it would take more than a small problem to frighten them. And large problems could take more than a few minutes for me to solve.\n\"All right. Can you come home and watch Erika?\"\n\"I'll be there in half an hour.\" There was a click on the other end of the line.\nBetter than her word, Sal was home in twenty minutes. Her long black hair flew wild as the business suit she wore shifted and changed into more casual clothing. I cast the reverse spell a few minutes later and was out the door.\nThe Dodge truck in the driveway shone like new; Sal must have had it washed earlier in the morning. I hopped behind the wheel and was halfway into the city when I realized I had no clue where the morgue was. A phone booth rectified this fairly quickly; there was a brief delay until I found its listing under \"Funeral Services.\" I meditated on the oddly-placed listing until I walked in the door of the morgue.\n\"Carl Moonsente. I have an appointment with the director.\" I used my real name on the off chance that Jeremy actually had made me an appointment. The barely audible word of command at the end of the sentence was on the more likely chance that he had not.\nHe hadn't; the technician smiled awkwardly. \"I'm afraid the director doesn't actually work here, he's at the office downtown. No one told us you were coming, but if you'll tell me what you'd like...\"\n\"I need to see the wino you brought in last night. I understand there's something a bit...\" I paused meaningfully, not knowing my meaning, \"unusual about him.\"\nThe technician knew. \"That's for sure. Come along.\"\nHe led me into the interior, slid a tray out of the wall, pulled back the cloth covering the body.\nIt looked dead, but little more than that, save that the eyes were sunken more than I might expect. I looked encouragingly at the technician.\n\"So what do you know so far?\" I had no clue what was unusual about this corpse, but if I alerted the technician to my ignorance he'd probably develop a suspicion that would take more than a word of command to undo. Luckily, he was a naively trusting soul.\n\"Only what you do -- his brain is missing completely. Not a cell of it left so far as we can tell. And there's no mark on him anywhere. It's spooky, is all I can say. But what's even spookier...\" His voice lowered. \"We brought in another one just like him, from the same alley, just this afternoon. And Central had one last week, from the same place.\"\n\"Any thoughts on what it might be?\" I was as clueless as they were. It was quite clear why Jeremy had given Sal a call.\n\"I think it might be some kind of disease that acts really fast, dissolving the brain.\"\nI shook my head. \"Even if it dissolved, it would have to go somewhere.\"\nHe nodded, shrugged. I decided not to push my luck.\n\"Well, thank you for your time. You've been a great help in my investigation. We'll let you know what we find out.\" He didn't ask who \"we\" were, which was fine with me since it was a lie anyhow. He pushed the corpse back into the wall with something like relief. I have to admit I wasn't terribly thrilled either.\nEarly evening found Sal and I at the alley where the bodies had been found. It had been cordoned off with yellow \"police investigation area, do not cross\" tape, which we ignored. The alley itself made a sharp bend, hiding its contents from view of the street. If muggers could have designed an alley, this would be it. In our case, though, the lack of visibility was of considerable aid. As soon as we could not be seen, we began protection spells.\nProtection magic is a strange art. The usual case is to \"weave\" a mesh of the particular protections you need; when the shield is triggered, it flashes a metallic blue and prevents the entry of whatever you have it guarding against. However, Sal and I weren't sure what we needed protection against, so we each put up a \"generic\" shield, literally millions of protection shields interlaced, allowing only air, some light, and our clothing to contact us. This gave us a cobalt blue aura as thousands of dust molecules, small insects, television and radio waves, and the like were repelled. To an observer, we would glow brilliantly. The more serious problem, of course, was the effort required to keep up such an arsenal of protections. Because of a magical accident earlier in my life I could cast spells on some sort of \"universal\" energy source, but all other wizards, Sal included, became tired quickly as the spell sapped their strength. I could not maintain her shield; for my power to get to her she would have had to allow magical penetration of her shield, and it was not at all clear that magic wasn't exactly what we needed protection against. There was a definite time limit to her participation in this investigation.\nThe glow helped by providing illumination, bathing the whole place in an eerie glow. I am, to understate the matter considerably, not comfortable in the dark; I added a beam of pure white light, casting it here and there.\nDown the alley from us was a stack of garbage, obscuring a small section of the alley; the rest was clearly visible, and just as clearly empty. I gestured to Sal, she nodded and moved back a bit. I gathered energy, wrapped it carefully around the garbage stack, and lifted it twenty feet in the air. Sal wrapped a binding spell around mine. The instant the stack was secure, I flashed my light back to the now-revealed alley.\nWe were clearly not the first people to ignore the police warning tape. A young man wearing a black leather jacket lay on his back in the alley, hands covering his face. He didn't more as I approached, a mental scan gave me nothing. He was dead.\nSal beat me to him, pulled back his hands, stiffened suddenly. Something small and dark flashed between them, a piece of night attempted to grab onto her face.\nIt was a bad choice; Sal's reaction was instantaneous; a blast of fire that wrapped the small speck and hurled it toward the alley wall.\nI reached it a moment later, dousing the flames with a thought. In my light, the creature resembled nothing more than a piece of black fluff, about a hand-width wide. Sal joined me at my side. \"Looks like a tribble.\"\n\"Indeed. It appears dead now, though.\" I confirmed this before letting my protections drop. I picked it up carefully, though there was little enough left after Sal's attack.\nIt was unlike any creature I has seen in my fairly wide experience. Teeth protruded from beneath, and a gentle static flowed about it, causing its singed hairs to rise and fall despite its lifeless state. Of eyes I could find nothing left, suggesting a magical tracking of its victims. The only thing certain about the body was that it felt somehow wrong, carrying an aura of places just around the corner but infinitely far away. It was clearly a creature of another world, and I needed to know where it came from. I sat down, holding it carefully in my hand.\nClosing my eyes, I let my mind drift. Darkness flowed over and through me, spinning and resolving into tiny, star-like points of light. I waited until the stars filled the sky, then lowered my mental vision to the ground. A river of stars flowed by me, millions of tiny glowing dots, swirling like eddies of water. I splashed with my mind, briefly disrupting the flow, then again, a complicated pattern, each break almost immediately vanishing into the river's course. After a time, I waited.\nAnother presence joined me--a council wizard who had served his apprenticeship with me. I called him Fireflower, as did everyone else, not only because his real name was difficult to pronounce, but in honor of a beautiful pyrotechnic display which had been his first mastered spell.\nFireflower took a few moments to orient himself, then spoke in eloquent, wizardly fashion.\n\"Whatcha need this time?\"\nI flashed him a mental picture of the creature we had killed. \"Do you know what this is? Killed one of them on Earth, don't think it belongs here.\"\n\"It certainly doesn't. Eats brains, no? The Council discovered them a couple years ago trying to open a faster gate to Carcigena. They're nasty little things, almost completely unintelligent, and nearly impossible to put a control spell on. We just slammed the gate shut and blasted the suckers that got through. Not before they'd killed a couple of the guards, though. Certainly not intelligent enough to open gateways themselves. Somebody summoned it, sure as...\" he paused, searching for an idiom.\nI let my breath out in a short sigh. The last thing I wanted to deal with was a hostile Mage. The last one had almost destroyed the Council and several worlds. \"Who isn't there right now, Fireflower? One of the Council gone bad again?\"\n\"Everyone's accounted for, Carl. We've been in meeting for several days. But there's a much more likely explanation. Opening the gate to their world was trivial; even a non-Council wizard could open it. Maybe it could even be done by accident.\"\nI smiled at the term \"non-council wizard.\" In the past such a person would have been called a renegade, but I was not technically a Council wizard myself, and Fireflower wasn't going to offend me. Even if our friendship hadn't dictated politeness, the Mages' Council owed me too great a debt for taking care of the aforementioned rogue wizard.\n\"You think a normal, off-the-street, untrained person could do it? I'd be more inclined to think wizard.\"\n\"Me, too, but keep possibilties open. We'd probably know about any practicing wizards beyond the medicine-man stage. What are you going to do about it?\"\n\"I guess I'll keep a watch on gate openings to Earth. Ask the Council not to come here for a while -- I don't want to be tracking the wrong people.\"\n\"Are you and Sal really powerful enough to monitor an entire world?\"\n\"Of course not. That's why you're going to come help us.\"\nFireflower gave a short laugh. \"Teach me to open my mouth. Need anybody else?\"\n\"Not if they're in Council. Although what you people find to talk about for five days a month escapes me entirely.\"\n\"Mostly rumors about you.\"\nIt wasn't a surprise. \"Probably as common as Elvis's picture in the tabloids.\"\n\"They'd still like you to come back, you know.\"\n\"I know. But I'm a father now, and I can't afford to be off gallivanting about the Web. If Erika wants apprenticeship, I'll be back when she's twelve. Until then, I'll keep my red, thank you.\" Red robes were the mark of an \"independent\" wizard. Sal wore the black-and-silver, but was barred from council meetings because of her relationship with me.\n\"I didn't really expect you to change your mind. I'll meet you at your house in a few hours.\"\n\"Make sure it's more than two. If you beat us there, you'll scare the living daylights out of the babysitter.\"\nI got a faint affirmative, and Fireflower's mental presence faded from the river.\nI opened my eyes. Sal was sitting across the alley from me, her face a mask of boredom. She brightened when I spoke.\n\"Fireflower recognized it, doesn't think it could have gotten here without a summoning or a gate accident. I'll tell you about it on the way home.\"\nFireflower made an impressive entrance. A darkening of the air in my living room was the first sign, followed a moment by the \"whoosh\" of air sliding between two worlds. Light spun on darkness, and Fireflower was there. He wore silver and black robes, his ebony skin almost lost in it's folds.\nErika was delighted, reaching out to tug on his robes. Fireflower adjusted his balance and swept her into his arms, barely managing a nod at Sal and myself until after a major conversation with my delighted child. From somewhere in his robes he produced a small, brightly colored rattle, brilliant hues magically swirling in time to its tiny musical notes.\nAfter an interval, he seated himself, not relinquishing his hold on the child. His grin faded somewhat as he faced us.\n\"You know this may be a pointless effort? There are, what, five billion people on this planet? And we're supposed to pick out a single wizard?\"\nSal smiled. \"You enjoy a challenge, remember? Besides, the person we're looking for is probably in the vicinity of the city.\"\n\"Which doesn't exactly help. New York has a sizeable population itself.\" Fireflower shrugged. \"But then, I have nothing better to do.\"\n\"It's a good thing you're so committed to the cause,\" I said cheerfully. \"Shall we begin?\"\nHe nodded. \"Will Erika behave herself?\"\n\"Usually not. I'll put her away.\" I lifted her from Fireflower's arms, carried her to the bedroom.\n\"Don't you DARE put a sleep spell on her!\" Sal's voice carried from the living room, along with Fireflower's chuckle. Shaking my head, I put Erika in the crib. Obeying the letter if not the spirit of the law, I wove a sleep spell around the rattle, placing it in the crib next to her.\nAlmost immediately, she picked it up, dropping into a deep slumber a few seconds later. Satisfied, I re-arranged the blankets to be sure she'd be warm enough, then returned to the living room.\nSal and Fireflower sat on the floor, their eyes closed, their breathing deep and regular. I joined them, careful not to disturb their meditation. Moments later I was with them in a completely different sense.\nOur minds slid out over the city, looking for unusual activity. The actual spells were not complicated, but the process was. We were looking for emanations of power or a gateway to another world. Unfortunately the background noise in a major city is considerable.\nThree times I felt an outflow of magic, three times tracked it to someone dying, their life flowing out in a burst of energy. In no case was the energy gathered, rather it escaped into the general environment. This particular feature of human death was abused in innumerable worlds of the Web; since personal stored of energy were quickly depleted, killing a human or other intelligent creature released a sizable amount of energy which could be harnessed by a wizard. The Mages' Council expressly forbid such activities, of course, but they happened nonetheless. It was just one of the myriad ways in which my profession makes a nuisance of itself across the multitude of worlds.\nI kept looking. After an hour or so, I felt Sal's mind touch mine, Fireflower's a bit later.\n\"Find anything?\" I asked.\n\"Only that you live in a particularly violent city.\" Fireflower was a inured to such things, but the disgust was still present in his voice. \"There's enough energy out there to disintegrate a small mountain, but no one's grabbing it.\"\n\"I found another one of those mind-eating creatures. I killed it.\" Sal's voice was weary. \"I'm going to roam out a bit further for the next hour.\" Her contact shivered, vanished.\n\"Probably not a bad idea,\" Fireflower said. \"I'll help her. You keep checking the city proper.\" He broke contact, too.\nI slid back into the city, following a couple of likely leads which led nowhere. I was just about to start my search over when a brilliant neon arrow flashed in my mind. I followed its path out of town, past the suburbs, to a small forested grove littered with tiny mind-patterns, all matching the mind-eater we'd killed earlier. Something else was there, too, the subtle hint of alien power.\nI snapped my eyes open. \"Nice job, Sal! Let's go.\" Both Sal and Fireflower were already on their feet.\n\"What do we do about Erika?\"\nI considered. It would be too dangerous to bring her with us, but there was little chance of getting a babysitter at this moment in time.\n\"Monitor that power for a while. I'll take her to day-care.\"\nSal looked at me strangely, then shrugged.\nI stepped into the bedroom, lifted Erika from the crib, shook her gently to wake her up. Pulling her close to me, I pulled darkness around myself.\nThrough the enveloping darkness thin red lines could be seen. We drifted through space, past several of the lines. I found the one I wanted, followed it until it began to wrap over itself in a huge spiral, forming a tunnel several times my own height. We flew down the tunnel, faster and faster, until a dot of white light at the end grew to engulf us, and I stepped onto a stone floor in a room with no doors.\nA large stone table filled the majority of this vast room, around it were seated fifty or sixty men, all dressed uniformly in black and silver robes. My own attire had changed during the transit to flowing red robes. I had also changed Erika's diapers to match.\nThe men looked up as one, whatever they had been discussing a moment before gone. I waited for them to make their move. They didn't. Seconds grew into a distinctly uncomfortable pause.\nFinally, the man at the head of the table stood, slowly. His name was Miren. He had a flowing white beard, wrinkled skin, and eyes that could only be described as dead. A recent tragedy had deprived him of both his wizard's immortality and much of his power; he was emotionally and psychologically crippled. Still, he was Miren, worshipped as a god on eight worlds, head of the Mages' Council of Somdor, the man whose words were the final judgement of any wizard who dared cross the Council's wishes. He was the man who had brought me, a homeless orphan, to another world, and trained me to be the wizard I was now. As he looked at me now though, it was unclear what he thought.\nThe men around the table waited. They were the most powerful group ever assembled, wizards from two hundred Web worlds, judge, jury, and all too often executioner of governments and people on almost a thousand of those worlds. Their combined might could remove a planet from existence, create a new form of life, summon forth or create nearly any object imaginable. I was not sure they'd be equal to the task I needed, however.\n\"I need you to take care of Erika for a few hours.\"\nMiren stopped his forward motion, shook his head twice as if to clear his ears, and considered.\n\"Okay.\" A voice spoke from the table rather than Miren. I turned.\nJ.R.R Tolkein forever changed Earth's perceptions of wizards. Gandalf was a tall, white-bearded old man in flowing robes, carrying a bent staff of rune-inscribed wood. I have only known one wizard like that in my entire experience, and it was he who stood. However, Antony bowed and grinned crookedly at me, ruining the image entirely.\nI considered in turn. Antony's mind had been fractured trying to close a gate to a hostile world known as Caligan, and though he had made some progress since then, he was still prone to fits of bizarre behavior. His malady was one no amount of magic would ever heal; he had been touched by intelligences so alien to our own that full rational thought of either form would now forever be denied him. On the other hand, the entire Council would be watching him, and I hoped I would only be gone for an hour or two. Antony needed my trust as much as I needed a babysitter. I carefully handed Erika to him.\n\"She's been fed, so you just have to keep her out of trouble for a while. I'll be back in a few hours.\" Antony nodded as he always did when receiving instructions. From previous experience, I knew there were almost even odds that he understood. Still not sure of my choice, I turned and pulled the darkness of the Web about me just as Miren finally spoke.\nI'm not sure what he said, but it might have been \"Good luck, Carl.\"\nSal and Fireflower were waiting impatiently in the driveway. Sal's eyes were closed, they opened at my footsteps. \"The power source is getting stronger. I'm fairly sure that it's a gate of some sort, and it's opening again.\"\n\"Then let's get on it.\" I hopped into the truck, Fireflower behind me. Sal sat next to me, closed her eyes, and pointed west. I turned the keys and we were off.\nIt's worth mentioning that I didn't have a clue how to drive a car. I was taken from Earth as a child, and returned only recently as a wizard; I never had any particular need for a driver's license in the worlds where I spent most of my apprenticeship years. I drove with a combination of Sal's help, some limited experience, and magic. The result wasn't too bad, and it usually got me where I wanted to go.\nThis time I got only five miles from home before a siren sounded behind me. Cursing softly, I pulled the side of the road. Beside me, Sal opened her eyes and spoke softly.\n\"Make this fast -- that gate is fully open.\"\nA police officer walked up to the window, which I rolled down.\n\"What's the problem officer?\" I noticed his gun was in his hand.\n\"You're the problem. I clocked you at almost two hundred miles an hour. Would you step out of the car please?\"\nI heard Sal gasp at the number, and ignored her.\nI pointed back onto the road suddenly. \"Officer! That car's speeding! You'd better catch it! I'm not important!\" I placed a word of command at the end of each sentence.\nHe struggled with the magic, but my claim was too ludicrous; he broke the enchantment and raised his gun.\n\"I said out of the car, now!\"\nSal's eyes were wide, and I doubted that it was the policeman who caused such an effect. Something was happening with the gate, and I was wasting time.\nI reached out quickly, almost carelessly with my mind, shaping a ball of flames and heat, pulled it into this world and rolled it under the unoccupied police car behind me.\nThe explosion was spectacular; spectacular enough that the officer turned suddenly to look at the remains of his vehicle. I put the truck into gear with my hand while pushing it forward with my mind. By the time the officer knew what had happened he was clearly visible in my rear-view mirror. He chose not to shoot because of the traffic on the road.\n\"What's up?\" I asked Sal.\n\"I don't know. I've never felt anything like that gate before. It's either very large, or it's opening across a very large distance. In any case, it's only barely under control. Whoever's opening it doesn't know what he's doing.\"\nFireflower made a few quick gestures, but I heard a siren again before I could tell what he was doing.\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Fireflower said. \"It's us. I put a police-car disguise on the truck. It's not very good -- I've not seen too many of them. But at 200 miles an hour you're going to be a blur anyway.\"\nSal's knuckles were white.\n\"Do you want me to slow down?\"\n\"Yes, but we don't have time. Turn north as soon as you're able.\" She began weaving protection spells around the truck as I scooted in and out of traffic lanes. Cars in front of me were getting out of my way as best they could, though by the time they heard my sirens or saw my lights I was almost on top of them anyway.\nA highway turnoff went north; I took it. Vehicles scattered.\n\"Just like an arcade game,\" I commented. Sal let out a sound that wasn't quite a moan.\n\"I don't want to see a flashing 'Game Over,' Carl.\" She cast a short spell, pushing a car in front of me to the left lane. I took the newly opened lane and sped by.\n\"Keep that up. Fireflower, navigate!\"\nHe was already doing so. Following his direction, I turned back to the west, depositing me on a little-used road. We were clear of the city now, entering a forest. The road lost its paving, began to turn frequently. I was forced to slow down.\n\"North again!\"\nI looked, but could see no road leading the direction I needed to go. \"How far?\"\nFireflower considered. \"About a mile.\"\nI brought the truck to a stop on the side of the road. \"Let's do it on foot.\"\nWe stepped out of the truck and entered the forest at as quickly as possible in the dark. None of us suggested a light, we knew too little about what was ahead to advertise our position so blatantly. Almost simultaneously, we put up protection spells, toning them to the maximum performance we could achieve without glowing. Sal's clothing shimmered briefly, weaving itself into insubstantiality, then to silver-and-black mage's robes. None of us ceased our half-run into the forest.\nFireflower, in better shape than I, fanned out to the left, his black skin and robes causing him to vanish almost instantly into the forest. Sal noticed and increased her pace, silently disappearing into the forest on my other side.\nI slowed to give them time to get ahead, and immediately wished I hadn't. I'm not fond of darkness at any time; deep in unknown woods facing a definitely magical and probably hostile force, I was positively terrified. Every patch of shadow seemed to me to hide a living form, clumps of darkness seemed to move at the edges of my vision, freezing into immobility as I turned my head. Although the night was warm, my skin felt cold, the slightest contact of the wind like the pressure of an unseen hand.\nBehind me, a twig snapped. Perhaps it was one of the \"sounds of nature\" that woodland experts refer to when they're in safe, well-lit houses at high noon; now it was the sound of a danger I didn't care to face. My pace went from a slow walk to a full-out run.\nFour minutes is a speedy time for the mile run on level, unobstructed ground. I covered the distance through dense forest in just more than six , aided by magic and fright. Tree limbs snapped out of my way as I ran, undergrowth tore itself from the earth, pulling aside to let me path.\nOne root failed to observe my magical compulsion; by the coincidence that seems to be the only inflexible natural law, my foot met it. My body lifted, fell, and slid in a brilliant flash of cobalt blue to the edge of a clearing.\nA bonfire flamed within. On the other side a giant cross was set into the ground upside down, a decapitated goat suspended from it in a position no one would mistake as natural. Forty or fifty men in white robes stood around the clearing, thirteen of them in a smaller ring around the fire and an alter. One of the thirteen held a curved sacrificial knife, and was bent over a boy of perhaps ten lying on the alter.\nEvery one of them turned to look at me as I flashed. Unhurt, I got quickly to my feet.\n\"Good evening, Gentlemen. Someone ordered a pizza?\"\nThe one with the knife narrowed his eyes. \"Get him!\"\nSubtlety, I determined, was not this man's strong point. Several of the robed men started toward me. I held my ground and spoke.\n\"No, get him!\" I pointed, and added a word of command. As one, the body of men turned and charged the one with the knife.\nHe looked confused a moment, then raised his arms to his sides and spoke a few words. The might have been backwards Latin; on the other hand they may have been complete gibberish. In any event, the flames behind him roared to new heights. His attackers froze, looking around in some confusion.\nThe Mage's Council has hotly debated the existence of God and Satan. It was generally accepted by the council that though either might exist, they tended not to interfere frequently in the affairs of men. I considered it unlikely that the High Priest had actual help from the Prince of Darkness; still it was undeniable he had tapped some source of power.\nI used their confusion as best I could. \"Leave us! Return to your homes and never come back here!\" The syllables afterward rang with uncontrolled power; I was not attempting subtlety any longer. Anyone who might have wished to confront me changed his mind quickly. The clearing emptied except for the High priest, the twelve others in his circle, and the boy on the altar.\nI turned my attention to the last of these. A couple seconds observation convinced me that the boy was still breathing; the red line of blood down his chest appeared to be superficial.\n\"Let the child go.\" I strode forward as I talked; obviously not the move the priest expected. But he held his ground.\n\"You misunderstand; he is one of ours. I have cut his chest, placed the devil in him. He now knows and will obey his master in this world.\" As if to confirm this, the boy stood up and stepped to the priest's side.\nI shook my head. \"You shall not have this child. I claim him in the name of our Father in heaven.\" I slipped a full protection spell around the boy, enhancing mine at the same time until we both glowed with a brilliant blue aura.\nThe priest attempted to reach through the spell, failed. He turned to me with an anger like none I had ever seen.\n\"Your power is as nothing before the might of Lucifer! Your death shall only begin your punishment, and the child shall be mine regardless!\"\nHe stretched out his hands toward me, and flames poured forth from them. My shield held, but just barely. I struggled to bring it back while the fire roared around me. This guy was playing with more power than I had expected.\nThe flames died, and I carefully stood as I had before they had begun, to make it appear that they had no effect whatsoever. One of the robed men slammed into me from the side; he stumbled away from a brilliant blaze of blue, holding a broken arm and just beginning to scream. His natural mental protections dropped from the pain; I pulled a sleep spell over his mind, and he slumped to the ground.\n\"Next?\" I said casually, wondering desperately how long it would take Sal and Fireflower to get here. Another of the robed men charged; I changed his robes to concrete and he stopped before he got close.\nThe priest walked toward me with his knife held in front of him. I let him. He swung his knife, I instinctively raised my arm to block the blow; it probably saved my life. The blade passed through my protection spell as though it weren't there, bit deeply into my arm.\nArrogance has gotten me in trouble before; this time it was going to get me killed if I didn't move. I dropped to the ground, rolled away. One of the acolytes, encouraged by his leader's success, drew his own knife and attempted to run it through me. I didn't play games; the acolytes robes blazed suddenly into intense flames. He dropped the knife and ran screaming from the clearing.\nI grabbed the knife with both hands, stretched it into a sword, stood. I attempted to ignite the high priest's robes as well, but failed. We both took a fighting stance as the remaining acolytes formed a ring around us.\nI took a good swing at him. My swordsmanship is nothing to write home about, but my weapon was longer than his by a good eighteen inches, and I was apparently faster. Still, he managed to block the strike, and my poorly-fashioned sword shattered at the shock.\nA blue-white flash of electrical energy darted from somewhere outside the ring, jumping down the priest's blade and slamming into his body with enough force to drive him backwards through the ring of acolytes, stopping against the altar. I didn't need Sal's shout of triumph to tell me that help had arrived.\nThe acolytes turned to face this new threat; four of them drew their ubiquitous knives and tried to run her down. I saw two of them encased in ice and a third one fending off a wooden staff that appeared out of nowhere to beat his head; then I jerked my attention back to my own aggressors. The five remaining acolytes decided to give the attack one more try. I selected one, grappled him to the ground, exchanged my image for his and let his compatriots beat him senseless while I slid out of the mass of men. A few gestures more and the ground began to swallow them up, stopping only when each man was trapped to his waist.\nSatisfied, I turned my attention back the priest. He had survived the shock, and aside from his now-straightened hair looked none the worse for wear. His eyes held raw murder, with that same strange intensity I had noted earlier. As soon as my image returned to normal he raised his arms in my direction.\nSome have said I don't learn from experience; this is blatantly false. I was already on the ground and rolling aside when the flames cut the air above me. I gathered my own fire and returned the gesture. It parted around him harmlessly, but the boulder that Sal rolled through his path didn't. He went down in a tangle of limbs. Sal was on him in a moment, a knife in her hands from somewhere.\nAbove her head, a pale sphere shimmered for a moment in the firelight, and a multitude of tiny voices filled my mind for a fraction of a second. Moments later the sphere shimmered again, larger and only inches from Sal's head.\n\"Sal! Dive!\" Even as I spoke she looked up and realized her danger. The high priest took this opportunity to kick her feet out from under her. They went down together. I lifted a knife from the ground and ran toward them, keeping beneath the flashing sphere.\nThe high priest wrested Sal's knife from her and swung. Sal rolled aside, the knife tangling itself in her robes. Before the priest could recover it, my own knife had slit his throat. I don't kill easily, I could see no choice this time.\nSal and I scurried away from the growing sphere as voices began again in my mind. I pushed them aside with some force.\nWe had made it about twenty feet from the sphere when I blacked out.\nDarkness filled my mind, a swirling, complete darkness of complete comfort. And somewhere in the darkness a million tiny voices were calling out to me, urging indecipherable actions...\nMy eyes snapped open at Sal's slap. She held my cut wrist in one hand, was weaving spells to stop the profuse bleeding. The high priest's knife wound slowly sealed itself, then closed.\n\"You've lost a lot of blood,\" she said with concern in her voice. \"I don't have time to do better than just stopping it now-- you'll have to be careful.\"\nI nodded and looked over her shoulder. The sphere was no longer flickering; instead it had grown to almost fifteen feet in radius, a blood-red sphere with black \"cracks\" that slid around it in apparently random patterns, vanishing and reforming slowly. And directly beneath it, bathed in a light blue aura, stood the boy from the altar. He was looking up into the sphere, his mouth open slightly. There was a brilliant cobalt light pouring off the protection spell, but it was weakening quickly.\nA ball of silver and black rolled under the sphere. Fireflower grabbed the unresisting boy in his arms just as the protection failed altogether and carried him rapidly to where Sal and I sat waiting.\n\"What the hell is that thing?\" Fireflower's black skin shone with a pale red in the light of the gigantic sphere.\n\"Caligan gate,\" Sal and I said together. I continued solo.\n\"The creatures on the other side 'speak' directly to minds. They cause death in the best case. Those less lucky go insane. Antony met one...\" I let the sentence trail off. All of us knew Antony's madness. \"If that gate opens completely, we're in serious trouble. So is this world, for that matter.\"\n\"The priest must have opened it by accident. None of the usual controls are there. I can't get my mind around it. Every time I try I hear voices laughing at me.\" Sal's voice was exhausted, her body looked worse.\n\"Shit!\" I said suddenly. \"Sal! Get that boy out of here! We can't protect him and still have any hope of getting that gate closed.\"\nI looked toward the various immobilized acolytes in the clearing. They had not had any protection; it was clearly too late. The two that still moved did so only to pull themselves into a ball and whimper. Sal grabbed the boy and fled the clearing.\nFireflower still looked relatively fresh; I felt like I would pass out again at any moment. I pictured a two-foot candy bar in my mind, made the appropriate gestures to bring it into reality. I consumed it as quickly as possible while Fireflower surveyed the gate.\n\"Well?\" I said when I had finished.\n\"Sal's right; it's uncontrolled.\"\n\"Okay, let's try to put a larger gate around it then, contain it. We might be able to force it closed by pulling the larger gate shut.\"\nFireflower looked at me askance. \"Not to be argumentative, Carl, but Miren once told us never to put a gate around a gate. He was quite firm about it.\"\nI shrugged. \"Do you have a better idea?\"\nI knew the answer, began my spell. Fireflower's mind joined mine, and together we began weaving a larger sphere around the smaller gate. By now there was enough power in the clearing that our work could be seen by the naked eye. White strands like gigantic spider webs coalesced into existence, threading through one another to form a pale glowing white sphere. Wizards often speak of \"weaving\" a spell; usually it's metaphorical, but here we were doing in reality.\nWhile we worked, a tinny laughter kept forming in the back of my mind, a million voices screaming with mirth. I pictured Antony with my mind, used the force of the memory to shove the voices into oblivion.\nThe last fragments of the spell slid into place. Fireflower looked at me for several long moments, then we wrapped out minds around the cloth we had created and pulled the gate tight.\nThe explosion was purely mental at first, a millionfold increase in the laughter, then the red gate consumed our white one; flashing outward to triple it's size. Fireflower and I turned and ran from the clearing, stopping a hundred yards later to look back.\n\"Whatta ya know? Miren was right!\"\nFireflower didn't seem amused by my comment. I didn't blame him; the sphere was now more than seventy yards in diameter, pulsing with light like some gigantic disembodied heart lit from the inside.\n\"Now what?\" Fireflower looked contemplative, but he had to be thinking the same thing I was; that gate was almost open, and completely out of our control. My eyes scanned it from top to bottom, looking for something, anything, that could help us close it. I found something else entirely.\nA figure bathed in blue light stood only a few feet from the sphere, indistinct because of the distance and the glow, but there was only one person on this world that it could be.\n\"What's Sal doing?\" I pointed. Fireflower looked at me with wide eyes; I returned the look. We started running at the same time.\nWe were thirty feet from the figure when it turned. It was a weathered old man, white beard flowing in the stiff wind that escaped the gate, holding a gnarled staff in one hand, my baby in the other.\n\"Antony! Get Erika out of here!\"\nHe appeared not to hear. I closed the distance faster than I have ever run. But there was nothing I could do. Erika was covered by Antony's protection spell; nothing I could do would obtain her unless Antony chose to give her up.\nI looked him in the eyes. There was no trace of sanity within; how he managed to keep up a protection spell was beyond me. His eyes stared past and through me.\n\"Carl!\" Fireflower's shout caused me to look up. One side of the gate was splitting, an ebony crack forming larger and larger. The gate was opening.\nI summoned fire, poured it through the crack in the gate, trying to reverse the flow of power. The crack slowed, stopped.\nI could not maintain both the flames and my protection spells for long. Fireflower added his force to mine. I broke off, repaired my protections, then replaced him as he did the same. We alternated for several minutes, but it was clear that Fireflower was tiring. Already the crack was beginning to split again.\nI turned to Antony, was surprised to see him staring right at me.\n\"I've kept her safe, Carl.\" His voice was almost, but not quite, that of a sane man. Laughter sounded in my mind; it was echoed in his eyes.\n\"Yes, Antony. Thank you. I can take care of her now.\"\nHe nodded, handed Erika to me. I wrapped my protections around her as well, noting that she was asleep and breathing easily. That had to be the result of a spell, since the howling wind around us would have woken the dead.\nI turned my gaze back to Antony. He had walked another ten feet forward, placed his hand on the surface of the sphere itself. I shouted for him to come back, but there was no way he could hear me over the roar of wind.\nFireflower staggered. He looked at me for a moment. \"I'm sorry, Carl. I'll bring help.\" He stepped across and out of my world.\nMy own fire could not keep the gate from opening any longer. Laughter filled my mind, but not the laughter of the Caligans. It was Antony's voice, magnified a millionfold by some spell.\nA tiny red creature with wings slipped from the gate, then another and then hundreds. No larger than wasps, they filled the sky with laughter and voices and crimson fire.\nIt was now a fight just to keep the protections strong enough to resist the Caligans' voices, protecting my child and I. As quickly as I could and still be sure of my footing, I began backing away from the gate. Cobalt blue almost completely obscured my vision.\nAntony's laughter increased in pitch; there was something soothing about it in the mere fact that it was human, though barely so.\nErika screeched suddenly, notifying me that she was awake. I ignored her, my spells were being broken down now faster than I could renew them. I had to put distance between myself and the gate. No longer able to move cautiously, I ran.\nA darkness at the edge of my mind threatened to drop me once more into unconsciousness. I slowed my pace, concentrated all my will on staying awake. My protections started to crumble, so I switched my mind back to protecting us.\nI dropped unconscious for a moment, but regained it before I struck the ground. Erika landed heavily to my side, but the mass of blankets appeared to protect her. I pulled her back to me, and started crawling away.\nSuddenly my protection spells sprang back to full strength, and Sal was at my side. She took Erika from my arms and helped me to my feet, pulling me further from the gate.\nAntony's laughter made me turn. He stood at the edge of the gate, half his body already in another world. The swarm of Caligans flowed by him, but he stepped into the gate, raising his arms as if to block their path.\nIt actually appeared to work. The Caligans continued to pour forth, but they did so through other cracks in the gate, avoiding Antony altogether.\nSome quiet voice in my mind spoke the impossible. Antony had listened to the voices of the Caligans for several minutes, had lived with the memory of those voices for two years. Perhaps he could do what a sane wizard could not.\nI pulled away from Sal, running back toward Antony. She followed for a few steps, then realized her protections would never hold. I tapped her mind briefly as I ran.\n\"I have an idea. Get Erika as far out of here as you can. I'll meet you in the Council chambers if this works.\" I didn't have the energy to say more; my protections were crumbling already, and I had only a few minutes to work.\n\"I love you. Don't kill yourself for a crazy old man.\" Sal's voice was like a beacon of energy; I increased my pace and made it to Antony's side as Sal vanished into another world. Carefully, I placed my hand on Antony's shoulder, trying my best not to startle him.\nAt the contact the inhuman laughter stopped, and my protection spells went from brilliant blue to completely invisible. Antony had somehow found or created an eye in this storm.\nI slid my mind into his, found only the shattered pieces which I had once tried to repair on a distant world. Now I merely tried to understand them, and realized that this would be the harder task.\nMinutes passed as I sorted, looking in mental crannies for the key to his insanity. I found only an overpowering will to survive that was in itself more powerful than sanity.\nWords from the physical, real world brought my awareness back.\n\"I understand,\" Antony said. His eyes were clear. \"You must get far away.\" There was no word of command on the sentance, but a sound of death that was as powerful. I ran for a hundred feet, turned and looked back.\nAntony's body was dissolving, turning slowly into light. When all that was left was his head, he turned back to me and laughed. The laughter continued until he was completely gone, and beyond.\nThe gate began to fade.\nThe Caligans who were free in this world turned back almost as one, their laughter and voices silent, rushing to recreate what Antony was tearing apart. It was a hopeless task; they fought against a power as implaccable as the insanity they had caused.\nIt took four minutes for the gate to vanish completely. The few Caligans still on this side dropped dead from the skies to the ground. I would have to return here in a day or two to remove the alien bodies before they were discovered.\nI spent a few long moments confirming that the gate was really closed, then stepped across the worlds to the Council Room. Fireflower and Sal were already there, Sal holding Erika in one hand and the hand of the Satanist's boy in the other. The room was full of silver-and-black wizards, their numbers declining quickly as they stepped toward Earth. I stopped the remaining ones with a few short words.\nSal smiled at me. The darkness closed in again, and this time I saw no reason not to let it come.\nChristopher Kempke is a dangerous, psychopathic Computer Science graduate\nstudent with too much time on his hands.

The trees covered over me until my shadow was no longer at my side. I stopped by a cool and bubbling stream to dampen my hands. The icy waters rippled under my touch. I sat down beside the brook against a rock to inhale the beauty around me. The trees about me rustled in a breeze that I could not feel on the floor of this great garden. The sunlight sparkled yellows and golds in shimmering beams between the trees.\nAs I got up, the shirt I wore felt damp from leaning on a small patch of moss on the stone. The dust fell from my pantlegs. I inhaled deeply and set off again.\nQuietly, I walked past a family of rabbits who were rummaging for edible leaves in the undergrowth. They watched me with silent curiosity that did not quiver until I had passed. I felt good about this.\nThe path I walked was not often walked by humans. Deer used it.\nI could hear the dove calling, and I followed. It was not long before I was at the edge of a great clearing. I spotted the dove to my left. I dropped noiselessly to my knees and gazed upon the beauty of the dove.\n``A-7 and stationary.''\nThe warbling from within this creature was as fascinating as anything I had ever witnessed.\n``Still there.''\nThe cocked-head movements of this little bird excited my interest.\n``Closing In.. CONVERGE! converge.''\nA passive relaxation soaked into my being.\n``Grab him!''\n``Why, sir?'' questioned Trooper A-35.\n``He cannot be here! No one can be here! Get him back inside.''\n``He isn't hurting anyone, sir.''\nIn a moment, fifteen men were around me. Two picked me up and walked me back to the prisoner transport.

Geographos, it was called, catalogue number 1620, one of the handful of asteroids that inhabit the inner solar system. Six months before I had never heard of it. But there I was, looking at it out of the forward viewport of an asteroid belt utility ship. Carlos was looking over my shoulder as we floated in the warm, nearly dark confines of the ship's control room. After a week or so of maneuvering we had matched velocities with the asteroid and had finally gotten close enough to see some of the fine details of it with the naked eye. We had been staring at it in silence for some time.\n\"Well, what do you think of it, Stephan?\" asked Carlos.\n\"Looks like a big overgrown peanut,\" I said, as we watched it rotate lazily.\n\"A peanut that has a date with destiny,\" he returned, with mock seriousness.\nI nudged him away with an elbow. \"We should get suited up and go have a look at it. Touch it, take measurements, get familiar with it,\" I said. \"Go see if Joanna wants to come along. I'll meet you in the workroom.\"\n\"As you say, Senor Perkins,\" returned Carlos, as he left the bridge.\nThe idea for this mad scheme that we were involved in was cooked up by someone named Charles Kelman of UCLA in about 1980, over a hundred years ago. The original paper can still be found in the files of the NASA museum, if you care to look. I've read it. There is little doubt that it was a tongue-in-cheek proposal by Kelman. In the same file with the proposal were several letters and memos addressed to him that contained criticisms from his peers. Their comments ranged from \"premature\" and \"outrageously innovative\" to \"preposterous\" and even \"criminally insane.\" I think his real purpose was to stimulate some discussion on how mankind might begin to exploit the resources of the solar system. Surely he never intended for anyone to try it! Unfortunately, events and human nature can conspire to make the damnedest things sound plausible.\nThe situation in Central America has never been stable, but this time the turmoil was even worse than usual. Threats by a new and belligerent government in Panama to disable the existing Panama canal probably had the most influence. More than threats, fact is, they actually closed it for nearly a year in 2045. Then they doubled the usage rates. Wealthy and powerful people got angry. Wheels were set in motion and the \"Columbia Canal Project\" was born.\nThe project was billed as the most spectacular engineering feat ever attempted by mankind. And so it was. The first time I heard of it I thought that it was some kind of joke. When I found out that they were serious, I shook my head in disbelief. There was only one possible explanation--that everyone involved was certifiably nuts! The plan was to build a new canal connecting the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean Sea. The area chosen was in the wilderness of northwestern Columbia, near the Atrato River. A peninsula sticks up out of Columbia there, a peninsula that eventually becomes Panama. There was only about 150 Km of land between the two bodies of water in this area, so the new canal wouldn't have to be too long. Up to this point everything was fine, but then things started to get scary. They were going to do the excavation by hitting the proposed site with a piece of an asteroid! Our asteroid, Geographos. It was hoped that the resulting impact would create a huge crater and would, in one unthinkable blast, do a job that would normally take years of heavy and dangerous labor. The enterprise was made to sound even more attractive by announcing that the metal content of this heavenly fragment would be worth in the neighborhood of 900 billion dollars! Dollars that would be a godsend to the beleaguered economies of Central and South America. No one had any suggestions on how this new supply of precious metals was to be obtained from its eventual ocean resting place, however. Isn't this starting to sound just a little nuts? To prove that there is no shortage of stupidity in high places, a joint committee of Central American and United States officials bought the deal, lock, stock and asteroid.\nThey wanted me because I'm damned good at astro-engineering and I have a lot of experience working in space. I'm the same Stephan Perkins that did most of the design work on the United States L-5 space colony. I was also good with people, usually, and this was going to require the coordinated efforts of many. At least we had the time we needed to iron out some of the problems. We began work on this project in 2048, nearly five years before the next close approach of Geographos.\nNot that we were likely to have any problems. I mean, all we were going to do was excise a chunk of rock about the size of a small midwestern town from this minor planetoid, alter its course to bring it within kissing distance of the earth, figure out some way to aim it at a specific target, and allow it to impact. No sweat, eh? How do you establish an acceptable margin of error for something like that? How do you go about reducing the stupefying velocity at which this \"impact projectile\" would be traveling? We had no idea of how this thing was going to behave when it made contact with earth's atmosphere either. We weren't going by the book, we were writing it! It's no exaggeration to say that the challenge was formidable; even the slightest miscalculation had the potential of ending in a horrible catastrophe. So, I got involved because I had to. I had to do what I could to insure that things wouldn't end up in a total disaster. I figured that they needed at least one person who knew what the hell he was doing!\nI tore my gaze away from the viewport. The vastness of space with its frosty dusting of tiny bright stars was a rich, dark tapestry and the slowly twirling asteroid suspended against this backdrop was a compelling, almost hypnotic, sight.\nAs I left the bridge for the workroom, I almost ran into Salazar in the corridor. Diego Salazar, from Columbia, the \"executive director\" of the expedition. A terrible choice, by any measure. He was a wealthy and powerful member of the canal committee who had been included on the mission at the last minute. To tell you the truth, the whole Salazar situation looked suspicious to me. The guy knew next to nothing about the engineering end of the project. His forte was politics and even though that was something he was damned good at, I found out early on that he had no idea how difficult this job was going to be. In addition, he was neither liked nor respected by any of the crew. By some kind of convoluted logic this made him the obvious choice to head the mission. None of this altered the basic fact that he was an idiot, and I thought that the ramrod tactics that he tried to use on me and the rest of the team were actually counterproductive. We needed him like we needed a hole in the airlock.\n\"Don't you think it's time to have a look at that asteroid, Perkins?\" he said. With his accent, he pronounced it \"pear-kins\" but he always spoke with rich full tones, as though he were making one of his political speeches.\n\"We were just on our way,\" I replied, pushing past him.\n\"Ah, I see,\" he said, \"Good, I shall observe you from the control room. Now that we are finally here it is vital that we make the best use of our time. Si?\"\n\"If you say so, Salazar,\" I continued down the corridor. That was his way, he stated the obvious and applied pressure when it wasn't needed. I always found an excuse to go somewhere else when he came in. From the first impression onward, my attitude towards him had been one of intense dislike. As you'll see, those instincts were well founded.\nAfter some idle chit-chat in the workroom while we put on our suits, we were off to our first close encounter with Geographos. That was a humbling experience! The ship was kept on a parallel course at a safe distance and we used a utility sled to go over to the slowly rotating asteroid. As we got closer we began to realize just how big it was. The books and our instruments said that it was about 2.2 km in length. Maybe so, but it sure seemed bigger than that when you got close enough to touch it.\nGetting on to it was tough. It wasn't enough that it rotated around its center, it had a slight wobble as well. You mounted it carefully, at the center of rotation. Once on, you could move out towards the slightly swollen ends. It had no noticeable gravity; a healthy sneeze was probably enough to impart escape velocity, so you were virtually weightless. As you moved outward, you had to cling tightly to its pocked and jagged surface because you picked up the same relative motions. By the time you were perched on the end you were rotating and wobbling right along with it. What a ride! You were also treated to a blinding view of the sun's searingly bright disk every few minutes. It took some real getting used to but we had little choice, there was work to be done.\nDismounting was the reverse process, carefully make your way back to the center and push off over to the sled. Carlos and I thought we were doing well merely to keep from flying off into space until we saw an unconcerned Joanna calmly going about the collection of samples for analysis. Not to be outdone, we checked our tethers, composed ourselves and set about determining the exact dimensions of our cosmic excavation tool.\nOur first order of business was to stop the spinning and wobbling motions. We would use some strategically placed rockets to accomplish this. Then, we would strap on the huge boosters that we had brought out with the belt ship and start to seriously alter its course and speed. Even though the size and mass of Geographos was far too much for the needs of our project, it looked like the best thing to do was to bring the whole asteroid back. The real fun would start when we began to approach Earth. That's when we were going to have to perform some difficult and intricate maneuvers. Here's how it was supposed to work. It had been determined that the smaller end of the \"peanut\" contained more than enough material to serve our purposes. We would cut through the asteroid near the slightly narrower \"waist\" area with a series of carefully placed explosive charges. After that, we would have to do some minor surgery to pare our chosen end down to the proper size and shape for the excavation job that was planned for it. Then we would use one of the same strap-on boosters to alter the course towards earth. Hopefully, we could \"skip\" it through the atmosphere once, or twice if we needed to, to scrub off some more of its unwanted velocity and to do some final shaping as well.\nWhile all this was going on, another team would take charge of the rest of the asteroid, the so-called \"tail section\". They would use the remaining booster to carefully \"park\" the tail section in the L-4 point of the earth-luna system. There it would be ready and waiting right in our neighborhood, so to speak. We could use it for another \"excavation\" project or, more likely, as building material for more orbital colonies or Lunar construction projects. Any construction material was welcome in space and Joanna's preliminary analysis had determined that Geographos was rich in all kinds of valuable metals.\nThe hardware and methods for manipulating and moving the asteroid were pretty well worked out, men had been \"mining\" the asteroid belt for years, but no one had ever had to contend with such high relative velocities before. In the belt things only move at about 5 km\/sec. Compared to that, Geographos was hauling ass!\nCarlos and I had sat up until the wee hours almost every \"night\" on the two-month trip out to the rendezvous with Geographos trying to determine what the best shape and mass of the final object should be. There had actually been several small asteroid \"drops\" done in the early part of the century. Maybe you've heard of Statler and Chin. They were a couple of borderline psychotics with forged scientific credentials who had somehow gotten permission to hit Mars with some small asteroids, just to see what would happen. It was kind of like turning a couple of small boys loose with a box of dynamite and a book of matches. Their masquerade lasted for nearly two years before they were found out and put away. They did take some nice pictures but both their measurements and their technique were, as you would expect, abysmal. In addition, the atmosphere and gravity of Mars were completely different from earth's. But this somewhat sketchy data was all that we had to go on. Of course, anything at all was a help. It was too bad that they had simply dropped the rocks directly, and hadn't tried to skip any of them through the atmosphere; we could have used the information. For us, such skips were vital because they would not only slow the thing down, but would allow us to get valuable data on how much mass we were going to lose when it made its final plunge through the atmosphere. More than once, I woke up in a cold sweat when I dreamed that we had miscalculated and instead of a new canal, we had created a sizeable new bay near San Francisco.\nDr. Carlos Monzon Cortez had been appointed to be my assistant and liaison with the committee. Born in Columbia and educated in the U.S., he was an excellent choice. He was dark and slender with black eyes and classic Latin good looks. By any standard, Carlos was a strikingly handsome man. His speech was very soft and polite, almost apologetic, but it was best to listen when he spoke because he always knew what he was talking about. Women found him irresistible, but he seldom took advantage of them; maybe that was part of his charm. He was particularly valuable because he was fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese, and communication between us and the committee on some very technical matters was necessary. Oh yes, he was also one hell of an engineer. I found him irresistible too; we quickly became good friends.\nEverything was going according to schedule until we had a meeting to discuss procedures and present progress reports. The meeting started out amiably enough but things soon took a nasty and unexpected turn. After some assorted small talk, Salazar made an announcement.\n\"We must begin placing the explosive charges tomorrow,\" he said. \"The asteroid is to be broken in two here, in deep space. We shall be bringing home only what we need of it.\"\nThere was a buzz of conversation. I was taken completely by surprise. \"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"I thought it was agreed that we would take the whole thing back!\"\n\"The plan has been changed,\" he replied.\n\"Changed?\" I said. \"By whom? Carlos and I weren't consulted about this.\"\n\"It was changed by the committee,\" he said. \"At my recommendation.\"\n\"Well, change it back,\" I said, my anger beginning to stir. \"We're missing out on a golden opportunity if we leave the rest of that rock out here.\" There was another buzz of conversation; a few heads nodded in affirmation.\n\"I must agree with Stephan,\" Joanna spoke up, glancing at me and then looking back at Salazar. \"I've looked that asteroid over very carefully. It's full of ores and deposits of metal that are badly needed. That thing is worth a fortune! More than that it's...\"\nSalazar cut her off with a wave of his hand. \"It does not matter, the mass of the entire asteroid is too great for our boosters. We do not have sufficient power.\"\n\"Where the hell did you get that idea?\" I said, his obvious runaround was making me even madder. \"There's a five percent fuel margin, if we get them attached and operating within the thirty day window.\"\nTrying to reason with him was like arguing with Geographos itself. He wasn't even looking at me.\n\"I can't believe you'd make this kind of change without some discussion,\" I said, my anger beginning to get out of hand. \"We must go with the original plan! Do you have any idea how much work we've put in on calculations alone?\"\n\"It has already been decided...\" he began.\n\"This is bullshit, Salazar!\" I interrupted. The room was suddenly silent. \"You can't run this project like it's a god-damned banana plantation!\"\nMaybe that was a mistake.\n\"Enough, Senor Perkins,\" he said, his eyes smoldering. \"We make preparations to blast the asteroid tomorrow.\"\n\"We'll see about that!\" I said as I stormed out of the chamber. I was so angry that I might have done him harm if I hadn't left. The way things turned out, maybe I should have stayed a little longer.\nI put a call through to the committee; they were in agreement with Salazar. I ranted at them for a short while about the opportunities they were missing before they cut me off. Finally, I went back to my quarters where I floated and silently fumed for most of the evening. The following day I plodded through my duties without much enthusiasm. I knew I was in trouble when I found myself staring at the same equation for most of the morning trying to get it to make sense. I couldn't. My mind would keep wandering back to the altercation in the briefing room. I'd shake my head to clear it and plunge back into my work. All in vain. After two days of this, I came to a decision. I was going to resign, there was no way I could work with that man as my superior till the project was completed. Who knows what other surprises he had in store for us? I wrote a letter outlining my intentions, made the announcement and prepared to leave on the next shuttle, which was mercifully due in less than a week.\nJoanna joined me on the shuttle when the time came to leave. I didn't even notice her until she spoke. I was strapped into an acceleration couch lost in a final bittersweet look at Geographos out of the side viewport.\n\"Mind if I join you?\" she said.\n\"Huh? Oh, Joanna,\" I said. My surprise was genuine. \"No of course not. I was daydreaming.\" I helped her strap into the adjacent couch. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\"I'm done,\" she said. \"They have my report, they don't need a geologist anymore. You know what a stickler Salazar is for efficiency. Besides that, if you remember, I questioned his judgment at a recent staff meeting.\"\n\"Yeah, I know. So did I!\" I said with a tentative smile, surprised that I could actually joke about it.\n\"Is that what you call it?\" she replied, grinning. \"I'd say what you did was more like an insult to his mother!\" We both laughed.\nThe conversation went on from there. She was easy to talk to and had a great sense of humor, which was really a good thing because we had a couple of months worth of space flight ahead of us with little to do. I found out that she had just recently come from a post-doc in geology at Colorado State and was looking for a job, hopefully an assistant professor's position or something. It was more than chance that had brought her the short stint on our Geographos survey. In addition to having a Ph.D in geology, she was an experienced rock climber. I guess that explains why she had so little trouble getting around while we were surveying the asteroid. She was surprised to find out that she really liked working in space. That was just one of the things we had in common. We got through all of this before the noise and discomfort of the shuttle's departure interrupted the conversation.\nWhat else do I tell you about Joanna. She wasn't a woman with the kind of looks that were distracting; at least, I didn't think so at first. She was more pretty than beautiful, with a clear and honest face. She fought a constant battle with a few extra kilos of body weight, a battle that she could never quite win. But, she was just the tonic I needed. After we had spent a week or so together on the shuttle, I found that my attitude towards her had changed. In fact, I was beginning to think she was rather attractive. It didn't hurt that she was in complete agreement with my actions on the belt ship.\n\"You were absolutely right, Stephan,\" she said, at one point. \"They're wasting a great opportunity. Not only would it be valuable for its ore content, we could have had a captive asteroid to study. Losing that disappointed me more than the sheer monetary value of the thing. As it stands right now, you have to go clear out to the belt to get a good look at an asteroid. I'd call it an 'astronomical' shame.\"\nThat got a groan from me, too.\nBy the time we got to earth, we found that our feelings for each other had gone beyond friendship. Way beyond. Perhaps it was because we had been together nearly every hour for the better part of two months. Or, maybe it was the fact that both of us were unattached and lonely because, up to that point in our lives, we had both been obsessively dedicated to our work. Whatever the reasons, we had fallen deeply in love. There was no question that we would be spending a lot more time together. My previous employments had left me modestly wealthy and I wasn't in any rush to find another job. Together, we organized some rallies and demonstrations to try and halt the Columbia Canal Project. That turned out to be an educational experience.\nFor starters, we needed some dirt to throw. To get the dirt, we had to be willing to do a little digging. Fortunately, I still had some important friends who were willing to give me a hand with the shovelling. The pile of dirt concerning Diego Salazar quickly grew to almost mountainous proportions. The picture of him that gradually emerged was frightening, much more alarming then I could have possibly imagined. There have been few men who were as ambitious, as ruthless, or as crooked as he was. He controlled vast wealth, much of it hidden in a labyrinthine series of farms, businesses, foundations, trusts, and other fronts. Out of this mess, I was able to piece together just why he was on the mission and why he had made those critical changes to the project, changes that had ended up with me resigning my position.\nHe had come along on the mission because he thought that he would be safe there. You don't get to the point in life that Salazar was at without making some friends--and some enemies. They had managed to keep it quiet, but there had been a nearly successful attempt on his life. While he was safe in space, his enforcers would find and eliminate the threat.\nHe had changed the project for financial reasons. Among his many holdings, Salazar owned controlling interest in the company that had leased the belt ship and boosters. He had found a way to save some badly needed capital and his reputation at the same time. The savings would come because the extra work involved in moving the tail section was to have required another utility ship and several months of expensive labor. Salazar's empire was huge and sprawling, but not all of it was solvent and they didn't have all that much in liquid assets. They had borrowed some money from the canal project to keep several of the other concerns afloat. As a result, they didn't have enough ready cash to pay for the extra belt ship. As you know, the belt government never has much cash either; business with them is strictly cash-in-advance. The solution was simple: just make up some plausible excuse and cancel that part of the project. There would likely be a court battle afterwards but the people who had invested in the venture knew it was a high risk operation at the outset. They had signed contracts to that effect. Chances were very good that they would have to absorb the loss.\nBut there was even more to it than just the financial end of things. The tail section of the asteroid was to have been signed over to interests that were owned by wealthy citizens of the USA. Among his other charming attributes, Salazar had no love for North Americans. The set-up was perfect; he could preserve his empire and he could screw some rich Americans at the same time. Apparently, he just couldn't resist it.\nIt was Carlos who brought the whole protest episode to a close. We'd had two marches in the first six months and had gotten a little publicity, not nearly enough, but it was a start. To my great surprise, he came in person to visit us. Joanna and I were getting ready to kick off another rally in the next couple of weeks. We heard a knock on our door. Joanna answered it.\n\"Carlos!\" she cried, embracing him. \"What a surprise! Please come in.\" She held the door for him. I got up and extended my hand.\n\"It's been a long time, my friend.\" I said. \"How are you?\"\nHe shook my hand with his usual firm grip and released it.\n\"Tired.\" he said, matter-of-factly. We motioned to him to sit down. \"I am running the engineering end of the project nearly by myself since you left.\"\n\"That's not entirely my fault,\" I returned, as I sat also. \"I had to make a very difficult decision.\" He nodded.\n\"What brings you here, Carlos?\" asked Joanna, from across the room.\n\"I have come to plead with you to stop your involvement with the protest marches,\" he began.\n\"Come on, Carlos,\" I interrupted. \"Diego Salazar is pure poison, nothing more than a common criminal. He ought to be locked up!\"\n\"We have inside information, Carlos. He deals in arms and drugs and prostitution and who knows what else,\" added Joanna.\n\"I harbor no illusions about his character, Joanna,\" he replied, with his soft voice. \"But I speak to you both on behalf of my country, and my people. In fact this canal will benefit the entire South American continent. Believe me, I would throw Salazar to the dogs today if it were in my power. For the moment, you must forget about him. We are now near some of the most critical aspects of the entire project. My friendship with you has made Salazar very antagonistic to me, and the distraction that this causes makes it very difficult for me to do my work. He will have others who are not as competent or as careful as I redo the calculations. I need not tell you how serious that could be.\"\n\"What about the tail section fiasco?\" I asked. \"You can't tell me that wasn't a tremendous waste.\"\n\"I fully agree, Stephan,\" he replied. \"That was a great pity, but it is also too late to correct. We must now deal with the present and the future. I tell you that your involvement in these protests may actually compromise the safety of the project!\"\nIt was as I thought, Carlos had stayed on the project because he sincerely felt that the benefits to his country and his people far outweighed any personal differences between him and Salazar. That was exactly what I would have expected from him; he was that sort of man. It was this sincere plea from him, our trusted and esteemed friend, that made us decide to stop. That and the realization that they would complete the project in spite of us and that our protests might actually jeopardize its success.\n\"As you wish, my friend,\" I sighed.\n\"I ask one more favor, Stephan,\" he said, gravely. \"Believe me, I do not ask this lightly.\"\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\"Will you check my final calculations, please? Just look them over and tell me if you see anything radically wrong.\"\nI thought about it for a while. It might have been a moment of weakness, but he had made a great deal of sense and I am a reasonable man. I agreed to do it.\nThus ended the protest phase, but my being in those demonstrations had a profound effect on later events. Meanwhile, the Project continued, under Salazar's able leadership.\nJoanna got a teaching job at a small California school a short while later. I went with her, and managed to keep as busy as I wanted to be with some consulting work and pecking away at a book about the L-5 project. Both of us were very pleased with this arrangement; I, for one, had never been happier. We took some time off and headed south for the show, when the time came for the first skip of the rock through the atmosphere. It was the kind of thing you talked about for years afterwards. I'll never forget the Herculean, coruscating arc of light that flashed across the sky as it lanced spectacularly through the stratosphere. Joanna and I held hands as we watched. It was awesome, beautiful! I almost wished that I were still involved in the project at that moment. Which, in a small way, I still was.\nCarlos had remained in touch with us, as he had promised, without Salazar's knowledge. He had sent me the final figures and calculations; as I had promised, I checked them. It made sense to me, if they were determined to go through with the project I wanted them to get it right. Remember, they were going to drop a small mountain out of space. It was best if they didn't screw it up! It pleased me that our original calculations had been very close. During the final stages of the project, we consulted whenever Carlos thought it was necessary.\nThe earlier show was nothing compared to the one that we saw on the day of impact. They had managed to scrub off enough speed and were satisfied that the shape of the projectile was within tolerances. The time had come to bring it down. They promised us the greatest spectacle ever witnessed by modern man. Perhaps they were right. An entire world watched and waited anxiously for the impact, not knowing what to expect. Finally, they gave the rock a gentle, precisely calculated shove to start its fall. We held our breath as the fiery mace of God descended out of the heavens to wreak devastation on the hapless, unsuspecting land bridge. The earth rang like a bell from the impact of the titanic blow as the shock wave reverberated violently through it. There was damage to windows and dwellings as far away as Mexico City, but people from all over the world claimed to have felt some kind of movement. Joanna and I were in Bogota. I was literally knocked off my feet! There was even a video of the impact area that had been obtained by some reckless and intrepid reporter. They ran it over and over for days afterwards on the newscasts. I never tired of watching it. To this day, I still remember the sight of the oceans rushing headlong into the enormous new crater from both directions and a huge cloud of pulverized asteroid, earth and steam billowing upward as the waters made contact with the still molten core of what had once been a piece of the sky.\nIt ended up as a huge, angry mushroom cloud that slowly dissipated over a few hours. And there were after-effects. All of the dust and debris that were put into the atmosphere meant that, among other things, we were treated to the most incredible sunsets for several months after the impact.\nThe project was an unqualified success. After about six months of cleanup work and a little testing, the Columbia Canal was opened to the ships of the world. The canal needed no locks and even the largest ships ever built had no trouble passing through its generous ways.\nCarlos was made wealthy by his involvement with the project. Most of the notoriety went to project leader Diego Salazar. He became even more powerful, there was even talk of a presidency. After a short court battle, several North American investment firms went quietly into receivership. I got an offer from the colonial government of the asteroid belt to oversee some new construction projects. I asked them if they could use a good geologist. In no time, Joanna and I were off to the belt, happy to be back in space. No place was too far away from Diego Salazar as far as I was concerned. Carlos got involved with some huge project on Luna. Women still swooned over him wherever he went. He didn't seem to mind.\nAll this happened quite a few years ago. I wish I could say that the story ended there, but I can't. It seems that it isn't nice to fool around with the forces of the universe. Remember what I said about parking the tail section of Geographos at the L-4 point of the earth-luna system? Well, at least we could have kept an eye on it. Like clockwork, the remainder of the asteroid came around on its appointed path twenty-five years later. Only this time someone had reset the clock! I remember I was having breakfast at the station on Ceres when I got a call from Carlos. We had tried to keep in touch but I hadn't heard from him for two or three years.\n\"Stephan?\" he said. \"You must help me again with some calculations.\" I could hear the strain in his voice, even over the noise of the transmission. A call to the belt was one-sided since the communication lag made two-way conversation impractical. He continued. \"It's Geographos, or what's left of it. It will probably hit the earth in about two months.\" I choked on my coffee. \"I've been over the calculations at least a hundred times. I don't know, maybe it was the explosives, or the change in mass. Its orbit has changed just enough. We were right the first time my friend. We should have taken the tail section to the L-4 point. If it doesn't hit it will come awfully close.\" He paused, sighed and added. \"But I think it's going to hit.\"\nHe gave me the figures before he solemnly signed off. I called him a few hours later, he had made no mistake, it was gonna hit. Someplace... It seemed we were helpless to stop the impact. Blowing it up was out of the question; it would take a nuke to do the job and the nuclear disarmament movements of the 1990's had been successful beyond hope. No warheads remained to obliterate the remaining piece of Geographos. That left us with the prospect of deflecting its course. But remember that it had taken years of careful calculations and subtle adjustments to guide the original piece in. Besides, the huge motors had been purposely built for that one project. We had some that were big enough there in the belt maybe but they were too far away, and there was too little time.\nOr so it seemed.\nI think it was that last thought about the big boosters that gave me the inspiration. We had two boosters right there at the Ceres Station that were soon to be transported out to the deep belt. They had just been overhauled and were ready to be put back to work moving mineral-rich asteroids to the orbiting solar smelting factories. Using the boosters as a starting point, I began to put together the elements of a bold and daring rescue plan. I did a few quick calculations, rechecked them, and called the governor of the belt colony. When I told him the situation, he cancelled his remaining engagements and told me he could meet me in about an hour. I used the time to further refine my calculations and, if I do say so myself, I was able to give him a fairly convincing argument after he arrived.\nThose mining boosters were huge, massive and ungainly but they were extremely powerful. Normally they were shuffled around in the belt by the all-purpose utility ships. They could be moved easily by this means, anywhere you wanted, provided you weren't in any hurry. We needed all the speed we could get and more. My brainstorm was to use the boosters to boost themselves. They developed more than enough thrust, especially if the payload was small. With a little luck, it looked like we might get both of them to the errant chunk of rock with about a week to spare. All we needed to do then was hook them up and refuel them.\nTwo days later, Joanna and I and a hastily assembled team of specialists made preparations to leave. Our spaceship had been put together just as quickly. You could tell that by looking at it. It consisted of the two huge asteroid boosters that had been strapped to a standard belt utility ship which, in turn, had a large spherical fuel storage tank attached to its belly. The whole structure was tied together with uneven lengths of pipe, I-beam, cables and other assorted leftovers. It was a very strange looking craft; certainly not the type of thing that was destined for greatness. There hadn't been time to make it pretty, but we were reasonably sure it would hold together.\nI called Carlos to tell him what we were doing and where the best point for us to rendezvous was. Then we settled into our couches and prepared for the onset of some brutal acceleration. We weren't disappointed. We blasted away with little fanfare, our teeth gritted and our faces grim. Our mission: to save earth. Just before I blacked out, I remember thinking that I was getting a little old for this kind of activity.\nCarlos and another quickly assembled batch of experts met us a day away from the speeding fragment. We got together to compare notes and to decide on the best plan to avert the coming disaster. My crew from the belt did an incredible job of matching velocities with the tail section of the asteroid and then outdid themselves in how quickly they got the boosters attached. Funny how adversity can bring out the best in people. All that remained was to top off the fuel tanks on the boosters and we could start to alter the course of the hurtling rock. Not a moment too soon either. By the time we had finished our preparations, the earth loomed as a large blue and white sphere; a sphere that was alarmingly near by!\nOur calculations were going to have to be good enough because time had run out. It was to be a very near thing. In fact, we found out early on that we couldn't get the rock to miss the earth. The best we could hope for was to steer it to impact in an uninhabited and desolate place. After a blazing, lump-in-the-throat, fingers-crossed descent we were successful. Along with us, the entire world breathed a sigh of relief. Oh, there were some fairly severe earthquakes in a few key places, like Greece, for instance, but that area has always been seismically unstable. Again, the people of earth were treated to some spectacular sunsets.\nThe man ultimately responsible for all of this, Diego Salazar, was caught trying to make off with a sizeable quantity of gold from the Columbian treasury just before our successful rescue. That might have been enough, but he had other problems. There was an international board of inquiry assembled to investigate possible wrongdoing on the part of those who had been heavily involved in the canal project. People like Salazar, Carlos and myself. Remember those silly demonstrations? They had nothing on me, I had gone on record as opposing the project the way it was then being run. I was just popular enough after our daring rescue to persuade them that Carlos was also free of guilt. Too bad Salazar had tried to disappear. After that he didn't have a chance. The board labeled him an international criminal, guilty of crimes against humanity. He was to be jailed for a very long time. I still smile every time I think of it.\nAs for the impact zone, it is now a very sought after piece of real estate. The alterations in topography that were wrought by the runaway asteroid have dramatically changed the entire region. It is now a tropical paradise, with lush vegetation, a thriving tourist trade and booming agriculture. We didn't plan it that way, our only goal had been finding some way to avoid a complete disaster. But, in actuality, things couldn't have turned out any better. They are no longer calling it the Sahara desert, the name doesn't fit anymore. The huge new inland sea that we created in the middle of it has changed all that.\nPhil Nolte has been writing Science-Fiction for about three years, although he's been reading and enjoying it for most of his life. He says that, for him, writing started out as \"a lark\" just to see if he could actually do it. Later, he found himself getting more and more serious about it. He still writes at home in his spare time, often when others are totally wasting their time watching dreadful TV sitcoms, etc... His obsession is a better use of time. In addition to fiction, he's also written several science history articles for a local (Red River Valley) trade journal. Two of his other stories have been published in Athene.\nNU020061@VM1.NoDak.EDU","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

They satiated this hunger by spending their hard-earned credits. They spent them on all sorts of junk: clothing and games, trinkets and baubles and who knows what else! If it said \"marathon\" on it they bought it, avidly. There were also those who took the obsession to more bizarre lengths. Like Morris Quimby, for instance. For part of each day, Quimby was one of several hundred accountants employed by the huge Federated Metals consortium. At home, after work, deep in the overpopulated rabbit warren that had been carved out of the interior of Ceres, he was a Marathon fanatic. For a few hours, each day he could forget about his mundane job and his shrewish wife and his four squalling children. For a few hours he was master of his own universe as he gloried in the power of his statistical games. He would compile detailed and arcane statistics about past and present marathons. Statistics that had meaning only to him. It was a harmless enough occupation, especially since it had probably kept him from going mad. For the time being, it kept him happy. How could he have known what incredible fame and fortune his oddball hobby would bring him?\nIn a Galaxy teeming with humans who were ruled by a government that was powerful, corrupt and immovable, the great race was a welcome diversion. The Marathon was held every four years against the backdrop of the asteroid belt in the Sol system, the birthplace of Man before he spread out to populate the galaxy. The sprawling, rocky disc of the belt contains an uncounted number of asteroids ranging from sizeable planetoids, like Ceres, down to specks no bigger than grains of sand and dust motes. In spite of this, the belt is mostly empty space. But there are areas where matter is fairly concentrated, where huge clusters of variously sized lumps of rock are locked on a perpetual cosmic carousel by their mutual gravitational attractions. A tortuous route was mapped out over a 10,000 kilometer course that made the tiny spaceships of the racers wind their way over, under and around the countless planetoids and boulders that made up one of the larger concentrations of matter in the belt. The race was not, as some thought, from Ceres to Pallas. Instead, the name referred to the dual sponsorship of the event by the businesses of the two asteroids.\nImagine an equilateral triangle whose half-kilometer sides are made up of bright bars of neon-green light. Each of the thousands of gates that marked out the course was just such a triangle. Successful negotiation of a gate meant that the contestant's ship passed through somewhere within the triangle. Missing a gate meant disqualification. Between gates the contestants could take any path that they wished. Time could be gained by skimming as closely as possible to the asteroid obstacles in search of the line that placed the spacecraft in the best position for the next maneuver. It was here that the skill and daring of the top racers set them apart from the rest. Invariably several racers were killed and others seriously injured when they tried to gain those precious extra tenths of a second and found that they had used up their narrow margin of safety. The line between superior speed and instant disaster was a razor's edge, ever waiting to nick the unwary.\nThe Asteroid Marathon, as it was sometimes called, was contested in special one-man space vehicles. Main thrust was provided by a conventional, ultra-high efficiency, electric ion-grid drive. What made them special was that the source of electricity was a man-powered generator.\nEssentially, they were pedal-powered spacecraft.\nThe next running of the great event was only a week away and the handicappers agreed that the contest was down to about twenty-five people out of some two-thousand qualifiers who had a shot at upsetting the champion. The champion was good---the odds were still heavily in his favor.\n\"What'cha thinking, Yuri?\"\nYuri Ramosian, the reigning Marathon champion, shook his head as he looked around the prep room at the other contestants, appraising the competition.\n\"I don't know, A.J....\" said Yuri, \"some of these guys look pretty tough!\"\n\"Tough\" might have been an understatement. Most of the others were young men, in their physical prime, lean to the point of gauntness, their bodies ropily muscular. Scattered through the group also was a handful of young women. Yuri's gaze came to rest on one in particular.\n\"That's Chen-Lee, right A.J.? The one we were briefed about?\"\nThe young lady in question was, like the rest of the competition, in top physical condition. Her small bosom was mashed almost flat by the skin-tight fabric of her gaily-colored racing suit and she had the narrow, boyish hips characteristic of top female athletes. Below, the large, powerful, almost grotesque muscles of her marathoner's legs stood out in sharp relief. Unlike the others, she was also strikingly attractive with jet black hair, an oval face and exotic almond-shaped eyes.\n\"Yeah,\" replied Thorpe, \"She won a couple minor races out in the Kepler Quadrant last year. Big deal.\"\n\"I heard that she won them pretty handily, A.J....\"\n\"Sure, Yuri, that's how she got here. Relax, Champ, the handicappers got her tagged a hundred-to-one! She's in the first wave because she's good press---a dark horse from some godforsaken outposter colony.\" He nodded in the young girl's direction. \"Though you got to admit she won't look bad on the newsvids either!\"\n\"Right, A.J.,\" said Yuri, reassured, as usual, by his teamate's shrewd assessment of the situation. But he had to be honest with himself, the young woman's chances were as good as anyone's.\nTheir discussion was ended by a call from the crew captain to get ready. The two men strapped on their helmets and slapped hands in a classic high five before squeezing into the cockpits of their racing crafts.\nThe day's practice session was about to begin. For a few hours each day in the week before the race, the contestants were allowed on a small practice course near Ceres for training and for testing and adjusting the tiny racing vessels.\nOn the other side of the prep room, Cassandra Chen-Lee also strapped on her lightweight meta-kevlar racing helmet prior to entering her ship for the mid-afternoon workout. She signaled the support crew to push her into the airlock and then ran down a mental checklist while the lock cycled. With the outer door fully open, she began pedaling slowly and used the joystick to divert a small amount of power to the maneuvering thrusters. The tiny ship came gently about and she began pedaling a bit harder to put some space between her and the dock. Cassandra felt the usual tightness in her chest, the lump in her throat that always came unbidden whenever she took the ship out intending to go really fast. As soon as she got out on the course and up to speed, she knew from experience that the feeling would pass.\nPumping the pedals rhythmically, she banked the needle-nosed craft out towards the practice course. After a signal from the gate official that it was safe to enter, she passed through the bright green triangle of the first gate.\nCassandra fell in with a flight of five racers who were warming up and testing the control systems on their racing ships, making sure that things were properly adjusted. Like a multi-colored flock of swift, plastic birds, they soared through several of the gates in a graceful and ever-changing cluster. Within minutes, she knew there were no top competitors like herself in the group and she found herself growing impatient. Their lines were sloppy and none of them had the same intense drive out of the gates as she did. Not that it really mattered. Cassandra had been waiting for two ships in particular, both of which had just caught and passed her group. She increased her speed to join the new pair.\nFree of the slow pack, with the other racers in her sights, she felt her spirit soar. As one, the three executed a series of intricate, difficult maneuvers flawlessly. Her powerful legs pumped the pedals smoothly, instinctively, without conscious thought as her breathing and pulse rate quickened. Cassandra became an intense ball of concentration, her attention focused completely on piloting her racing craft. For the first time in months, she felt wholly, vibrantly alive! To the trained marathoner this was heady, joyous fun! For nearly two complete circuits she barnstormed the practice course with the other two craft, learning the lines the other pilots used, sizing them up. Finally she made a move on them at the second-to-last gate. The other racers hadn't expected the maneuver and both had to change their line slightly to let her execute the pass by going between them.\nThere had nearly been contact between the ships---a mere ten centimeters was all that separated them, but the skills of all three racers were such that none of them had been in any real danger---top level racers handled such maneuvers routinely. Under race conditions, it was not at all uncommon for ships to brush one another or for more serious contacts to occur.\nThe practice session over, the racers waited for their support crews aboard their chase ships to come and pick them up. Even at the end of a practice session, the speeds achieved were astounding. Without a chase ship, the racer would have been required to expend an equal amount of energy on deceleration. Clearly a waste of time! Better to let a nuclear powered craft do the job for you. As the chase ship began to reel Cassandra in, she signaled to them with a circle made with thumb and forefinger---the universal sign: everything OK.\nAs soon as she got back to the race facility, Cassandra sought out the two pilots that she had been sparring with for a little post-practice banter. She had no trouble finding the gaily colored ships. As she came up to them, the pilots were standing with their backs to her. One was demonstrating a racing maneuver with his hands and the other was nodding in agreement.\n\"That was a good session!\" she said. \"Sorry about that last gate.\" She did a double-take as they turned to look at her. \"Omigod!\" she blurted. \"You're Yuri Ramosian!\" She looked at the other racer. \"And you must be A.J. Thorpe?\"\nThe teammates smiled at Cassandra's obvious discomfort.\n\"That was you in the yellow and blue ship?\" asked Thorpe. The young girl nodded sheepishly. Thorpe's reply surprised her. \"Good move! We were a tad too relaxed. Serves us right. Right, Yuri?\"\n\"Right, A.J. It's Cassandra, isn't it? Cassandra Chen-Lee?\" asked Yuri. The young girl nodded, still a little wide-eyed.\nYuri continued. \"I agree, it was a hell of a good session! And don't worry, that was a good move you made at gate seventeen. I came in a little slow and a little wide.\" He shrugged, \"You did the same thing I would have done!\"\nCassandra was a surprised to find that Ramosian stood at least a full head shorter than she did. Like many people who finally meet a legend, she discovered that her mental image of the champ was larger than life. He was also beginning to show his age a little. No youth drugs for marathoners! At this level of competition nearly all drugs were illegal and they were rigidly tested for. As a result, he was showing a little grey at the temples and some salt and pepper in the rest of his hair. But, outside of the little touches of grey and the laugh-wrinkles around his brown eyes, the rest of him was all-business, alloy hard, compact and muscular, ready for anything. His companion, Thorpe, was almost a perfect contrast. Descended from old-earth Kenyan stock, Thorpe was black-skinned and had the characteristic distance runner's physique---long-limbed, gaunt and wiry, without a trace of body fat.\nWith the introductions over, a short awkward silence ensued. Cassandra self-consciously ran a hand through her dark, damp hair and tried to think of something intelligent to say. Thorpe spoke first.\n\"I don't know 'bout you guys, but I'm for a hot shower and a cold drink. Cassandra, why don't you meet us at Killian's after we all clean up some?\" he asked.\n\"Good idea, A.J.,\" said Yuri.\n\"Killian's?\" she asked.\n\"It's a little bar just down the corridor,\" said Yuri. \"Kind of a racers hangout. You'll like it. It's a good place to unwind after practice.\"\nCassandra seemed lost in some internal battle for a few moments before she made up her mind. \"Okay,\" she said, nodding. \"Killian's it is. Forty-five minutes?\"\nAn hour later she pushed cautiously through an old-fashioned, ornate door into the dimly lit interior of Killian's Olde Irish Pub. She looked around a bit while waiting for her eyes to adjust. An interesting place. The management had tried to capture the spirit of an old-earth English pub, say about mid-nineteenth century. They had done an admirable job, and even though there was no way that the dark paneling could be real wood or that the lamps could be burning natural gas, the place looked downright old. There was little doubt that the bar was a hangout for earth natives and marathon racers---the full-earth gravity guaranteed that. Cassandra didn't know for sure what an old pub was supposed to look like, but she decided immediately that she liked the place.\nYuri signaled to her from a booth in the back corner. Thorpe sat across from him, his long, bony frame somehow jack-knifed into the confines of the smallish booth. Cassandra headed towards them across the crowded bar.\nA change into civilian clothing had wrought a transformation in the young girl. A blue outfit accentuated her less-than-generous bosom and disguised the heavily muscled legs. Her glossy black hair made for a flattering contrast against the soft, pale fabric and her smooth, golden skin as it fell in a braid beside her long graceful neck and over her bare shoulder. The hard, purposeful athlete had become tantalizingly feminine. What's more, the exotic almond-shaped eyes were a startling and very beautiful shade of blue! Both men watched in fascination as she slid into the empty space next to Yuri.\nYuri and Thorpe were having the house specialty, an English style pale ale. Their glasses were about half-full. Cassandra thought for a moment before ordering from the human waiter.\n\"Bring me something wet, and non-alcoholic,\" she said.\n\"Did you see the Marathon coverage on the newsvids this morning?\" asked Yuri. \"It seems like everywhere you look you get this awful pre-race hype! I know it's part of the package, but sometimes I wish they'd just leave us alone and let us race!\" He shook his head in disgust.\n\"Not to worry, Cassandra,\" said Thorpe, winking. \"He always gets this way before a big race.\" The Champ took a pull on his mug of ale and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\"You're right, A.J. Enough of that,\" said Yuri. \"How about we change the subject. Let's talk about Cassandra instead.\"\nCassandra took a sip of her drink and swallowed. \"Fine,\" she said, bravely. \"What would you like to know?\"\nThorpe shrugged. \"Where you from?\"\n\"The New Ceylon colony.\" Their blank expressions were expected. She continued, \"It's in the Naccobus star system, way out on the very edge of explored space. But it's nice. You'd like it. It's clean and underpopulated and they grow the best coffee in the galaxy.\"\n\"Mining?\" asked Yuri.\n\"Lots,\" said Cassandra. \"In fact, it's our main industry.\"\nYuri nodded his head and took another drink of the ale, swallowed and softly smacked his lips in appreciation. \"Truly a fine ale! Problem is, I only get to have one. Training rules.\"\n\"Training rules, Hah! Admit it, Champ, you jus' ain't as young as you used to be!\" prodded the much-younger Thorpe, winking at Cassandra. Adding insult to injury, Thorpe ordered himself another drink.\n\"We'll see about that next Sunday,\" said the Champ, the laugh-wrinkles around his eyes intensifying slightly. \"If you can manage to squeeze that bony carcass of yours into that little tiny ship!\" Cassandra smiled at the good-natured banter between the two teammates. She decided that Yuri had been right, Killian's was a good place to unwind.\nThe pub was crowded and noisy. Cassandra looked around the room at the various knots of race personnel, easily picking out the pilots. Some she recognized, others were still wearing their racing suits, no doubt in an effort to improve their chances of scoring with one or another of the bar's many female patrons. Over on the other side of the bar there was a good-sized group that was engrossed in some kind of hilarious game. Every now and then a shout would erupt, followed by a chorus of laughter from the rest of the group. One of the men in the small group caught her eye and waved. She waved back shyly.\n\"What's going on over there?\" she asked.\n\"That's Michaels and Sharp and the gang,\" said Thorpe. \"They could be up to mos' anythin'---you can't never tell with that bunch. Oh yeah, the wimpy guy on the left is somethin' different though. He's an accountant. Name's Morris Quimby. Been hanging around the bar for a couple days now. The guy's amazin', he can tell you anythin' you want to know 'bout mos' any Marathon, past or present. Hell, he can probably tell you what your split times were from this mornin's session...and mine and Yuri's and all the other top contenders.\" He took a pull on his ale. \"They're good guys. You wanna meet 'em?\"\n\"I'd like that,\" she replied. \"But later, let's finish our drinks first.\"\nThe shared experiences of the racers meant that they had much in common, and conversation was easy as Cassandra got over the initial rush of actually meeting and being with the two celebrities and began to relax a little. After a few more minutes of getting acquainted, Cassandra turned the conversation in a more serious direction.\n\"Do you think you can win the championship again?\" she asked, surprised at her own boldness. \"The competition looks really good this year.\"\nThe Champ's reply was unexpected, \"I don't know,\" he shrugged. \"What's more, I don't really care all that much. Remember, I've won this damned extravaganza twice. If I go out next week and ride my best but am defeated by you or one of these other handsome young racers...\" He motioned towards the group at the other side of the room. \"...that won't matter. I'm the most alive when I'm racing!\"\n\"I understand, Mr. Ram...er Yuri,\" she said, sensing the kinship that they shared. \"The ship is like it's part of your body. You drive it with your own vitality and you feel it respond to the slightest move of your hand. Racing takes total concentration; while you're doing it, you forget about everything else. That's an incredible feeling. But, I'll be honest, I like it best when I win!\"\n\"I'd say you got as good a chance as anybody,\" said Thorpe. Yuri nodded in agreement.\n\"Thanks,\" she sighed. \"You don't know how good it feels to hear you say that. I had a bad crash during the Heard's World Rally last year, and it's only been the last couple of months that I felt like I was back up to form.\"\n\"I know what you mean,\" said Yuri. \"I crashed in my first Asteroid Marathon twelve years ago. I got rear-ended during a chain-reaction incident at gate thirty-five. Wound up with a couple broken bones. I was worthless for weeks and I wasn't competitive for six months. Frustrating!\"\nCassandra nodded her head. \"I've really made progress since my trainer put me on a holistic program of diet, physical conditioning and mental exercises. It's safe to say that I wouldn't be here without him.\"\n\"Tell him he's done a good job,\" said Yuri. He looked around the room and sighed, \"I have to go pretty soon. But, I'm free later on. Are you doing anything?\"\nCassandra was flattered by the unexpected pass but knew she couldn't possibly take the Champ up on it. She quickly thought up a little lie to let him down easy. \"Thank you, no,\" she replied graciously. \"I have a boyfriend waiting for me.\" Yuri shrugged, and smiled.\n\"I was afraid of that! Can't blame me for trying! Seriously, I really enjoyed talking to you. Good luck in the race.\" He finished his ale and after taking---and kissing---her hand, left the bar with a wave to the raucous group across the room.\n\"Come on,\" said Thorpe. \"I'll introduce you to these animals.\" Cassandra picked up her drink and followed her lanky new friend across the room.\nThe group was young, eager and ready to party. This close to a major race, the pilots generally backed off on the alcohol but several of the crew members were getting pretty drunk.\nLooking the group over, Cassandra was reminded once again that the combination of mental and physical attributes that make for a successful racer can come in the strangest packages. Some are cerebral about their approach, like Yuri Ramosian, for instance. Ramosian held an advanced degree in electro-physical engineering and had all sorts of reasons why he raced. He could spend hours talking about it. Thorpe had only a minimum of formal education and, unless you pinned him down, would rather talk about anything else. Both were Marathoners but, aside from that, Ramosian and Thorpe were pretty normal---just regular guys.\nAnd then there was Sharp, the ringleader of the party group. Sharp was certifiably nuts. He was still in his sweaty practice suit and he had opened the collar and rolled up the sleeves in the warm and crowded bar. Above his round face, the thinning hair on his bare head was still plastered to his forehead from sweating inside his helmet during practice. Cassandra sensed that even in normal clothing Sharp would have had an unkempt look about him. Wild, unpredictable, and loud, they called him \"Torpedo\" Sharp because of his actions both on and off the race course. It was difficult to fathom his motives. As reckless as he was, he probably raced out of some submerged death wish.\nThe game was `Catch the five credit note'. A simple game; perhaps a challenge only to those who have had a few too many drinks. The player would put his hand on the table with thumb and forefinger extended out over the edge and held about a centimeter apart. The object of the game was to catch a five credit note that was dropped between the thumb and forefinger. An obviously inebriated young racer was about to try his luck. The wobbly young man was the number two rider for the Lotus team. A practice crash during the day's session had left him without a ride. He was either celebrating being alive or drowning his sorrows because he wouldn't be in the race---take your pick, at this stage it was hard to tell.\nAt the other end of the table, the group made room for Cassandra and Thorpe to sit. As the game began again, Cassandra found herself sitting right next to the one who had been pointed out to her as `Quimby'.\nSharp held the five-credit note so that the oval picture of president Tsumaki's face in the middle of the bill was lined up with the contestant's thumb.\n\"He'll never catch it,\" said the little accountant, in a surprisingly deep baritone. \"He's had way too much to drink.\"\nSharp released the bill and sure enough, the young racer's fingers closed on empty air.\n\"How did you know that would happen?\" asked Cassandra, while Sharp retrieved the bill.\n\"It's quite simple, really,\" replied Quimby. \"This game is just a crude test of reaction time. The participant sees the note begin to fall, but the nerve impulse from brain to hand isn't quite quick enough for him to close his fingers before the bill has dropped past them. Placing the hand on the edge of the table means the bill can't be followed down either.\" Cassandra nodded in understanding.\n\"I don't suppose a few drinks help any, do they?\" she asked.\n\"No, they don't,\" replied Quimby. \"Even though a racer, like yourself, generally has a much faster reaction time than a normal person, a few drinks will quickly remove that advantage.\"\n\"Damn!\" said the frustrated young drunk, as he missed a second try.\n\"C'mon, Sharp, drop it again!\"\nSharp dropped the bill again, with the same result. The entire group laughed at the shout of outrage, Cassandra along with them. That, unfortunately, got the irate contestant's attention. \"It looks easy from down there, doesn't it?\" he challenged, looking straight at Cassandra. \"C'mon, sit over here! That is, if you think you can do any better!\"\nCassandra gulped and looked around the table. \"N..no! I don't. Really! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you.\"\nBut it was too late. Suddenly every one in the entire group thought it was an excellent idea.\n\"No excuses,\" said Sharp. \"C'mon, move over to the hot seat.\"\n\"Go ahead, my dear,\" said Quimby, chuckling. \"You certainly can't do any worse than anyone else.\"\nShe sat, reluctantly. \"Put your hand on the edge of table, like this,\" said Sharp, demonstrating. \"Hold your thumb and forefinger apart like this. Ready? Now!\"\nEven though she really wasn't ready, to everyone's surprise she caught the bill before it had moved a bare centimeter downward.\n\"Hey, no fair anticipatin'!\" said Sharp. \"Do it again.\"\nCassandra straighten her shoulders, took a deep breath and nodded her head. Again she caught the bill after only about a one centimeter drop.\n\"Three's the charm,\" said Sharp. \"One more time!\"\nShe missed it cleanly. And a fourth time. And a fifth. Finally she shook her head in exasperation. \"Enough!\" she said. \"I can't do it anymore. I must've just got lucky the first two times.\"\nThree failures in a row took the pressure off and someone else took the favored seat. The game continued. Quimby looked at her quizzically when she returned to her seat.\n\"Well done, Ms. Chen-Lee!\" said Quimby. \"Far and away the best performance of the evening!\" He made some notes in a little black book.\nCassandra finished a third drink and talked a bit longer with her new friends before excusing herself.\nA bony, nervous, elderly man was waiting in her suite when she finally got back.\n\"Where have you been?\" he asked, wringing his hands. \"You're two hours late! I wanted to examine you right after practice!\"\n\"Sorry, Richter. I had some business.\" The old man seemed to relax a little.\n\"Did you link up with Ramosian and Thorpe out on the course, Cass?\"\n\"Yeah, no problem.\"\n\"Did they suspect that you were waiting for them?\"\n\"No, I doubt it. I acted pretty surprised when I talked to them afterwards. Believe it or not, they invited me to have a drink with them! That's where I was. God, I hope they don't see us together!\" she added with a giggle. \"I told them you were my boyfriend!\"\nHe ignored the jibe, or didn't hear it. \"You talked to Ramosian?\" he asked, obviously impressed.\n\"Yes, I talked to Ramosian. In fact, we had a fairly long conversation. You know what? He said he doesn't care if he wins or loses, he just likes to race. Don't you find that strange?\"\n\"Strange?\" replied Richter. \"Not at all. Just don't you believe a word of it. He's been touting that line of solid waste so long that he may be beginning to believe it himself. Never fear, Cassandra, when the starting flag drops you'll be up against one the most competitive men who ever lived!\" Cassandra nodded in agreement.\n\"Don't worry, Richter, I wasn't fooled,\" she reassured him. \"Oh, by the way, your training system really works. I had the fastest reaction time in the bar!\"\nRichter looked suddenly worried. \"What did you do, Cass?\"\n\"Oh, nothing serious, I just caught a couple of five credit bills,\" she replied. \"And then I covered up by not catching three more of them.\" She ignored his puzzled look.\n\"You know what, Richter? It really felt super out there today. I'm beginning to have a very good feeling about this race!\" Cassandra hugged him and headed off towards her sleep chamber. She didn't see the satisfied smile on the old trainer's face as he dimmed the lights and turned towards his own room.\nThe Asteroid Marathon took place in the vacuum of space where there was no gravity or atmospheric friction to contend with. Under such conditions there were some important points to keep in mind. First, a racing craft that coasted without power did not slow down. Second, and more importantly, the craft's velocity was cumulative. Consider: spinning the pedals on a marathon craft transformed energy from the pilot's muscles into thrust. Thrust was used for changing velocity or for changing direction, both of which were necessary during the course of the race. Naturally, a racer tried to channel as much energy as possible into increasing his speed. The top competitors could reach truly amazing speeds by the end of 10,000 kilometers, a property that had a profound influence on the design of the Marathon race course. The course was designed with very tight and sharp maneuvers in the early going which gradually changed to more open and sweeping maneuvers at its end. In spite of this adjustment, because of the ever escalating velocities, negotiating the course became increasingly more difficult in the later stages.\nThere was a profound difference in safety between the beginning and end of the Marathon course also. A contestant that crashed near the beginning of the race when the velocities were down had a fair chance of survival. A similar incident at mid-course or later, at the frightening speeds achieved, was almost invariably fatal. The ships were constructed from state-of-the-art materials, but even their incredible strength could withstand only so much force, and the most fragile component---the pilot---was only flesh and blood.\nAt just over five meters in length, the racing ships were tiny. But they were breathtakingly beautiful. Aerodynamic styling was employed, not because it was required in the airlessness of space, but because the ships looked better that way. The Marathon was, first and foremost, a spectator sport. The ship's nose was long and pointed and the body swelled gracefully back to the widest part, the cockpit, where it was just over a meter wide. The body then tapered back to the chopped-off tail which housed the grid of the main thruster. The sleek outer shell of the ship was molded in any color or combination of colors that the owner\/sponsor wished. It was also common practice for each of the ships to be splashed with a colorful assortment of sponsor logos as well.\nInside the cockpit, the appointments were starkly utilitarian. There was a joystick that controled the maneuvers of the tiny ship and, of course, the pedals that drove it. A clear canopy covered the pressurized cockpit and vision \"below\" was provided by a small oval window in the floor---a threat to pass could come from anywhere. The instrumentation was likewise very simple: an accelerometer to gauge the amount of thrust, a speedometer, and a cluster of attitude indicators to give readouts on pitch, yaw and the artificial horizon. There was also a \"fuel\" gauge that reported how much cesium reaction mass was left, but it wasn't really important---no one ever ran out of cesium. Life support and temperature control systems were maintained by a small battery pack. The tiny ships had no actual brakes but they could be flipped around and the main thruster used for deceleration. Under race conditions this was seldom done by any competitor, and never by a winner.\nThe power generators, maneuvering thrusters and cesium fuel tanks were standardized so that each ship carried identical equipment. The ships were also carefully \"weighed\" to insure that their masses were above the minimum limit. Differences in acceleration, maneuverability and speed were due solely to the abilities of the racers themselves.\nThe ships of female contestants carried 100 kilos less mass than those of the males. It was conceded early on that no amount of extra conditioning could quite make up for the slightly superior physical strength of the men. The handicap system worked. Over the years, women had been very competitive in the Marathon.\nAs the days in the week before the race reeled off, the tensions grew ever more intense. The newsvids had special segments devoted to race information several times each day. The race promoters played the emotions of the huge mass of humanity like so many instruments in some huge galactic orchestra.\nTwo days before the race, all of the chase ships with the racers and pit crews, all of the dignitaries in their fine and opulent yachts, all of the sportscasters and their support staff and a huge entourage of assorted fans and hangers-on joined in a huge parade that made its way majestically out to the \"Marathon Cluster\", the site of the famous race course itself. This \"Grande Promenade\", as it was called, took the better part of a day to make the five-thousand kilometer journey out from Ceres. For those who wished to watch it, there was a live video feed from the spaceport on Ceres that showed each ship as it left. Popular vidstars kept up an endless, truly mindless banter about the race, the racers, and the dignitaries. Most of humanity was tuned in. The irresistible strains of the tension symphony continued to play in the background.\nThe final day before the race was spent in last-minute preparations. The Marathon ships were checked over one last time. The contestants, in isolation on board their chase ships, carefully re-examined their race strategies, wondering if anything should be changed. At the end of the day the racers retired, to get what rest they could. Meanwhile, the conductors of the mighty tension orchestra were building up to the final crescendo.\nRace day! All had been tuned to the perfect fevered pitch of excitement. Finally all of the preliminaries were over. It was time! The race was ready to begin!\nThousands of participants were lined up at the start. They would start in waves, with the fastest first and each consecutive wave would start at two minute intervals. Such a staggered start insured that the fastest racers wouldn't have to contend with the inherent dangers of less skillful contestants. Those who were in the first wave were the best in the galaxy---Ramosian, Thorpe, Chen-Lee, the mighty Sharp from Luna, swift and crafty Michaels from the belt and twenty others.\nDuring the race each competitor could easily be identified by the color of their cesium exhaust. On race day a very tiny amount of just the right impurity gave each exhaust the characteristic color of the contestant's home system. Displaying the colors of one's home world was considered a great honor. Holoposters and vids that promoted the race often showed a twisted, tangled, intertwined rainbow of multicolored exhausts outlined against the black velvet backdrop of space as a tightly packed group of racers executed a tight maneuver through one of the bright triangular gates. In addition to its many other assets, the marathon was a very colorful event---literally! Yuri's exhaust was the sky-blue of his home planet, Earth, while Cassandra's was the deep red of New Ceylon. This exhaust was, of course, nearly transparent at close quarters, allowing the pilots maximum visibility.\nTwenty-five multicolored exhaust plumes streamed forth as the first wave was finally given the starting signal.\nA young racer from Sirius IV took the early lead, his sleek ship spewing out the violet color of his homeworld. Yuri purposefully held back; no one knew better than he that 10,000 kilometers was a long race. Besides, many a racer had had a race, a career or even his life cut short from an altercation due to the extreme congestion on the course right after the start.\nChallenges for position remained at a minimum in the early going as a small knot of twelve ships began to outdistance the others. But the ships began jockeying frantically as they came to the first series of tight obstacles. The right position was vital. Coming into a gate at the wrong angle meant that the contestant could miss the next gate, or that he would have to waste valuable energy getting back onto the right line and be outdistanced by the others. In the worst case, he might even hit an asteroid.\nYuri went into the first clump of asteroids in eighth position. He picked the perfect line, one that allowed him to skim just over the surfaces of the jagged rocks in the large cluster and make each of the gates at the same time. With a gentle nudge on the joystick and a furious burst of power, he exited in fifth. Cassandra, who had been running twelfth, suddenly found herself in ninth when the ship right in front of her went wide, colliding with two others. In less than a heartbeat, three racers were in serious trouble as their ships careened wildly off the racing line. One of them, Michaels, the \"home town boy\" from Ceres, used his incredible strength and skill to just make the gate, but his angle was all wrong. He narrowly missed a large, slowly spinning asteroid on the outside edge of the gate. Cassandra held her breath as she watched the yellow wash from Michaels' exhaust brush the pocked surface of the jagged rock. One of the others wasn't quite so lucky. In spite of a valiant, desperate effort, he missed the gate and augered directly into the asteroid. The fragile eggshell of his ship exploded from the horrifying impact into a cloudy smear of fog and debris. Michaels slipped back behind the lead pack, obviously shaken by his narrow escape.\nAs the course got more difficult, Yuri continued to move methodically up through the pack. By the halfway point, he was in second place. He had developed a distinct admiration for the young racer ahead of him: his teammate, Thorpe. The emerald plume from the back of the sleek racing ship never faltered as A.J. swept through each of the increasingly difficult maneuvers. Yuri smiled. Thorpe had learned a lot since joining the team! The champ nodded in approval at the classic lines that the young racer took through the ever more difficult turns. A bit wide going in; cut as close as possible to the apex of the curve; sweep a bit wide going out, the tiny ship all but scraping the hard unyielding surfaces of the rocky obstacles as Thorpe sought the triangular green glow of the next gate.\nSpectators throughout the galaxy held their breath and marveled at the beautiful and deadly minuet that the two men danced through the complex and dangerous series of maneuvers. They made the task look graceful, effortless. This was an illusion. Inside their respective ships the contestants were straining themselves beyond comprehension to maintain the torrid pace, all the while making countless delicate adjustments every second on the flight controls to keep the tiny ship on exactly the right line!\nBehind them, by about five kilometers, Cassandra moved quietly into fifth.\nAnd so it went, hour after grueling hour. Some of the contestants were forced to call for their chase ships as one or another of the hardships of the race caused them to cease their effort. They were the fortunate ones. Others, their minds fogged with fatigue, made the fatal mistake---and paid the ultimate price. For some, it was just bad luck. They happened to be in the way when someone made a mistake, like Michaels had been---in the wrong place at the wrong time. To the soulless asteroids that were hit, it made no difference, perpetrator or victim, both suffered the same cruel fate.\nWith three-quarters of the race well behind him, Yuri made his move. He knew it was now or never, that he had to be in the lead for the final leg. To accomplish this, Yuri had picked his spot well: the famous Pallas tunnel. The \"tunnel\" was the most difficult portion of the course and involved a complicated series of left and right sweeping turns that also involved a substantial change in \"elevation\" between each gate, up and left, down and right, down and left, up and right. To make matters worse, the profusion of large, irregular chunks of rock in this very difficult area meant that most of the gates were blind as well---the racers came upon them abruptly, without warning.\nYuri's long experience and consummate skill made the tunnel the ideal place to make his bid for the lead. Once through this area, all that remained was one more gate and then a straight-line powered sprint to the finish.\nIt was time. In a classic maneuver, Yuri pulled up to where he knew he was visible out of the corner of Thorpe's eye. It was one of the oldest tricks in the book: let your opponent feel your presence right behind him, stick to him, hound him until he makes the one error, the one mistake that will let you through! Yuri smiled again. No doubt about it, Thorpe had really developed! A.J. executed the first series of bends flawlessly, but trying to watch the gates and the rocks and the ever-present ship behind him---all at the same time---was too much to ask. Suddenly, Thorpe's ship bobbled slightly as the awkward position of the next gate surprised him. He made a valiant attempt to make the gate, his green exhaust glowing brightly from the effort. His attempt was successful---but only barely! Luckily he also missed a small boulder-sized asteroid right near the corner of the gate. Thorpe, nearly off the course and on a line that was all wrong, left a huge opening for the Champ to streak past.\nYuri confidently executed the difficult maneuver and just skimmed through the same gate, only his line was perfect. He came out of the tunnel alone. There wasn't a ship within five kilometers of him. Yuri leveled off and fell into the rhythmic pumping of his legs that would take him home. One more gate before the finish line!\nSixty-five percent of the human race got up to stretch, go to the bathroom or to get another drink. It looked like Yuri Ramosian was going to be champion for the third time! Oh well, they thought, at least Thorpe had given him a run for his credits!\nCassandra carved out a line similar to Yuri's and made up a couple of places at the same time, moving her up to third place. Ahead, she could just barely see the blue plume from Yuri's exhaust. Her own red plume intensified as she began to pump the pedals furiously in an attempt to catch the leader. Thorpe was the only contestant between her and Ramosian, but he could do nothing to hold off her charge. His jaw dropped in astonishment as she poured on an unbelievable blast of acceleration that left him behind.\nMeanwhile, Yuri was still giving all he had to increase his speed. He knew the competition was a long way back and he was beginning to feel confident that the win was his. No racer in history had ever made up such a deficit and he, the best racer who had ever competed, was the one they had to catch! But, of course, he hadn't counted on Cassandra.\nShe passed the Champ just before the final gate. Yuri shook his head. Her incredible strength had allowed her to catch up, but she was going much too fast. She'd never make the gate. Sure enough, the exhaust plume from her racing craft faltered for a moment as she seemed to realize it too. The next maneuver took him completely by surprise. Suddenly her ship cartwheeled gracefully over, to travel rear-end first. A flip-turn to decelerate! During a race! Yuri smiled at the bold and novel approach. I'll have to give her credit for that one, he thought, but it'll never work. \"Nice try, Cassandra!\" he said aloud. As expected, he passed her slowed-down ship just on the other side of the gate. Yuri straightened out for the final sprint to the finish.\nNow was the time to dig deep, to find out what was left. Yuri had always been able to somehow save a little for a \"kick\" at the very end. This race was to be no exception. It looked bad for Cassandra---she had lost a great deal of time and speed in her successful effort to make the final gate. That one mistake had dropped her back by about twelve kilometers.\nThe situation did look hopeless, but there was no quit in Cassandra! She went doggedly back to work. With just a hundred kilometers left to the finish, she trailed by ten kilometers. By the time there were fifty left, she trailed by five. Soon, Yuri was taking furtive glances over his shoulder as she continued to come on relentlessly! Sixty-five percent of the human race went back and sat down in front of their vidscreens. This race wasn't over yet!\nWith ten kilometers left, there was no doubt---it would be a photo finish. If Cassandra could keep it up! Yuri could see the finish gate---a flashing neon-blue rectangle---a heartbreakingly short distance away when the yellow and blue craft with the red exhaust plume blew past underneath. The former Champ crossed the finish line, completely spent, in second place! Cassandra's margin of victory was two-tenths of a second, making it the closest Marathon in history. Thorpe, who had hung on to finish third, was more than twenty kilometers behind them.\nAfterwards, after the chase ships had picked them up and they stood on the victor's podium to receive their medals, Yuri sincerely congratulated her on a fine race. He meant every word. It had been a wonderful race, the kind that would be buzzed about for months!\nThe events of the next few days insured that this Marathon would be talked about for years to come.\nTwo days after the race, back on Ceres, Yuri and Thorpe were surprised by a summons from the race authorities. Such an unscheduled meeting was highly irregular. As two of the top three finishers, they were very busy people! During the next two days, there were dozens of social functions to attend and hundreds of minor dignitaries to meet and talk with. Crowning it all was the victory banquet that was to be held the final night where the top three were to be guests at an elaborate dinner and would get to shake the hand of President Tsumaki himself! Half-an-hour later Yuri and Thorpe were at the Marathon Complex. Joining them were Harris Dockett, a harried-looking, slightly overweight, middle-aged Marathon official and Dr. Julius Harbour, the official Marathon Physician.\n\"What's this all about?\" asked Yuri.\n\"Yuri, A.J., you know Dr. Harbour,\" said Dockett. The former champ and his teammate shook hands with the doctor. Dockett pushed a button on his intercom. \"You can send Mr. Quimby in now.\"\n\"Quimby?\" asked Thorpe. \"You mean Morris Quimby?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Dockett, somewhat surprised. \"You know him?\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Thorpe. \"Met him at Killian's Pub. The guy's a Marathon freak, a reg'lar walkin' Comlink!\"\nMorris Quimby, looking very nervous, entered the room, nodded at Thorpe and was introduced to the Champ. Quimby cleared his throat. \"It is truly a pleasure to meet you, Mr Ramosian. I'm an accountant for Federated Metals. I'm also a longtime fan of the Marathon. I even do statistical work-ups on the athletes to assess their performance. It's kind of a hobby with me.\"\nHe stopped and looked from Yuri to the Marathon officials. Dockett nodded his head. Quimby cleared his throat again and continued. \"Last week's contest was won by the young lady, Cassandra Chen-Lee, in what was a very close and thrilling race.\"\n\"The closest and most enjoyable of my career,\" said Yuri. \"Even though I lost.\"\n\"You may have lost, Mr. Ramosian, but perhaps not legally,\" said Quimby, nervously. \"I did some calculations on Chen-Lee's performance yesterday and I found a few things that didn't quite add up.\"\n\"Be careful what you say, Mr. Quimby, every contestant must pass a rigid battery of drug and genetic tests before and after the race. Especially if they win!\" warned Harbour.\n\"I'm aware of that, doctor, nevertheless, my statement stands! I've calculated the amount of energy that she would have needed to make up the distance between Mr. Ramosian and herself on the final straight power sprint to the finish.\" He paused here for greater effect. \"Not even in your record-breaking win of eight years ago did you put out that much energy in such a short time,\" he said, looking at Yuri. \"She beat your best-ever energy output by more than fifteen percent! And that doesn't even include what it must have cost her to do that unprecedented flip turn just before the final gate.\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Yuri, appreciatively. \"That was pretty incredible!\"\n\"As further proof,\" Quimby continued. \"At the weigh-in after the race, there were only two kilograms of cesium left in her tank. Two kilos! She almost ran out, Mr. Ramosian. As you know, no one ever runs out of cesium!\"\nThe Champ shook his head in disbelief.\n\"One more thing,\" said Quimby. \"Mr. Thorpe and I were witnesses at a game she participated in where she demonstrated evidence of an abnormally fast reaction time.\"\nThorpe nodded in agreement.\nYuri looked quizzically at Dockett.\n\"Would you be willing to testify in a court of law about this information, Mr. Quimby?\" asked Dockett, his voice very serious.\n\"In the interest of fair racing, I feel that I must,\" replied Quimby.\n\"Maybe we can avoid all that,\" interjected Harbour. \"Why don't we just get Chen-Lee and that Richter character down here and have me take another look at her.\"\n\"Good idea,\" said Dockett.\nWithin the hour, Cassandra Chen-Lee and Harlow Richter had reported to the complex.\n\"You wish to examine my racer again?\" said Richter indignantly. \"Why?\"\n\"There are some minor discrepancies, Mr. Richter. I'm sure it's nothing,\" soothed Dockett. \"Just a quick check-up by Dr. Harbour and we can all go home. Shouldn't take more than a half hour.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Richter grumpily. \"But please make it quick. We have a million things to do!\"\nTen minutes later they were again in Dockett's office. Dr. Harbour wore a perplexed look.\n\"Her parameters are all within normal limits,\" said the old gray haired doctor. \"I find nothing illegal. But...\"\n\"Good,\" said Richter. \"Then we'll be off for the day's activities.\"\nDr. Harbour still looked doubtful. \"Wait a few more minutes,\" he said. \"I want to take a look at the imaging medscan.\"\nDr. Harbour's \"few minutes\" became an hour, then and hour and a half. Finally he called the entire group back together.\n\"I've found the answer, Harris,\" said the old doctor.\n\"And?\" said Dockett.\n\"Here, take a look at these readings.\"\n\"What are we supposed to see?\"\n\"Not much, at first glance. Like you would expect for a top Marathon contender, Cassandra's readings are all at the high end of normal. But there are a few things here that, to quote Mr. Quimby, `don't quite add up.\"'\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Dockett.\n\"Let me see if I can give you an example. Take a look at Thorpe's printout over here. What's the figure for lung capacity?\"\n\"Um... four point three seven liters. Why?\"\n\"Okay, look at Chen-Lee's.\" Dockett looked at her printout.\n\"Six point five nine?\" said Dockett.\n\"Now---sorry Ms. Chen-Lee---compare her chest to Thorpe's.\"\n\"Hm...Aside from a far more pleasing architecture I'd say there's no way she could have a larger lung capacity than Thorpe.\" said Dockett.\n\"Exactly!\" said Harbour. \"That's one of the things I found when I did a few comparisons! But there's more.\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"As you know, Harris, the Marathon rules state that genetic alterations and use of any but a very small list of drugs by the contestants are strictly forbidden. All my tests show that Cassandra hasn't done any of these things.\"\n\"So, what's the point, Julius?\"\n\"It seems there are other ways to improve performance,\" said the doctor.\n\"Would you mind explaining that,\" said Dockett.\nHarbour smiled and dropped his bomb.\n\"Cassandra Chen-Lee has been extensively modified surgically.\"\n\"Modified?\" said Dockett, shocked. \"How?\"\n\"This is ridiculous!\" interrupted Richter indignantly. \"I came down here in good faith! What kind of nonsense is this?\"\n\"I'd remain calm if I were you, Mr. Richter,\" said Harbour. \"Something very odd is going on here and I assure you we are going to find out what it is. It's also possible that you are in a great deal of trouble!\" Richter made a sound of disgust but backed off. The doctor continued. \"Gather around. This is the readout from the Horvald imaging med-scan, a procedure which we don't normally do for qualifying. Because there's a protest, I did one today.\"\n\"Excellent, Julius,\" said Dockett. \"Just as the rules specify.\"\nThe old doctor pointed to his viewscreen which showed a color-coded, three-dimensional internal view of Cassandra Chen-Lee. The projection could be rotated to any angle and any organ system could be zoomed in on and magnified or highlighted. The view zoomed in on the thoracic region. Cassandra, upset by the accusations and uncomfortable at having her internal anatomy more or less on public display, remained at the back of the group but looked on with a kind of morbid fascination.\n\"To begin with, her lungs have been connected across the bottom and special organic valves have been placed so that air passes completely through both lungs; in through the left lung first, out the bottom, into and up through the right lung before finally being breathed out. There are no dead air spaces like those in an unaltered human's lungs. This modification alone makes her lungs at least ten percent more efficient than normal.\"\nCassandra, her mouth open, wore a look of disturbed wonder.\nHarbour typed a command on the med-scan keyboard and a different portion of the chest region became highlighted. He continued. \"In addition, both her heart and her lungs have been equipped with a number of extra veins and arteries to improve oxygen exchange. This is what threw off my original figures for lung capacity and led me to do a more detailed analysis. To further improve performance, there are extra vessels supplying the large muscles of her legs as well.\" Dockett shook his head in disbelief.\n\"But that's not the end of it. Look at this!\" Harbour typed in another string of commands. The nervous system of the projection became highlighted. \"As if increased endurance weren't enough, she has several tiny biomicroprocessers in her hands and arms that have been connected to a microscopic descrambler inside her skull. The connection has been made with an exquisitely crafted set of delicate, hair-thin gold cables that almost escaped detection. In turn, the descrambler is directly connected to the appropriate areas of her brain. I have never measured a faster reaction time! From brain to hand it is about ten times faster than human normal!\"\nCassandra sat down heavily in Harbour's thickly padded chair, her head in her hands.\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked Dockett, shooting a disproving glance at Richter.\n\"It means that she should have won the race easily, but she must have misjudged the pace and held back a little too much in the early going. As a result, she had to far exceed even superhuman performance to win! Except for that slight miscalculation and, of course, the obscure statistics of Morris Quimby, these modifications may have gone unnoticed.\"\nCassandra was in a state of shock. Distraught, nearly hysterical, she shouted at Richter. \"You said you were going to fix me up after my accident! What have you done to me, Richter?\" Yuri and A.J. tried to calm her down.\n\"Are you responsible for this, Richter?\" asked Dockett.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Incredible techniques!\" said Harbour, unable to hide his admiration. \"Where did you learn?\"\n\"For ten years I was a doctor for General Metals at their infamous Nacobbus VI mining site. A lot of good men got hurt out there. It was my job to fix them up. Often there wasn't much left to work with. Most of them would have died anyway unless we did something. We were forced to try some pretty radical things.\"\n\"What does that have to do with Cassandra?\" asked Harbour.\n\"I'd been patching people up so they could go back to being miners, Dr. Harbour. I wanted to see what my procedures could do for an athlete. Cassandra's accident was the perfect opportunity. I was planning to tell Cassandra and the Marathon committee all about it as soon as the furor surrounding the race died down a bit.\"\n\"You mean this isn't an act? She really doesn't know?\" asked Harbour, in disbelief. Richter nodded his head.\n\"She thought it was an unusual diet and my special exercise program.\"\n\"I thought you were my friend!\" said Cassandra, with an accusing look, her voice still edged with hysteria.\n\"I am your friend, Cassandra,\" said the old man quietly. \"Before your accident you were a good pilot---one of the best---but you lacked the other important physical attributes that would have made you a top Marathoner.\" He put his hand on her shoulder. \"You were a mess after your accident, Cass! Without my intervention, you wouldn't even have been able to walk again, let alone race! My techniques not only gave you back your health, they also made you into a contender. But you're forgetting something, Cassandra: it was your skill and your desire that made you into a winner!\" Richter looked proudly around the room. \"Check the rules, Gentlemen. I believe you will find that we haven't broken any of them!\"\n\"What?\" said Dockett.\n\"He may be right, Harris,\" said the doctor. \"There is a distinct possibility that the rules haven't been broken!\"\nA long and extensive examination of the rule book revealed that Cassandra had indeed broken none of the rules. Remarkably, she was allowed to keep the championship. The rules were rewritten; such modifications to the human body would not be allowed again. Cassandra went numbly through the ceremonies, still in deep emotional shock. Within a few months she had gotten considerably better. Whether or not she ever completely recovered remains unknown. The trophy was a beautifully sculpted cup made of real gold that had been mined from the belt. The inscription read:\nFirst Place\nUnlimited Division\nCeres-Pallas Marathon\nIn the realm of sport that tests\nhuman endurance to its limits,\nthere is no higher award.\nMorris Quimby was offered a position with the lofty title of \"Official Statistician to the Ceres-Pallas Marathon\". He took the job immediately. After all, how many people get a chance to live their dreams?\nArguments over who was the \"real\" winner of the marathon raged in barrooms and betting halls for years afterwards. Yuri Ramosian retired soon after, never to race again. He went on to a career in sports journalism and made enormous sums of money endorsing various athletic products. Some say that it was the controversy over the beautiful and enigmatic Cassandra that made him want to quit. Others say he finally got tired of it. Possibly, but, what they didn't know was that Yuri wasn't a \"normal\" human being himself. It wasn't widely publicized but there's a good chance that the real reason he retired was due to the fact that one of his two hearts was beginning to act up.\nPhil Nolte has been writing Science-Fiction for about three years, although he's been reading and enjoying it for most of his life. He says that, for him, writing started out as \"a lark\" just to see if he could actually do it. Later, he found himself getting more and more serious about it. He still writes at home in his spare time, often when others are totally wasting their time watching dreadful TV sitcoms, etc... His obsession is a better use of time. In addition to fiction, he's also written several science history articles for a local (Red River Valley) trade journal. This is his third story to be printed in Quanta.\nnu020061@vm1.nodak.edu","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

Idly, Gloucester thumbed the edge of a page, as though about to turn to the next one. Then his thumb, sweat stained and tarnished by newsprint, paused perceptively on the cusp of page-turning. The doctor hesitated a moment. A bead of perspiration rolled from the side of his forehead, threatening to wander along his nose then drip, slowly onto the page -- as if to see what all the fuss was about -- but it, too, halted awhile to watch the doctor in his deliberations.\nFirmly, Doctor Gloucester slammed A La Recherche de Temps Perdu closed, but not before the moist bead, its mind made up at the last, had had a chance to zip down onto the page, providing a single greasy bookmark to remind Gloucester where he had got to in the novel.\nDoctor Gloucester glanced about him, and paused awhile once more, in contemplation of what he saw. `A War!' he thought. `A Bore. Such a bore is war, a sore bore, yet not so torn as an apple corn. Which lies, forlorn as though drawn upon a paper.' Drawn, as they were, to the window, the doctor's eyes took in the exterior scene.\nA carriage went by. Another followed it.\n`Something wrong here,' thought Gloucester. `Something definitely wrong. But what? But what?'\n`No horse!' the thought screamed out, but none heard it as none were there to hear. `No horse!' it cried again, but louder this time. Again, none heard its wail -- but more clearly this time.\nThe doctor's eyes rose up, maintaining their position on his face as it -- too -- was raised. This last was caused, as 'twere, by the movement of the good doctor's head, which responded in characteristic fashion to a change in the angle at which his neck was held. So it goes.\nA cloud drifted by, as clouds have been known to do, as the doctor stared from his window. A tendril of cloud caressed another cloud, pulling from it -- gently, oh so gently -- a wisp of likewise cloudy material. A swirl, a whirlpool in the skies, then gone, and only cloud remained.\nThe doctor stared.\nA crick, a cricket, a cricket neck caused Doctor Gloucester to turn away momentarily from the cloudy landscape, and his eye alighted upon a picture beside his desk. The picture showed a herd of sheep, a flock of cows and a shepherd's crook. Around the crook was draped a cobweb, fine as cobweb in the early morning light. The doctor raised his arm, and thereby his hand, to stroke the web, which broke.\nA strand of cobweb fell, slowly, drifting to the floor of the doctor's study. He watched it swirl, a whirlpool in the air, then land and come to rest upon the bare floorboards which cushioned Doctor Gloucester's feet from the bare air beneath.\n`Oh shit,' thought the doctor.\nA creak, a crack, a racket. A cracket of sound disturbed the good doctor's contemplation of the webby fibres, and caused him to turn to the door. The door was opening, slowly, its hinges shrieking as a hundred knife-wounds of rust buried themselves to the hilt in their vulnerable metal bodies. A chink, a chunk, a clank of light shone through, outlining three sides of the door as it swung wider, wider, and wider still, in answer to the hingey cries.\n`Oh shit,' thought the doctor.\nThe door now open, a figure emerged, and entered the room with a tray in one hand and a knife in the other. \"Who's there?\" cried the doctor, his voice betraying the terror he felt in his heart at the sound of the door, and the clank of the light, and the screams of the hinge, \"Who's there?\"\nAnd a voice, soft and low, whispered across that room, \"'Tis eye.\"\nThe doctor stood up, the better to walk, and crossed 'cross the room, he crissed crassly crossed 'cross that room, to greet with his voice the bearer of tray and of knife -- which the reader has yet to learn more of. The doctor addressed that strange apparition with words from his throat, ushered soft from his mouth, though hoarsened by sounds uttered early in panic 'gainst that very shape, \"Who is 'I'?\"\n\"'Tis I, kindly doctor, who bringeth thy supper for you to partake of now daylight has finished.\"\nThe doctor spun round, with a complex manouver, and glared at the window to see the last streaks of the daylight descending like icicles melting beyond the horizon and sighed, like a river, in pain at the passing of a friend.\n\"Who is `I'?\" he repeated, since last time he uttered those words he had got no reply from the figure, bearing knife and a tray which it claimed was his supper. That figure whose entrance had startled the doctor and caused him to miss the moment of passing of day. \"Who is `eye'?\"\nThe person who stood, a-framed in the doorway, looked on to the doctor and noticed his face, and noted his expression, and formed her opinion of what the poor doctor had done all that evening, and looked for the book, the sweat-stain-ed novel, by Marcel Proust, which the doctor was reading, and said to the doctor, \"I'm Mary.\"\nThe doctor was shocked. `Oh shit,' thought the doctor.\nMary stalked forward, she storked t'ward the table, deposited tray and placed there the knife, which she had been carrying, onto the tray. Placed she it. Mary turned now to Gloucester, and stared at his face, expressions of pity vieing for place on her features with shades of expressions of anger that Gloucester had noticed the clouds once again.\n`Oh shit,' thought the doctor.\nThe table groaned lightly.\n`Oh shit,' thought the doctor.\nThen, Mary walked to the doorway, and turned to the doctor, \"Goodnight,\" as the door was closed from the outside, leaving doctor alone with the tray and the table. And the knife. The window was open. Doctor Gloucester left it open, reached for the knife then stabbed his hand downwards to capture a cockroach that crawled 'cross the table t'ward the tray which bore his supper. Gloucester raised the cover and unveiled his meal.\n`Oh shit,' thought the doctor.\nRoy Stead is a research assistant in quantum astrophysics at the English University of Sussex.

It was a dim, reddish ball that, even at noon, only feebly lit the surface. Setting, it seemed an ominous bloody colour. Clouds, chrome, and snow all caught the red hue and reflected it to the giant window, where the Procurator of Museum stood, staring at the horizon. `How appropriate,' she thought. `I am soaked in blood.'\nThe voice relay at her desk interrupted her morose thoughts.\n\"Admiral Perry is here, sir,\" it announced.\n\"Send him in.\"\nA section of the wall turned transparent as the Admiral entered, then blended back into the brown decor once he stepped through. He strode angrily across the room, his face set with determination. He stopped at the desk that divided the room and saluted the Procurator sharply. She returned the gesture with slightly less vigor.\n\"I protest the highly irregular nature of this inquiry,\" snapped the Admiral. \"This is a purely military matter and the introduction of another civilian into the matter, as well as sending myself, Dr.~Drucker, and Captain Huston here, has delayed matters a full month. There will be a number of questions concerning classified knowledge~--- I will have to ask you and Dr.~Drucker to leave for part of the proceedings.\"\n\"Please take a seat, Admiral,\" said the Procurator politely. \"Would you care for a drink?\"\n\"No, thank you,\" replied Admiral Perry gruffly.\nShe sighed. \"Your objections to the setup of this inquiry are noted. The Secretary-General, however, felt that this would be the most appropriate way to handle the matter. I have full authority and both myself and Dr.~Drucker will be present for the entire inquiry. We have been granted the necessary security clearances.\"\nAs she spoke, she pulled a circlet of silver off her finger and passed it to the Admiral. He picked it up and as he examined it, his eyes opened in surprise.\n\"My apologies, your...\"\n\"Not needed,\" interrupted the Procurator as she accepted the ring back. \"You are correct. Making this debriefing a full fledged inquiry and bringing everyone here has been time consuming. Were it not for the unique circumstances, this would all be inappropriate. But too much is at at stake here...\"\n\"Doctor Drucker and Captain Huston are here, sir,\" announced the voice relay.\n\"Let them enter.\"\nThe wall disappeared again and two figures strode through. The taller of the two was a thin man with closely cropped steel gray hair that made him appear elderly. His reputation belied that, however~--- Dr. David Drucker was easily the most famous archaeologist in the Union and his work showed none of the signs of an aging mind.\nCaptain John Huston gave no such appearance of age. Although well into his thirties, he could have been mistaken for a full decade younger. He was solidly built though somewhat stockier. His posture gave the impression of great strength.\n\"Dr.~Drucker, nice to see you again,\" began the Procurator, \"and Captain Huston. Please be seated.\" She indicated the two chairs in front of her desk.\n\"Mr.~Huston,\" corrected John Huston as he sat. \"I've filed for a permanent release and prefer not to use the military title.\"\n\"Has your release been granted yet?\" asked the Procurator.\n\"No, sir, not yet.\"\n\"You will be Captain Huston for the these proceedings, then.\" Before the Captain could utter an objection, the Procurator turned to the Admiral. In response, Admiral Perry pressed a button on a small device he had placed on the table.\n\"These are the proceedings of the debriefing of Captain John Huston, AJN 164,\" began Admiral Perry in a formal tone, \"the current commander of the Federal Starship Nikaljuk, and Dr. David Drucker, the head of the archaeology team involved in the Nikaljuk's most recent mission. Presiding are Admiral Nicholas Perry, BCQ 217, and,\" then the Admiral glanced towards the Procurator, who responded by placing an upright finger across her lips, \"the current Procurator of the planet Museum, Dr. Drucker's employer on the mission under review. These proceedings have commenced on the 14th day of the year 1503 R.A.\"\n\"Thank you, Admiral,\" said the Procurator. \"These proceedings can now progress in an informal manner, although they are being recorded. This is not a military inquiry. The Secretary-General has asked me to participate, so this will not be a normal debriefing either. This is simply an opportunity for you both to report fully on your mission before me.\"\n\"Archaeologists?\" exploded Captain Huston. \"A freight ship? I thought I was working for the Navy! Have we been bought out by Republic Transport? What am I doing shuttling mudhens around when there's a war being fought?\"\nAdmiral Perry sighed. He had expected this --- he and Captain Huston had been friends at the Herculean Naval Academy and John's enthusiasm to come to grips with the Kalganians had been famous even then. Despite that enthusiasm, or perhaps even because of it, Captain Huston had never been assigned to duty on the front. Out on the eastern dust rifts, starships grappled while John Huston had been assigned escort duties deep in the heart of the Federal Union, guarding ships as they plied the star lanes. It was vital work, for without the munitions and supplies, the war would come to a grinding halt and all too few merchants made it to their ports of call unescorted. But no one who knew John Huston could believe he would be satisfied so far from the battle zone.\nUnfortunately, his luck was not about to change. This new mission would take him nowhere near the upstart Empire.\n\"Captain... John, I realize you'd rather be elsewhere, but look at it this way. You'll be doing what you do best, running a ship. On the front, you'd be a fourth class officer or worse. And I know what you think about the glory of war and all, but it isn't all that it's made out to be. It's vicious out there. People die, friends as well as foes. Serving duty here, you'll still be around in two years. We frontliners can't count on that.\"\n\"Fourth class officer?\" snapped Captain Huston. \"Bullshit! You were in the same graduating class as me and look where you are now, all from serving in the war while I've rotted on the sidelines!\"\n\"Oh, I've done well, have I?\" roared Admiral Perry back, suddenly furious. \"Do you know how I got this rank? I tried to save the life of my best junior officer and her crew, breaking half a dozen flight regulations in the attempt... and they PROMOTED me for FAILING! Oh, I destroyed those cruisers when the blundered into the Maelstrom's range. They were just too intent on killing my patrol ship. If they'd looked properly at their instruments, they'd have escaped, the patrollers would be alive, and I'd be court martialed for breaking course and violating acceleration safety limits! And quite frankly, I'd rather be in the brig with my friends alive than Admiral with them dead!\"\nAdmiral Perry stopped and when he spoke again, his voice was much calmer.\n\"Sorry. But believe me: The battlefield is not the place for you. Or anyone. The glory and honour of war is false. It's kill or be killed out there. The Kalganians that murdered my soldiers were simply doing their duty --- did they deserve to die for that? They had families, husbands and wives, children, friends... and their sorrow must be just as painful as the loss of my crew is to me. Think about that before you start sputtering about wanting to fight. There are times when I wonder if all sacrifices will be worth the victory...\n\"Besides,\" and now Admiral Perry was smiling, however artificially, \"think what it would be like if these archaeologists find what they are looking for. It would be quite a discovery and you'd be among the very first to know. And remember, you were selected by Dr. Drucker from a list of highly competent commanders. He wants you.\"\nCaptain Huston was silent. He was still reeling from the verbal assault. Oh, he knew there was more to that incident with the Maelstrom than the news services had told, that both navies had been killers that day. But nothing had prepared him for the intensity of Admiral Perry's feelings. Perhaps there was more to frontline command that met the eye...\nAfter a few moments of silence, Admiral Perry spoke again.\n\"You'll be working in the Betelgeuse sector. It's nicknamed `Beetle Juice' after a supernova remnant near the sector's center. From the right places, the remnant looks just like a giant bug. I know a few of the better viewing angles. I'll give your navigator the co-ordinates before you leave. It should only be a minor deviation from your flight plans and it's worth the visit.\"\n\"Ah,\" said Captain Huston, his composure regained somewhat. \"So I'll be playing the part of a civil captain to the hilt. Passengers and now even sight-seeing. What larks!\"\n\"John,\" replied Admiral Perry sternly, \"you are a military officer and you will obey orders. But the Navy will never order you to enjoy a job. THAT is up to you.\"\nThe Admiral strode out of the room, his footsteps echoing down the hall.\nThree hundred years ago, Ian Nikaljuk had been a stellographer of some note. He was best known for his last mapping expedition, when he ventured beyond the great dust rift of Cygnus. There, behind the cold clouds of interstellar dust, he found a rich bounty of water\/oxygen planets, circling G type primaries --- ideal planets for human colonization, the most precious commodity in the Union. Of these gems, he choose the very best and named it after his wife, Kalgania, then, together with his family, led the first colony ships there.\nHis choice was wise. Within a century, Kalgania dominated the trade of the entire region to such an extent that the whole sector came to be known as Kalgan, and Kalgania was its capital.\n`Yes,' thought Captain Huston. `Of all the ships they could have given me, they hand me one named after the founder of our enemy...' He came to the door he was looking for and pressed the annunciator.\n\"Who is it?\" asked the grill on the wall.\n\"This is Captain John Huston of the Nikaljuk.\"\nThe door snapped into nonexistence and Captain Huston walked through. He had entered a small office, occupied by a tall, thin man with short, steel gray hair. He had been sitting behind his cluttered desk, the floor around him in equal disarray, but as the Captain entered, he stood up and offered his hand.\n\"Welcome, Captain Huston,\" he said. \"I'm David Drucker, the archaeology team leader. Pardon the mess --- I'm still packing. What brings you here from the docks?\"\n\"I have a few questions,\" said Captain Huston, starting to shift back towards the door, \"but nothing that can't wait `til later.\"\n\"Oh, that should be no problem,\" said Dr. Drucker. \"I can spare you some time, though not much. What do you want to know?\"\n\"Well,\" began Captain Huston, \"why us?\"\n\"Didn't they tell you?\" asked Dr. Drucker. \"Your crew came with the highest recommendations. I appreciate excellence.\"\n\"Well, thank you,\" said Captain Huston, nodding his head with the compliment. \"But that's not what I meant. Why the Navy? Wouldn't a civil freight liner suit your needs better?\"\n\"Ah, a complete answer would take some time,\" replied Dr. Drucker, settling back into his seat, his proclaimed busy-ness apparently forgotten. \"Please take a chair. Just move the papers onto the floor.\" Captain Huston lifted a small pile of printed pages off the only other chair in the room and put them on the floor before sitting. `Printed paper?' he thought. `An anachronism, but then you might expect that from an archaeologist.'\n\"In short,\" continued Dr. Drucker, \"the reason is flexibility. Civilian ships depend on a network of subsidiary services: space stations, shuttles, and the like. The military does not rely on such sundry items as not all their destinations are serviced by those middlemen. The Nikaljuk, for instance, has landed right here on Museum for loading. It can take off directly, cruise through interplanetary space, then switch over to the hyperdrive once it reaches deep space. A civil freighter of similar dimension could hold almost twice the Nikaljuk's capacity, but is not equipped with an interplanetary engine plant.\"\n\"But there are interplanetary shuttles serving every inhabited planet in the Union!\" exclaimed Captain Huston.\n\"Yes, every INHABITED planet,\" replied Dr. Drucker. \"But not abandoned planets.\"\n\"Abandoned planets?\" asked Captain Huston. \"What is there of interest in a place even colonists gave up on?\"\n\"Planets have been ill-chosen by colonizing parties since humanity first took to space,\" explained Dr. Drucker. \"After being abandoned, virtually all of those planets have suffered no further disturbances from humans. Colonists tend not to make the same mistake twice. Since, of all the agents that destroy archaeological evidence, humans are the most potent, the likelihood of finding interesting remains is better on those planets, save where abandonment was due to violent weather or geology. By sifting the remains, we could find some of the clues we are looking for.\"\n\"I'm afraid my briefing was limited,\" said Captain Huston. \"What is this `First World' we'll be looking for?\"\n\"It is current theory that there is one, or possibly two or three planets from which all humanity sprung,\" began Dr. Drucker. \"It is based on some complex anthropological studies. Among other things, those studies show there once were three distinct classes of human skeletons. Time and intermarriage has blended most of the distinctions in modern humans, but sufficiently detailed genetic analysis can still trace contemporary skeletons to those three bone types. Some presume on that basis that there were three separate planets on which humanity evolved. Others, such as myself, find the interfertility of those three races suggestive of a single planetary origin. All humanity developed there and began to colonize soon after developing space travel. Our team is trying to find further evidence to support the single planetary origin hypothesis, and to find that planet.\"\n\"But why this mission?\" asked Captain Huston. \"Couldn't you simply examine the histories and find which one has records predating space travel?\"\nDr. Drucker shifted in his seat. \"A sensible suggestion. In fact, that is exactly what we have spent the last ten years doing. Do you have any idea how many planets claim to be the first?\"\n\"A few dozen?\" suggested Captain Huston.\n\"A few dozen per sector!\" exclaimed Dr. Drucker. \"There are thousands of planets that have histories extending from before the establishment of the Federal Union, and virtually all of those planets claim they have always been inhabited. Some claims were easy to eliminate, other were more difficult... and eventually, not a single one of them passed every test we could devise. Archaeological diggings found that, even at the most ancient sites, there was evidence of space age technology. Anything older predated human habitation.\"\nDr. Drucker sighed. \"Our best guess now is that the planet in question is unaware of its special status.\"\n\"But how could a planet be the source of all civilization, yet think it was not?\" inquired Captain Huston, finding himself suddenly intrigued. He had come to Dr. Drucker's office more to please Admiral Perry than in any genuine belief that the mission would prove interesting. He was glad now the Admiral had pressured him into getting more involved. I guess I owe him an apology, though the Captain.\n\"That is one of the mysteries that has made this project so complex,\" answered Dr. Drucker.\n\"Is there some special reason for choosing the Betelgeuse sector?\" asked Captain Huston.\n\"Oh, a very special reason,\" replied Dr. Drucker. \"We made a breakthrough a few months ago, one which made this mission feasible. Come with me and I'll show you.\"\nGlittering in the bright lights that shone down on it lay a metallic box adorned with three long arms and a large bowl. A pair of technicians were carefully replacing a side panel when Dr. Drucker and the Captain entered the room onto the ramp that ran around the room's length, ten feet off the floor.\n\"This is it,\" said Dr. Drucker waving at the object on the floor. \"A military convoy crossing the sector stumbled across it drifting in deep space. It appears to be a probe of some sort. Unmistakably a human creation --- there's a pair of human figures, male and female, on one of the external panels, along with some other etched marks that we haven't been able to decipher.\n\"Notice the big dish? It's parabolic, with an electromagnetic sender at its focus. Because of the time lags inherent in electromagnetic communication over astronomical distances, we're fairly confident that the probe was designed with an interplanetary mission in mind. The size of the power supply backs that conclusion up. Even with a fresh fuel sources, it could only send a very weak signal.\"\n\"So what makes this a breakthrough?\" ask Captain Huston.\n\"Why send a probe for an interplanetary mission? It has no drive system save for some low power maneuvering jets, and there's no evidence of one ever having been attached to it. A ballistic probe in an age of powered flight between the stars? Senseless!\n\"Besides, the instruments are rather primitive looking as such things go. The people who built them could teach us some things about miniaturization, but the technology is simplistic.\n\"The real clincher, though, was radioactively dating a sample from one of the fuel cells. The probe was powered by a simple nuclear electric generator, so by assuming the fuel was reasonably pure when it was launched, we can determine its age by measuring the radioactivity of the cell now. Other tests, like measuring the interstellar dust coating, confirm the result. This probe is over ten thousand years old: The oldest man-made find ever.\n\"We're very lucky to have this. Something like this on a planet would have weathered beyond recognition. But deep space is a rather good preservative. There's been some scoring and organic molecules from the interstellar medium have done some damage, but otherwise, it's practically in the same condition as when its makers first tossed in into space.\"\nCaptain Huston look at the probe below him with new respect. Ten thousand years old, yet still recognizable, just drifting through space...\n\"If this was a ballistic probe,\" said Captain Huston, \"then you could backtrack its course from where it was picked up.\"\nDr. Drucker sighed. \"Indeed you could, and this mission would be very simple. Alas, the ship that picked up the probe suffered a partial power failure. All their navigation log data was lost. We know the probe could not have been traveling past light speed --- it's doesn't have the Hollings field generator necessary to defeat relativistic destruction. Nor was it traveling near light speed: if it had been, the damage from colliding with interstellar dust would have been much more extensive.\n\"But that is all we know. It could have been traveling at mere metres per second, or hundreds of kilometres. Over ten thousand years, that adds up to a lot of uncertainty... and the region that uncertainty spans is our search volume. Right in the heart of the Betelgeuse sector.\"\n\"Are there any inhabited planets there?\" asked Captain Huston.\n\"Yes,\" replied Dr. Drucker, \"Turkenstan. We've already been there. It was one of the planets that claimed to be the original and one whose claim could not be dismissed immediately. But Turkenstan was not it. It must have been one of the first colonies, since one team found remains from an ancient starship shuttle which were over nine thousand years old. But there's no trace of human habitation earlier than that find.\"\nCaptain Huston scratched his head. \"Anything near this region? Perhaps the error margins were underestimated when guessing the probe's trajectory at its pickup.\"\nDr. Drucker smiled. \"Ever thought of becoming an archaeologist? You're asking all the right questions... But to answer your question: yes. There are two inhabited planets nearby. Both have clear records of their colonization. The older, a place called Janella, is a pre-imperial planet. Its settlers arrived there about four and a half thousand years ago. They had to terraform it to make life outside enclosed cities possible, but they eventually did make the surface livable after a fashion. A very cold place most of its year, but still better than here.\"\n`You can say that again,' thought Captain Huston. `The surface of Museum is so miserable that the population all burrowed beneath the crust. What a way to live!'\nMuseum had been overlooked by colonists precisely because of its inhospitable climate. Even the starship captains who regularly visited the system after the orbital refueling station had been built two hundred years ago knew it only as a zipcode in the sky. The planet didn't even have a name until the Republic Historian's Guild had applied to turn the planet into a public library specializing in the Union's history. Terraforming the planet's climate was too expensive, so the historians had contented themselves with honeycombing the crust with underground tunnels and rooms. A few building tops poked above the surface, but by and large, the bulk of Muesum's habitation was deep in the planetary crust.\n\"The other planet, Srosa,\" continued Dr. Drucker, \"was subsequently settled by Janella. We'll be dropping off teams at both planets to see if there's any more elderly records to be found. But that does seem a long shot.\"\n\"And if those teams don't find anything?\"\n\"Then we'll look for abandoned planets. Since the original home is somewhere in there, it seems reasonable that there would be planets settled early on, planets that might well have been abandoned as wider ranging surveys found better places. Of course, there's no record of any such planets, but then again, you wouldn't expect to find much after so long.\"\n\"So how will you find them? There must be a lot of stars in the search region and over 30% of all stars have planets.\"\n\"The region the probe came from has been surveyed, so we've already narrowed the field down somewhat. There are a few planets that are marginally habitable which might have been settled early on. In particular, there are two G type and three F type stars with oxygen\/water planets orbiting within the acceptable orbital parameters. The Fs would be long shots --- the only populated planets with F primaries have very heavy radiation trapping zones and even so, they can be pretty grim places to live. But the very first colonists may not have been so picky... or aware of the consequences of living on a planet with such a high flux of energetic nuclear particles.\"\nCaptain Huston frowned slightly. Something was still out of place, a fact being overlooked... `Ah, yes.'\n\"That will find you early settlements. But that's not ultimately what you're looking for. What about this First World? If there's only one currently inhabited planet around where this probe came from and it's definitely not First World, then where's the missing planet?\"\n\"Well, I can think of only two possibilities. First World may have been abandoned, which seems bloody unlikely. Why abandon a planet that must have been so well suited to life? It makes no sense...\"\n\"And the other possibility?\" asked Captain Huston.\n\"First World is still out there in the Betelgeuse sector... and the Federal Union doesn't know about it.\"\nCaptain Huston knocked on the wall paneling lightly. He had come down to the spare cargo bay where the archaeologists were housed on the doctor's request. It was the first time he had been in this part of the ship since the engineers had installed the temporary quarters. They had done a good job in the short time available, but there was no mistaking the partition walls for anything permanent. If he had knocked a little harder, the Captain was sure, the whole wall would have shook. The door to Dr. Drucker's room was nothing more than a curtain.\n\"Come in.\"\nCaptain Huston expected the interior of the archaeologist's room to look as temporary as its exterior, but he was surprised. This was not a room --- it was somebody's home. The hammock was neatly rolled out of the way and the walls were covered with framed trimenographs, posters, and news clippings. The most striking of these was a large trimenograph facing the door. It was a picture of a nebula, apparently floating in the wall. It had a striking sense of depth even though the image plate was flat. The cloud had twisted arcs of glowing gases stretching out into space, so realistic that Captain Huston had a momentary vision of the arms reaching out and grabbing him. Swirls of bluish oxygen mixed with the yellow-orange of hydrogen, all spread across the inky blackness in the shape of...\n\"Looks rather like a bug, doesn't it?\" remarked Dr. Drucker. He was accustomed to the startled look the image drew from visitors. Trimenographs were nothing new, but few were quite as startling as this one. The sense of depth was so strong that it appeared there was a hole in the wall in which the plasma cloud hung. One friend had even tried touching the nebular formation, not fully comprehending the true nature of the image until his hand had struck the plate on the wall.\n\"The `Beetle Juice' supernova remnant?\" asked the Captain.\n\"Yes,\" answered Dr. Drucker. \"My daughter had a rather strong love of space travel. She made a number of trimenographs of astronomical objects to share her enthusiasm for space... and she succeeded. Not only has she captured the three dimensional sense of the remnant extraordinarily well, but the view is also taken from an unusual viewing angle which she calculated for herself. Her line of sight makes the remnant less bright overall but accents the outer regions. The higher oxygen content from this angle strengthens the blue, enhancing the appearance... But pardon me, Captain. As I said, this is one of Marguerite's greater successes and I am prone to play the part of the proud father.\"\n\"Oh, that's quite all right,\" said Captain Huston, breaking his eyes from the trimenograph. \"Your daughter is to be complimented. It is one of the best trimenographs I've seen taken from space. One of the best I've seen at all, in fact. In a few days, we can even compare it to the real thing.\"\n\"We'll be visiting the remnant?\" asked Dr. Drucker, a hint of hopefulness in his voice.\n\"Yes,\" confirmed Captain Huston. \"Admiral Perry ordered me to stop there while we were in the sector.\" Then the Captain paused for a moment. \"Actually, it wasn't so much an order as a strongly worded suggestion, but he did give me the co-ordinates for the best viewing angle. One of his junior officers apparently had computed a better perspective than the standard angle tourists see.\"\n\"Admiral Nicholas Perry?\" asked Dr. Drucker.\n\"Yes. Do you know him?\"\n\"You're right about comparing this,\" and the Doctor indicated the trimenograph with a sweep of his hand, \"to the real thing. That junior officer probably was my daughter!\"\n\"Your daughter serves under Admiral Perry? Small Universe!\"\n\"The Admiral was a Commander when she was in his service, but yes. Margie was one of his junior lieutenants.\"\n\"Was? Has she moved on to her own command now?\"\nDr. Drucker breathed in deeply.\n\"No. She was killed a couple of years ago on a patrol mission.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Captain Huston, suddenly feeling very awkward. `You've really put your foot in it this time, John,' he thought. There was a long silence, then Dr. Drucker broke the quiet.\n\"The war has not been kind to me. But that is in the past now. And though I would much rather have my daughter alive, it has made all this possible.\"\n\"Oh?\" said Captain Huston, failing to see the connection and befuddled by the sudden awkwardness of his position.\n\"Yes. Admiral Perry and Margie were good friends and he blamed himself for her death. Not justly, I should add: There was nothing anyone have done to save her and she realized the risks when she signed up. However, he has not forgiven himself for his supposed failure yet and thus feels he owes me a debt as her father. He heard of my interest in this mission and pulled a few strings on my behalf.\"\nCaptain Huston remembered the Admiral's explosion, simultaneously noticing a medallion hung above Dr. Drucker's desk. The certificate read \"For bravery in the service of the Federal Union, Lieutenant Marguerite Drucker is awarded the Silver Swords,\" beneath which was the seal of the Secretary-General. `Silver Swords,' thought Captain Huston. `The same medal Commander Perry was given for the incident with the Maelstrom...' Then all the pieces fell into place.\n`What do I say now? \"Your daughter served her nation well?\" The Silver Swords already says that better than I ever could. \"I'm sorry?\" I've already said that. Damn it! War is supposed to be simple. There's an enemy to be defeated. Not without cost, but everyone dies eventually and what better way to go than in the service of the people? But how do I say that to the face of the father of a fallen soldier?'\n`And if I can't say it to his face, is it really true?' Like many wartime military college graduates, he had not really ever been forced to consider the human side of war. `What do I do now? Change the subject?'\nDr. Drucker solved the Captain's dilemma for him.\n\"I've had the trimenograph for almost ten years now, but I've never seen the real thing. That will be something to look forward to. I wonder if it will look any different?\"\n\"Not much,\" answered the Captain with some awkwardness. \"In ten years, the remnant will have expanded several million kilometres and radiated away more energy than an entire planet consumes in the same time. But compared to its total size and power, those changes are miniscule. They would take a trained eye or professional equipment to notice.\n\"I've never been out this way before, but I've heard about the nebula. Judging by your trimen, it will be every bit as spectacular a sight as I've heard.\n\"But I presume you didn't call for me to discuss supernovae,\" continued Captain Huston steering the conversation further from its morose turn. \"What's up?\"\n\"Have you ever played Knights & Castles, Captain?\"\n\"Yes, it was all the rage when I was in school. I managed to get reasonably good, though I've not had much time for it since. Do I detect a challenge?\"\n\"You catch on fast,\" said Dr. Drucker with pleasure, both from the change in conversation and his own scheming. He did not need to be told that Captain Huston played the game. Admiral Perry had mentioned Huston's nickname `The Dark Master' which he had earned ten years ago for his prowess at the game. Ever since Dr. Drucker had heard, he had been looking forward to this challenge. He had tried to play against others on Museum, but few showed much interest and only the Procurator had proven a worthy opponent... and she was too busy to play frequently.\n\"But,\" continued Dr. Drucker, \"I'm not exactly challenging you to a game of Knights & Castles. Our archaeology team on Turkenstan discovered a manual to a similar game that the original colonists played. I've not had a chance to really study it carefully yet, but it's more complex than Knights & Castles, demanding more thought and patience to play properly. Janella spaceport is many days away, however, and I thought a military strategist such as yourself might be interested. A battlefield for you, of sorts. Admiral Perry hinted that you were rather the fighting type and our mission otherwise is most peaceful. Interested?\"\n\"With an introduction like that,\" replied Captain Huston almost jocularly, \"how can I refuse? Kind of living history. How does it work?\"\n\"As I said, it's similar to Knights & Castles, but it's played on a two dimensional grid instead of a cube. The pieces move in more complex fashions. The Turkenstan colonists called it `Chess'...\"\nThe F.S. Nikaljuk hung a mere parsec from the supernova remnant. As Captain Huston had predicted, it looked just like the trimenograph, though it was even more impressive, filling a full quarter of the sky. Even from this close, the nebula's expansion rate of over a thousand kilometres per second was invisible. Seven hundred years ago, this had been a red giant star. The hydrogen in its core had all long since been fused to helium, and thence to carbon, then oxygen, and so on to iron. There, everything stopped. Beyond iron, fusion consumed more energy than it produced and so the star stopped burning. No longer supported by the tremendous radiation pressure from fusion at its core, the outer layers of the star collapsed inward, releasing their gravitational energy as they fell.\nThe resultant explosion defied imagination. The name `supernova' hardly gave a hint of the incredible blast of energy that was released in the mighty detonation of truly astronomical proportions. As the stellar surface fell in, the gases heated and fused. The star's iron core was crushed to the density of an atomic nucleus while the outer layers were flung back out into space with such violence that even now, they outstripped the fastest interplanetary yachts. And the interstellar hyperdrive, the only man-made engine that could rival that fantastic speed, would not operate in the plasma of the explosion. The Nikaljuk was as close as any ship could safely get.\nThe resemblance to a terrestrial insect was remarkable. There were legs made of glowing filaments of excited gases. Captain Huston would not have been surprised had the antennae-like loops of hydrogen started wavering around, exploring, poking. What if it took to life and started crawling across the inky void, a monstrous interstellar bug? Captain Huston suddenly chuckled.\n\"Something humorous?\" asked Dr. Drucker dryly from the Captain's side, looking out the window from the observation deck.\n\"I was just imagining what it would take to kill a bug of this size. An enormous foot, perhaps?\"\nThe Doctor made no response.\n\"Okay,\" admitted the Captain, \"so it's a little strange. Who said I didn't have a twisted mind?\"\nThe Doctor smiled slightly, but maintained his silence.\n\"You said there were only two explanations for the absences of any records of the original planet,\" said Captain Huston, trying to break the silence of his companion. \"Have you considered this possibility?\" and Captain Huston waved his hand at the sight out the window.\n\"Sorry?\" said Dr. Drucker, startled from his silence. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"Well,\" said Captain Huston. \"We are well within the Betelgeuse sector. Consider for a moment that First World orbited this star. During the supernova explosion, the planet would have been vapourized completely. Of course, the inhabitants would have known about the impending explosion and would have been long gone. Long enough that records of their exodus were not front page news. No more planet, hence no planet with records extending before star travel, and also no records of having existed prior to the Federal Union.\"\nDr. Drucker frowned for a moment. \"You know, I never thought of that. But the nebula is well outside our search volume. The probe could not have come from here and we are all agreed that the probe came from First World.\"\n\"We are deep within the Betelgeuse sector,\" said Captain Huston, \"and not that far from the nearest edge of the search volume. Perhaps the error margins on the probe's direction and speed were underestimated?\"\n\"Ha!\" snorted Dr. Drucker. \"If anything, they have been overestimated. We were quite generous in applying uncertainties. And I question calling ten parsecs `not that far.' It would take a light beam over thirty two years to get from here to the nearest edge of the search region.\"\n\"A systematic error? Perhaps an undiscovered black hole that the probe passed close by?\"\n\"I said the error margins were generous!\" replied Dr. Drucker. \"It was precisely because of such factors that they are so large! If you can come up with something plausible to throw our calculations that much off, I'd like to hear about it.\" Then his eyes narrowed. \"You seem unusually keen on this idea. What are you up to?\"\n\"You caught on fast,\" said Captain Huston, smiling as he aped the archaeologist's earlier words. \"Let's just say there's a sum of money involved.\"\nThen Dr. Drucker suddenly grinned. \"Of course! How stupid of me. Habitable planets only have a certain narrow range of stellar type primaries. Supernova progenitors are not among those. They are more massive stars, red giants and the like. Stars that eventually go bang like this,\" and Dr. Drucker indicated the remnant, \"are known for hundreds of thousands of years of distinctly anti-social stellar activity. Violent flares, mass loss, intense microwave laser emission from surrounding gas and dust, you name it. You wouldn't want to get near one of these stars even ten thousand years before the bang.\n\"A sum of money, you say? Have you been making bets on me?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the Captain, \"and I just won. My navigator suggested the supernova destroyed the planet we're searching for. I suspect Georgia was just teasing me, seeing if I knew why it wasn't a possibility. After failing to trip me up, she put a hundred rials on you not seeing it.\"\n\"Does she do this sort of thing regularly?\" asked the somewhat astonished archaeologist.\n\"Oh, quite regularly,\" replied the Captain, \"as does the rest of the crew. This is a small ship and that makes for a lot of frustrated energy with no space to vent it. I can either have friendly competitions or much more serious bickering. As long as the games don't interfere with the bridge, I tolerate it --- sometimes, even encourage it.\n\"Besides, it gives me an intellectual battlefield of sorts. The crew sets me up with some sort of idea with a plausible appearance yet with a built-in flaw... like the properties of a supernova progenitor. I try to find the flaw. For my part, I occasionally set them some task that's supposed to be impossible and see if they can find what I've pulled on them... or if they can fool me into believing it's possible anyway.\n\"Right now, one of the junior engineers is working on constructing a stealth device for the Nikaljuk. Some time soon, he's going to realize that a conventional device takes about twenty times the capacity of our onboard power, not to mention the sheer physical size of the thing. I wouldn't be surprised if he knew that before I even set the task. So he's going to come up with something a little nonconventional. I suspect it will fake a cloaking device from the bridge's perspective, but will have no actual effect on another ship's scanners. Thus he turns it on its head for me to work out what he's really done.\n\"It's wonderful when you really think about it. I hardly have to work to keep them busy and I get constant feedback on my skills. If someone catches me unawares, then I learn something new. And I have to teach myself a lot just to make sure that doesn't happen. Like stellar evolution.\"\n\"Ugh!\" said Dr. Drucker. \"There's more to commanding a ship than I would ever have guessed. I'm glad I'm not doing it, stuck on this tiny can for months on end.\"\n\"Tiny?\" asked Captain Huston. \"I admit this is no giant lumbering tanker, but tiny does seem to overstate it a little. We've got two dozen on board --- there are pleasure yachts that seem crammed with just one.\"\n\"Tiny in comparison,\" replied Dr. Drucker, warming to his line of attack. \"I'm used to thinking of ships carrying tens of thousands rather than the smattering aboard the Nikaljuk.\"\n\"Tens of thousands!\" said Captain Huston. \"I think you mean tens of thousands cubic displacement, not tens of thousands of people. Even the largest deep space carrier, the Haiphong, holds fifteen hundred and it's the biggest starship ever!\"\n\"The Haiphong is NOT the largest starship ever built,\" answered Dr. Drucker happily. \"The shuttle we found at Turkenstan clearly predates translight travel. Therefore, the first colonists had to practically make an entire world to live in while they traveled between the stars. Farming, industry, government, the lot. Their journeys took hundreds of years. The original flight crew would have had grandchildren by the time they reached their destination. The smallest number of people capable of making such a fully self-sufficient world is fifteen thousand. And that's just a minimum. Ships ten, twenty, maybe even fifty times the Haiphong's capacity plied the star lanes for at least a thousand years. Compared to one of those ships, the Nikaljuk is nothing more than a gnat.\n\"Perhaps you should follow your lesson in stellar evolution with a history of space travel,\" and with that, the archaeologist left.\nCaptain Huston stood in apparent silence, looking at the supernova remnant out the window. But someone standing close might have noticed a slight chuckling.\n`So Chess is not the only game this man will play with me,' he thought to himself.\nJesse Allen is an overworked, underloved graduate student at the University of Iowa.

Or rather, a knock on the wall next to the door--the door itself was open.\n\"There's no need to knock, Dr. Drucker,\" said Captain Huston. \"In the Navy, an open door is an invitation. Come on in.\"\nDr. Drucker entered, then seemed startled when he saw Captain Huston was not alone. With him was Captain Second Rank J`ali Suliman.\n\"If you're both here,\" started Dr. Drucker, \"who's on the bridge?\"\n\"Relax, Dr. Drucker,\" replied Captain Huston, amused by the archaeologist's concern. \"The bridge is less than twenty seconds down the hall. Chief Navigator Smythe is in command. She has intentions of future command, so I deemed it appropriate to introduce her to the throne.\"\n\"Don't believe him,\" cautioned Captain Suliman, his teeth showing as he smiled broadly. \"He's just afraid of failing to catch that prankster Jones in the act of pulling the wool over his eyes. So he put Georgia in command while Jones installed the gadget.\"\n\"J`ali,\" said Captain Huston, turning to speak with his second, \"you truly hurt me with your disrespect. Of course I put Georgia in command while Jones put the shield modifier in. I'd hardly be giving her a fair feel for command if she wasn't handed something a little unusual during her watch.\"\n\"Go ahead and make excuses,\" said Suliman, \"but I know you better, John. Your style of command is to leave someone else to hold the bag whenever possible. You know it. I know it. And you know I know it.\"\n\"If you're done assaulting my good character,\" replied Captain Huston playfully, \"I should remind you that she is replacing you, not I, in the Captain's seat right now. Perhaps you'd like to test Jones's creation yourself?\"\n\"No,\" said Suliman, \"I respect your decisions completely. You are, of course, completely correct to leave a junior officer in command while an engineer with even less experience than the acting captain is tinkering with the hyperionic shields.\n\"You must excuse me, sirs,\" Suliman continued, \"but I have other matters to attend to.\" With that, he began to leave the room.\n\"Remember, J`ali,\" retorted Huston gleefully, \"this was your watch. You know it. I know it. And you know I know it.\" Captain Suliman did not even pause as he walked out the door, but Dr. Drucker though he heard a slight snigger from down the hall moments later.\n\"What was all that about?\" asked the incredulous Doctor.\n\"Oh, just J`ali and I playing games with each other and the crew as usual. I left Georgia on the bridge while Warwick Jones, the junior engineer I mentioned earlier, puts his stealth system in.\"\n\"That should be interesting,\" said Dr. Drucker.\n\"Indeed,\" said Captain Huston. \"What's worse, I'm not really sure if Warwick is pulling my leg or not. Usually I can tell such things and then it's just a matter of working out how they're doing it. But Warwick is new and I can't read him as well. Worse, engineering is not my forte. Warwick's compounded the problem by being very thorough in describing the thing's limits. Apparently, a lot of the power and size of standard electronic stealth systems comes from their countermeasures defense circuits---the part of the gadget that keeps other equipment, particularly other ships, from scrambling the cloaking shield. By cutting that out and trimming a few other corners, he says he's saved enough power and space to fit it. Given the thoroughness of his description of the gadget's flaws, I'm tempted to believe him. I do not, however, intend to give in to that temptation easily.\"\n\"And Captain Suliman's claim that you gave Lieutenant Smythe the con while Jones was at work to dodge responsibility?\"\nThe Captain smiled. \"I see you've caught on to some of the ropes. Yes, there is some truth to it. I've just spent the last three days checking up on Warwick's claim that most of the power goes into counter-scrambling. I was sure that was where he laid a trap for me...and I've just managed to learn enough to believe him after all. At least whatever logical pitfall he's laid for me isn't there. So I need more time to search engineering texts to detect other possible tricks.\n\"But it is just as much a challenge to Georgia as it is me dodging Warwick. You see, she now has the task of proving her ability to command and she knows she'll get quite a recommendation from me if she can find out what Jones has really done before I do.\n\"If, on the other hand, I work it out when I go on duty in a few hours after she has failed, I'll gloat unmercifully.\"\n\"I will feel sorry for Lieutenant Smythe should that happen,\" said Dr. Drucker. \"I know just how unmerciful your gloating can be.\"\nSo far, the Captain and Dr. Drucker had completed three games of Chess, all three of which the Captain had won. Dr. Drucker had watched in horror as his pieces were chopped off the board in bold moves that left his King stripped of all protection. All his defensive moves had been countered ruthlessly.\n`I had not counted on such an aggressive opponent,' though the archaeologist. `But with each game, his victory comes harder. I am learning his style...'\n\"It's bad manners not to gloat when someone else challenges you to a game and then proceeds to lose repeatedly,\" said Captain Huston in a mock self-satisfied tone. \"I believe it is your move now.\"\n\"I know,\" said Dr. Drucker with equal mockery. \"I shall enjoy wiping that grin off your face. Bishop to Queen 7. Check.\"\n\"Feeling assertive today?\" said Captain Huston. \"Well, let's see what I can do about that. Check, you say?\" and the Captain moved over to the side table that now held the chess board. Real pieces of either blackened or bleached steel on the wooden board rather than the holographic projections common to most Knights & Castles games. Yet another anachronism, but it seemed appropriate to play the ancient game by hand. Captain Huston moved a steel bishop to its new position. He contemplated the board silently for several minutes with his hand still on the piece, Dr. Drucker standing across the board to see what happened.\n`He plans at least three moves ahead of me,' thought Dr. Drucker, `and undoubtly knows exactly where he wants to move now and is just playing with me by pretending to work out moves as he goes. But he has a surprise coming to him...'\nCaptain Huston reached forward and moved one of his pale pieces, taking the grey bishop off the board. Without even waiting a moment, Dr. Drucker reached down and moved another dark piece.\n\"Check,\" he announced.\nCaptain Huston looked up at the archaeologist with an expression that was a mix of surprise and a frown. `Now what's he got up his sleeve?' thought the Captain. `He's not usually aggressive at all and it's obvious he's plotted his moves out in advance. He's not even TRYING to hide it!' John contemplated the board carefully, then moved one of his pieces to take the attacking rook. Again Dr. Drucker did not wait, but moved his piece immediately.\n\"Check.\"\n`What the hell?' though Captain Huston. `If I take his piece again, he'll have three less than he did five minutes ago without improving his position at all. What is he up to?' Then suddenly, John saw the strategy. `Sneaky fox! If I take the bishop he's using to put me in check, I'll have set myself up to lose all three of those pieces. He's not attacking the King: He's after my playing pieces! But how to counter him...'\nDr. Drucker read the Captain's thoughts from the frowns crossing his forehead and his eye movements across the board. A full half hour passed without a word or move. Dr. Drucker smiled to himself. `I have finally gauged him well,' he thought. `I knew he would attack those pieces, yet realize within a few moves that he places his own in jeopardy. Yes, I've finally rattled `the Dark Master's' cage.'\n\"Jaffles, John,\" said the ship's cook who had entered soundlessly to peek over the chief archaeologist's shoulder. \"And a pot of coroco. I just ran some up to the bridge and Georgia thought you might want some too. Oh, and she told me to tell you `Warwick's little gadget works,' whatever that means.\"\n\"Thanks, Theo,\" said the Captain as the cook placed the food on the side table. \"Smells good.\"\n\"Oceanian cooking always does,\" replied Theo. \"Playing games again? Watch it, Doctor. John has a mean streak and he plays to win.\"\nWith that, the cook disappeared as silently as he entered.\n\"Do all your crew use first names like that?\" asked Dr. Drucker.\n\"Of course,\" replied Captain Huston. \"Discipline and formal titles are all very wonderful for parades. But off duty, I'm a person, not a Captain, and I like being treated that way. You'll find most of the crew feel that way too.\n\"In fact, it might be good practice for you and your team to use first names when we're off duty, David.\"\n\"Oh,\" replied the archaeologist, \"of course. We always try to adjust to the local customs, Capt...John. I simply hadn't realized. I would never have imagined the military was quite so... well, human. Margie always gave me the impression discipline was a bit on the strict side onboard.\"\nJohn Huston laughed. \"Doesn't surprise me if she was serving with Nick Perry. He's as good as they come, but he's from the Hercules sector and they take discipline a bit seriously there. I'm from Oceania and we've always been a bit more relaxed about such things. Got better grub, too,\" and as he spoke, he poured a cup from the pot. \"Want some?\"\n\"Grub?\" asked David.\n\"Sorry. Local slang for `food.' \"\n\"I'm afraid I'm not familiar with Oceanian `grub,'\" said David. \"I take it that the drink is coroco?\"\n\"Yep. It's water percolated through the dried grounds of a common plant on Gardia, one of the better agri worlds in the quadrant. It's good stuff, though I recommend you limit yourself to a cup a day `til you get used to it. There's some trace chemicals in it that not only give it the flavour, but might make your bladder work overtime and keep you up all night if you're not careful.\"\n\"Sounds a bit like coffee,\" said David. John gave him a blank look. \"It's a drink from home that, from the description, could be fairly similar. These square things are called jaffles?\"\n\"That's right. Leftovers sandwiched between two slices of braco, then sealed and cooked.\"\n\"And braco...\"\n\"...is good stuff. My training is in naval command, not food production, I'm afraid, and describing everything that goes into good braco would be long and tedious, not to mention possibly inaccurate. Try one. You can always interrogate Theo if you get really curious about our cooking.\"\nDavid took a jaffle in his hand. It was warm and light brown, a palm sized square which bulged in the middle. He took a bite and chewed. There was a taste of processed grain and mildly spiced meat along with something he didn't recognize, a gooey yellow substance that fill the jaffle's interior. Steam wafted gently from the filling.\n\"This is SNACK food?\" asked David in disbelief.\n\"Yeah,\" replied John. \"If you want real Oceanian cooking, you'll have to visit sometime. I tried to convince Theo to serve us real food more often, but most of the crew rebelled, having taste buds cultivated elsewhere. Hence the meals to date.\"\nDavid took another bite, then sipped his coroco. It was slightly bitter, but with a subtle sweetness to it and a hint of something else that he couldn't quite place, though it was familiar.\n\"You're right, this is good. If the fare---sorry, `grub'---is as good as this regularly, I could be talked into moving very easily. There's something in the coroco that I can't quite make out, though...ethanol?\"\n\"Just enough to keep the toes warm. But none goes to the bridge. This is strictly an off-duty pot.\"\nJohn returned to eyeing the chess board, sipping from his cup while silently contemplating his next move. `So the good doctor is getting tricky. There must be some way to foil him, though...'\n\"Is all your crew Oceanian?\" asked David. \"The Maelstrom's crew seemed to be from all over the Union.\"\n\"No,\" replied John, \"but about half the crew is from my home sector. The Navy is divided on how to billet crews. Basically, there are two schools of thought---assignment by ship or by commanding officer. On the Nikaljuk, the two schools meet, or collide if you prefer. J`ali has worked on this ship for ten years and probably won't be assigned another command for at least a decade. He has a skeleton crew that stays with the ship at all times, mostly engineers whose greater experience with this ship gives them an edge. Then there's the crew that's assigned to me. Georgia, Theo, and Norman have all served on four different ships with me. There are a few others, some who've been with me longer, some shorter. Warwick was the latest addition, courtesy of Admiral Nick. Due to some regional political settlements with the Union, the Nikaljuk and its native crew are Turian, me and my crew are all Oceanian. So we get decent grub when we can, but we have to put up with J`ali's hot spices when the shipbound crew rebels.\"\n\"Ah, so he is the person to thank for last night's flaming curry?\"\n\"You got it! Vicious stuff, isn't it?\"\n\"Actually,\" said David, \"I rather liked it. I've never had Turian food before. I'll have to ask Theo how it's made.\"\n\"The primary ingredient is rocket fuel, I believe,\" said John.\n\"I'll admit it was rather hot. By the way, what does `Warwick's little gadget works' mean?\"\n\"The Nikaljuk either has a working stealth shield or a navigator who's in league with the engineers. Quiet now, please. I can't play two games at once.\"\nDavid sipped his coroco and smiled.\n\"No word from the Janella spacedock yet, sir,\" announced Suliman as Captain Huston relieved him at the con.\n\"How long have we been in hailing range?\"\n\"Seven hours. At our current rate, we should make planetary orbit in half an hour. A bit long for sleeping on the job.\"\n\"Have you been calling them the whole time?\"\n\"Just for the first quarter hour, then we got sick of it and just tried every twenty minutes or so.\"\n\"Hmm...Sounds like a general power failure. Can you get a visual of the station?\"\n\"Visual scan on maximum magnification,\" announced Norman Clarke, the Nikaljuk's pilot.\nThe forward screen showed the blue ball of a planet, complete with white streaks of water clouds. Orbiting high above it was a small splodge of shiny metal, reflecting the starlight of Janella's primary.\n\"I've not been able to find any emissions from the station whatsoever,\" continued Norman, monitoring his instruments as he spoke, \"including the normal radio noise from their power plant. Not even emergency band signals, which they should be using if there's been a blackout. I'm also not getting any infrared signature other than reflected starlight, though it would be hard to pick up their waste heat even from this distance.\"\n\"Anything on the threat board?\" asked Huston.\n\"Nope,\" replied Suliman. \"The nearest action is at Rosanna, over two hundred parsecs from here.\"\n\"Hmph. Have you been playing with the would-be stealth shield?\"\n\"No, sir. I had planned to call Janella, then flip it on and see if they could track us, but we haven't even got that far.\"\n\"Very well. You are relieved of the con.\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Suliman, saluting sharply before walking off the bridge.\n\"I have a target solution, Subahdar,\" announced Ordinance Officer Mikoyan aboard the Kalganian Raider Bristol. \"The ship has been hailing the spacedock without response or change of course. Passive scanners identify it as a lightweight military merchant craft.\"\n\"Military?\" asked Subahdar Argen. \"Are you sure it is alone?\"\n\"There are no other ships in detection range.\"\n\"Hold your fire,\" instructed the Subahdar.\n\"Captain, I have engine emission from high and right, approaching from our stern,\" announced Norman.\n\"Can you identify it?\" asked Captain Huston.\n\"Negative, Captain. I've never seen an engine plant signature like it.\"\n\"Display it, main screen.\"\nNorman threw the image onto the front viewscreen, erasing the picture of the approaching planet.\n\"Battle stations!\" snapped Huston. \"Pilot, dive for the planet, maximum acceleration. Navigator, calculate a hyperbolic orbit for optimum gravitational boost from Janella. We've picked up a raider...\"\n\"The merchant has detected us. It's diving for the planet, probably to get a gravitational assist,\" announced Mikoyan.\n\"Prepare to fire,\" commanded Subahdar Argen.\n\"Torpedo one is locked on target.\"\n\"Fire!\"\n\"Inbound torpedo,\" announced Norman.\n\"Slingshot ready?\" asked the Captain, slipping easily into the abbreviated speech necessary to handle the rapid pace of battle.\n\"Orbit computed, sir!\" answered Georgia from the navigation console.\n\"Execute!\"\n\"Done,\" replied Norman.\n\"Okay, folks,\" said the Captain as calmly as he could, \"this is what you've all been trained for. We've been shot at before and lived. Stay calm and we'll do it again. Our friend seems to be on his own. We can lose him yet...\"\n`Start taking your own advice,' he thought to himself. `Stay calm! They're only trying to kill you...'\n\"Engineer Jones!\" he ordered, the ship's computer automatically picking up the tone of voice and name to connect him with the engineer.\n\"Yes, sir?\" asked the grill next to his command chair.\n\"We've picked up unwanted company,\" explained the Captain, \"and I wouldn't mind disappearing. Is your stealth system up to the job?\"\n\"Sir,\" replied an obviously frightened Jones, \"it is only a partial shield, just as I told you. We will be much more difficult to detect at standard search frequencies, but not invisible. Off those search patterns, the stealth characteristics are much weaker. And any cloaking scramblers will be effective against us.\"\n\"Thank you, Senior Engineer Jones,\" said the Captain. \"If this works, I'll confirm your promotion with the Navy.\" He straightened from leaning towards the grill, signalling the computer to cut the comlink. \"Stand by, stealth. Lieutenant, compute an orbit change...\"\n\"The merchant has gone behind the planet,\" said Mikoyan. \"He'll be eclipsed for five minutes. I am continuing tracking via the torpedo's systems. It confirms the merchant is using the planet's gravity to boost him away from us. He will be in range for fifteen minutes after he re-emerges from the planet.\"\n\"How soon `til the current torpedo makes contact?\"\n\"Three minutes, Subahdar, but it will be eclipsed in thirty seconds.\"\n\"Set up a shot to intercept the Federalli ship when it comes around the planet, just in case the first torpedo does not finish it off.\"\nMikoyan bent over his instruments.\n\"Rough solution prepared. I can lock it in when the merchant comes out from behind the planet's disk. Ten seconds `til torpedo eclipse.\"\n\"The planet has eclipsed the raider's contact with its torpedo...now!\" announced Norman\n\"Release decoy and cloak, then execute course change,\" commanded Captain Huston.\n\"Decoy free and running,\" said Georgia.\n\"Stealth activated,\" announced Norman.\nOutside the Nikaljuk, the invisible energy shields that warded off meteoriods from the ship's hull underwent a subtle change.\n\"Course change initiated. The raider will be visible in two minutes,\" said Norman. \"The torpedo has acquired the decoy: Ninety seconds `til impact.\" Then he turned from the his console to face the Captain. \"That was close, sir.\"\n\"We'll be closer still soon. Stay calm, but remember: The decoy might have pulled the torpedo off us even without the stealth. Let's hope that little gadget really works...\"\n\"The merchant is overdue to emerge from eclipse,\" said Mikoyan. \"The torpedo must have destroyed it.\"\n\"Or the captain outmaneuvered it, then shifted to a lower orbit,\" countered Argen.\n\"Unlikely. That's a lot of fancy dodging for a freighter.\"\n\"Oh, very likely. You have never fought the Federallies before. Simpleton ship, maybe. But rarely a simpleton captain. I know them from battle. They are sneaky bastards with tricks you can only dream of. Bring us around the planet in a slow orbit and keep your finger near the trigger...\"\nThe Bristol's pilot began to move the ship around the shining blue globe of Janella.\n\"Further engine emission, sir,\" announced Georgia. \"He's headed for a high orbit.\"\n\"Firing solutions?\"\n\"Torpedoes one and two are locked.\"\n\"Fire both and set up a third.\"\n\"Firing...\"\n\"Inbound torpedoes!\" announced Mikoyan.\n\"What!\"\n\"Two torpedoes, coming straight at us. I can't see the merchant. He must have a cloaking device...\"\n\"A freighter? Impossible!\"\n\"The ship does not appear on any of our scanners and the torpedoes were not launched blindly from behind the planet.\"\n\"Evasive maneuvers! Fire!\"\n\"At what?\"\n\"Two inbound torpedoes,\" announced Georgia. \"They've fired back down our tracks.\"\n\"Running time?\"\n\"Thirty seconds,\" answered Norman. \"The Kalganians are jamming.\"\n\"New solution?\"\n\"It's very rough, but it would give him a nudge,\" replied Georgia.\n\"Hold your fire.\"\nFar behind the Bristol, a pair of silvery darts drove on through space, headed for the bright engine glow of the fleeing Kalganian. Inside their streamlined metal cases, instruments picked at the subtle signals of the jamming, trying to sort their true target from the dozens of shimmering ghosts thrown at them. At random intervals, each would shift frequency, momentarily clearing away the false images. Fooled for a moment, the first torpedo passed beneath the Bristol, harmlessly passing through the image it had perceived. Now, with the Bristol astern of it, the torpedo detected nothing and drove straight on, its undirected acceleration stopping only when its fuel supply was exhausted. Janella's primary had a new comet. In a hundred years, the metallic dart would fall in to the fiery star, adding in minuscule measure to the star's vast reserves of metallic gases.\nThe second torpedo was not fooled. It homed in on the exhaust of the fleeing Kalganian and ten metres short of the engine's vents, the warhead ignited. The entire torpedo was vapourized in an instant. The rear of the Bristol softened with the heat and flowed outward, driven by the internal pressure of the air within its hull. Further from the explosion, solid chunks came free and flew on random courses. The hull was punctured in at least a hundred places, completely overwhelming the safety systems. One flying piece ripped the side out of the Bristol's main generator. Shipboard power failed completely. The few not yet killed by the force of the explosion found themselves breathing vacuum instead of air. Backup power sealed sections from venting their atmosphere into space, but the punctures were so frequent that few of the bulkheads could hold long. Sections of the hull that had not been perforated were severely weakened. Under the continuing pressure of even the partial atmosphere remaining, they buckled and collapsed. In all the ship, only one section remained intact against the damage. And no crew were alive in that sealed tomb.\nThe Procurator touched the button on the trimensional recorder, deactivating it. Behind her, the sun had set and the night sky was visible. The dark was broken by myriads of shining stars.\n\"Gentlemen,\" she said, \"my pardon for making you speak so long without a break. Would you care for some refreshments?\"\nThe Doctor stood up from his chair and stretched.\n\"Yes, that would be nice. Iced water?\" Then he arced his back, groaning slightly as he did so. \"Old age is catching up with me. My body can't sit still for so long the way it used to.\"\n\"I feel a bit worn out myself,\" said Admiral Perry, \"though I bet it has more to do with it being dark outside than anything else. The clock might say it's midday, but my body still thinks dark means time to sleep.\"\nThe Procurator smiled. \"The price of having an office with a view on a planet where everything is underground. Museum's primary sets every twenty-seven and a quarter hours while planetary time goes full cycle in twenty-five. The last two days, I've just been finishing the day around sunrise.\"\n\"No time zones to worry about at least,\" said Dr. Drucker. \"After a few years here, it's strange to visit a more traditional planet where the time is set by the cycles of their primary.\"\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Museum is much more civilized that way. I can call someone on the other side of the planet in the morning and know I'm not interrupting their dinner. But I'm neglecting my job as host. A drink, Captain...sorry, Mr. Huston? Admiral Perry? A snack of some sort? Perhaps even one of those Oceanian delicacies...what did you call them? Jaffles?\"\n\"That's correct,\" replied John, \"though I've never heard them called a delicacy before. Some iced coroco would be nice.\"\n\"A tofaton for me, thanks,\" said Admiral Perry, \"if that's possible.\"\n\"Our bartender is familiar with Herculean drinks,\" replied the Procurator. \"I've yet to have a visitor ask for something it couldn't make. I think I will stick with local custom and have iced water. Pardon me a moment.\" With that, she moved to the door where she spoke with a guard.\n\"So that's how you did it,\" said Admiral Perry looking straight at John. \"I heard you pulled some sleight-of-hand trick, but no one told me the details.\"\n\"Come again?\" asked John. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\"Your trick with the meteoroid shields at Janella. Neat.\"\n\"Actually, it wasn't my trick---as I said, it was the creation of a junior engineer. It was him, not me, that saved our skins.\"\n\"He's not a junior engineer, you know,\" said Admiral Perry with a hint of slyness.\n\"Not anymore,\" replied John. \"I promoted him on the spot and the Navy confirmed it when we stopped at Maxel.\" Then he paused for a moment. \"You know, it's funny, but I don't think he'll be a senior engineer any longer than he was junior. I've never had so...well, so COMPETENT an engineer who wasn't master rated at least. I won't be surprised if Warwick is assigned to a cruiser in a few years. I wonder how he came to have such a junior rank?\"\n\"That's easy to explain,\" replied Admiral Perry smiling. \"I gave it to him. Regulations required that he either start from the bottom and earn his promotions from there, or go to officer school for three years before getting rank. He and I both agreed that school would be silly or even disastrous when he'd know more than any of his instructors, so he started from the bottom...as a junior engineer on the Nikaljuk.\n\"You see, Warwick Jones was a master engineer just a year ago. But civil, not military, and permanently groundside. But after having been on the job for a few years, he discovered he wanted to work on ships, and he came to the Navy. The local recruiter was sharp enough to see that Jones was an unusual candidate and immediately passed him on to me.\n\"But Admiral or no, I can't bend rules to suit me. I had an eager young man qualified in all but logtime to be chief engineer on a cruiser...but without the ship time, there's no way I could even have put him in charge of a pleasure yacht. And giving him junior rank and placing him on a big ship would be disastrous, both for himself in lack of satisfaction, and for his bosses who couldn't help but notice his superior ability. A lot of people feel threatened when they have to give orders to a more capable officer. You can imagine what might happen in a situation like that.\n\"The obvious solution was to find a small ship, one large enough to interest him, but small enough that there would only be a couple of other engineers who might potentially get aggravated. Besides, mismatches in rank and ability are a little more common on certain small ships, or so you seem to allege.\"\n\"Oh?\" said John in mock innocence.\n\"I recall you thinking yourself on par with me once upon a time,\" replied Admiral Perry jovially. \"But I haven't heard anyone call you `Admiral Huston' yet.\"\n\"Well, thank you,\" said John. \"For a moment there, I thought you were implying that I was incompetent and overranked.\"\n\"Maybe I was... But I digress. I knew I wanted a small ship, preferably with an Oceanian crew since Jones hails from there, and your name came up on the top of my list.\n\"In many ways, your crew was the most ideal. Jones would be joining you just at the same time you were changing to the Nikaljuk, so only the ship's permanent crew would be more experienced with the ship and they would not be surprised to find a highly capable engineer unfamiliar with the shipboard routine.\n\"The deciding factor, though, was how you work with your crew. I've heard what happens on your ship, playing games with each other like you do. Some of the officers who've served with you have mentioned it...or worse yet, tried the same thing on unprepared commanders elsewhere. I find it all most undignified and quite out of character with the code of conduct expected of a naval officer...\" and as he said this, Admiral Perry's voice grew stern, then suddenly softened, \"...but quite a lot of fun. You should have seen the look on Byron Parry's face when he discovered one of his senior engineer's had wired the Brach Y Pwull's bridge lights to start a strobe show every time someone used the officer's head! Our commanders could do with a few more safe surprises, and burning up the crew's energy on pranks improves discipline remarkably.\n\"So here I was with the perfect prank to pull on you, the original prankster himself. I told Jones to use his electrical wizardry on you whenever possible, then deliberately neglected to tell you anything about his background when he was assigned to you. And it all worked even better than I could have imagined. I warned Jones it might be quite a while before he got a promotion...and he came back from his first mission crowing victory in my face.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Huston. \"You managed to pull quite a joke on us all. Three quarters of my crew managed to get entangled in the attempt to find out if that gadget really was what Warwick claimed it was. J`ali thought it was the real thing while his chief engineer swore no such thing could be so small nor run on as little power as it did. And neither Warwick nor the device revealed a thing `til we stumbled on the Kalganian raider. He save our lives...and the chief engineer STILL insisted it had to be a fake.\"\n\"I wouldn't blame him,\" said Admiral Perry. \"While this is the first time I've ever been privy to what exactly happened, I've heard a few whispers in the halls of power...and they are just as mystified about how such a useful thing was never made or even thought of before. Jones seems to have a real genius.\n\"It's just sad that proving his device cost twenty crew their lives, even if they were Kalganian.\" And with that, Admiral Perry stood up wordlessly and stared out the window.\n\"Did you notice her ring?\" whispered Dr. Drucker leaning into John's ear.\n\"What ring?\" asked John, disoriented by the sudden change of conversation and Admiral Perry's reaction.\n\"The Procurator's,\" whispered Dr. Drucker in reply.\n\"It's a signet ring,\" answered John quietly, still looking at the melancholy Admiral. \"All upper rank civil servants have one. Why are we whispering?\"\n\"Look carefully at the design...\" but the archaeologist cut himself off as the Procurator returned.\n\"The drinks will be here in a moment,\" she said, then turned to the Admiral. \"Beautiful view, isn't it?\"\n\"Yes, it is,\" said the Admiral, startled out of his silent concentration. \"I always liked the night sky from Inner worlds. There are so many stars in the galactic plane. I grew up out on the Periphery where there are fewer nearby stars. Just the distant dusty white splodge of the galaxy.\"\nAs the Procurator talked with the Admiral, John caught a glimpse of her ring.\n`The design is familiar,' he thought, `but it shouldn't be. Before this business with the Nikaljuk, I've never even heard of the Procurator of Museum. Where have I seen that design before?'\nA soft bell tone sounded from the desk.\n\"Ah, our drinks are ready,\" said the Procurator. \"Bring them in!\"\nOne of the uniformed guards brought in the tray and placed it on the desk. He saluted sharply, then turned on his heel and left. Just as he did, John recalled where he had seen the signet design before...\n`How can the Procurator of Museum be wearing the seal of the Federal Commander in Chief unless...'\n\"That's the imprint of the Secretary-General!\" whispered John. \"The only person who can wear it is...\"\n\"Plotting something, you two?\" asked Admiral Perry. \"Come look at the view. Oceania can't boast a sky like this.\"\n\"True,\" said John, coming to the window. \"Oceania's in an intermediate sector. Enough stars to dazzle the visitors from the Periphery, but so much less so than the Inner worlds that the ambassadors consider our sky bland. What about your home, Dr. Drucker?\"\n\"My home is gone,\" Dr. Drucker replied flatly.\nJohn cursed himself inwardly for not remembering. The room was silent for several minutes while they drank and looked out the window. John wrinkled up his nose at the iced coroco. `Every time I ask for iced coroco offworld, they mess it up.' He had been handed a glass of refrigerated coroco with an ice cube floating in it. On any of the Oceanian worlds, it would have been served blended with frozen cream instead of with ice. `It's easy to forget they don't serve it properly elsewhere.'\n\"Well,\" said the Procurator finally, \"we should get back to business. But before we do, I have some trimens I want you to see.\" She turned to her desk and pulled out a set of prints from a drawer. She passed them to John.\n\"These were taken from...well, I'll let you guess.\"\nJohn looked at the first on the pile. It showed a silvery spacedock orbiting a blue planet with the characteristic white streaks of water vapour clouds. The spacedock seemed tiny there, dwarfed by the ball beneath it. Even from as far as the trimenograph had been taken, something did not look right. There appeared to be a gash in the outer hull and several of the protruding arms of the dock appeared snapped, others warped, and there might even have been some missing. John was not familiar enough with space engineering to tell, but from his experience of approaching docks, he knew roughly what they tended to look like. This was wrong. He handed the print to Dr. Drucker.\nThe next shot was taken much closer and showed the damage much more clearly. Smaller pock marks showed in the hull and the gash now appeared to have ripped through almost all of the hull. Plates of metal were twisted and distorted, bulging outwards where they had been softened by heat and yielded slightly to the pressure of an atmosphere behind them. Other sections of the hull had been heated so fiercely that the metal had vapourized, exposing the interior to the cold vacuum of space.\nThe next print showed the interior of the dock. There were bodies...\nJohn stopped looking. He knew what he would find. It was the space dock at Janella. The close up images looked similar to the brief shots the Nikaljuk had made before they had been ordered to Maxel. The Kalganians had gutted and destroyed the entire station, killing all the personnel. Intellectually, he had known that already. They could hardly have left a ship to ambush the Nikaljuk with an operational space dock in Federal hands at their back. But he had not thought further. The few brief images caught by the Nikaljuk were not taken close up and he had not examined them closely before handing them over to the commander at Maxel. He had not thought what that destruction would look like...\n\"How did you get these?\" asked Dr. Drucker. \"These pictures are from Janella. The Nikaljuk got attacked by the folks that did this and even we haven't seen these before.\"\n\"You've both admired my ring,\" replied the Procurator with a slight smile, \"so you know my position. I have access to such things.\" She leaned forward and took the prints from Admiral Perry as he finished with them.\n\"But you are wrong,\" she continued. \"These images are not from Janella. They were presented to me by the ambassador of Turnay after his release. This is what the Federal Navy did to the space station at Turnay two weeks later. However, the pictures taken by the Haiphong at Janella are remarkably similar. It seems the tactics of evil Kalganians differ little from our own...I can show you the images from Janella too if you wish.\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said John with a hint of firmness in his voice that conveyed certainty.\n\"Why are you showing us this?\" asked Admiral Perry.\n\"I will come to that in the end,\" replied the Secretary-General.\n\"If you're the Secretary-General...\" began Dr. Drucker, \"who has been the Procurator of Museum for the last five years? I mean, this is the first time I've ever had even a hint that you weren't in command here. And what are you doing here? What's this inquiry really about?\"\n\"I have been the Secretary-General of the Federal Galactic Union for ten years, ever since my father passed the title on to me. I've also been the Procurator of Museum for the last five of those years.\n\"I had always dreamed of having a job like this, but never thought that holding the federal scepter would ever let me. Then there was the assassination attempt by the Kalganian Intelligence Service. It was not the first, but it came within an ace of succeeding and no other threat to my person had ever been so serious. I went into hiding, eventually coming to Museum when the previous procurator resigned.\n\"It has been the perfect disguise. My first years of office were anonymous enough that I have not been recognized save by those I wished and as Procurator of Museum, seeing my face in any corner of the galaxy is perfectly in place. Whenever and wherever I am needed in my role as Secretary-General, there is sure to be a nearby historian, anthropologist, or archaeologist to justify my official appearance. The government on Throne is a mock structure to draw the fire of the assassins and quell the doubts of all but the most inquisitive.\"\n\"But you've just revealed yourself to us!\" said Dr. Drucker. \"Why? And why does our expedition to First World merit your attention?\"\n\"The most important reason in the Galaxy, Doctor. But let me deal with that when we finish this recording...\" and so saying, she restarted the recorder on the table.\nJesse Allen is an overworked, underloved graduate student at the Universityof Iowa.

Though small by Federal standards, the city in the sky regularly housed ten thousand. Unlike its cousins orbiting inhabited planets, Maxel circled no primary. It merely hung in space, the nearest star over three parsecs away. With no populous planets nearby, it was not a commercial stopover. No profit-minded interest had ever been shown in the station. But the war had demanded that there be piers where ships could rest without the normal long haul on ion drive necessary near stars. Once a short distance away, ships departing Maxel simply kicked straight into hyperdrive. A day out of port, they could be a full parsec away, fully ten thousand times the distance covered in the same time on ion drive. Without the lengthy climb out of a stellar gravitational well, and clear of the denser interplanetary medium, ships trimmed days, even weeks, off their voyage time.\nThe Nikaljuk was docked at one of the outermost service corridors, a long flexible tube extending out to the one exit hatch in use. The freighter looked out of place among the sleek war ships of the Federal Navy, their shining steel hulls bristling with the weapons of their trade. Dr. Drucker and Captain Huston looked out on the scene from a large window overlooking the quay. Behind them, a number of officers milled about, two concentrating on a game board projected on the table in front of them.\nSuddenly, the stars dimmed as the window darkened. A few kilometres out from the station, a ship cut in its hyperdrive, the bright light of its engine thrust drowning out everything in its dazzling brilliance. But the window had adjusted its filtering appropriately: The bright exhaust tubes could be watched without blinking. The ship pulled away, rapidly picking up speed as it dwindled away into the distance. As it streaked off into the night sky, the stars gradually reappeared as the window returned to its usual transparency.\n\"John Huston!\" called out one of the game players, suddenly looking up from the holographic playing cube in front of him. \"What an unexpected pleasure! What brings you to this corner of the Union?\"\nCaptain Huston and Dr. Drucker turned from the window to face the speaker. He was a tall, thin man in his middle thirties with short blonde hair, dressed in the dark, close fitting uniform of a navy officer.\n\"Byron Parry!\" exclaimed Captain Huston, moving over to shake hands with the player. \"Good to see you again. Dr. Drucker, this is Byron Parry from the Brach Y Pwull, a friend of mine from academy days. Byron, Dr. Drucker, chief archaeologist of Museum.\"\nCaptain Huston looked at Byron's neckline for a moment, noting the four silver clusters on the neckline.\n\"Not a Captain any more? Congratulations!\" he remarked.\n\"Thanks,\" replied Byron. \"I got the promotion to Commander three months ago. And these days, I'm on the Rodina. Dr. Drucker, glad to meet you. I recall your name from the ruckus back when the historians were stirring up Parliament to fund Museum.\"\n\"My involvement with those affairs was slight,\" replied Dr. Drucker modestly. \"Politics is not my field, though I do think Parliament did make the right decision in the end.\"\n\"Indeed,\" said Byron. \"I've been meaning to visit the place for some time. My kids have been twice already with school and have come home screaming with pleasure and running circles around me in History both times. How about you, John? What have you been up to?\"\n\"I'm still a mere captain,\" replied John, \"but I have managed to get off the escort roster. I'm working on the Nikaljuk, a light freighter, assisting Dr. Drucker and his team on a research project. A strange occupation for a Navy captain in the middle of a war, but orders are orders.\"\n\"Since you're not going to introduce me,\" said the player across the board, \"it IS your turn.\" She spoke with a thick accent that Captain Huston did not recognize, swallowing all her vowels.\n\"John, Dr. Drucker, this is Siabohn O`Neil,\" Byron said, \"Captain of the Brach Y Pwull. She was my second.\"\n\"Five years on the Brach Y Pwull,\" said Siabohn, \"and he STILL can't pronounce it properly. At least with me in command, the crew has a captain who can talk properly.\"\n\"Perhaps if you Orionians spoke using the same vowels as the rest of the galaxy,\" retorted Byron merrily, \"you wouldn't have such troubles.\" Then he waved his hand at the game board. \"What do you think of this, John?\"\nCaptain Huston knelt down to look at the board carefully, examining the formation of red and black pieces strewn throughout the cube's volume.\n\"It looks like you've been out matched, but there are some possibilities here,\" said John after a few moments.\n\"You're in trouble,\" Dr. Drucker warned Captain O`Neil, \"if you let John join the fray. They used to call him `the Dark Master' for the way he plays this game.\"\nAt that, Huston suddenly looked up at Dr. Drucker who was now examining the playing board from O`Neil's side of the cube.\n\"Who told you that?\" he asked.\n\"Admiral Perry,\" replied Dr. Drucker nonchalantly. \"Did you honestly think I challenged you blindly?\"\n\"After those first two games,\" replied Captain Huston, \"yes. You knew the whole time? Did you just let me win those two?\"\n\"I wish I could say yes,\" replied Dr. Drucker sheepishly, \"but I'm afraid that, even forewarned, your style managed to take me by surprise. But you've lost that edge now.\"\n`Indeed I have,' thought Huston. `This last game has been dragging on for a week now. He just started massacring my pieces all of a sudden. I've struck back and devastated him too, but neither of us is winning, more than a hundred moves since the last capture.'\n\"By the way,\" started Huston, \"what's all the excitement about? We've seen four ships kick off in the last hour.\" Right on cue, the window darkened again as another ship cut its hyperdrive in.\n\"How long have you been here?\" asked Parry.\n\"Just a couple of hours,\" answered Huston. \"What have I been missing?\"\n\"You missed it, all right,\" said O`Neil.\n\"The Haiphong, mate,\" added Parry. \"Admiral Nguyen himself was here not a week ago, then suddenly scrambled out of here yesterday afternoon. Apparently the Kalganians have started a new offensive. They razed a few planets only a dozen parsecs from here. Clobbered the orbital stations, bombarded the ground-space facilities, then left a few snipers to harass anyone who came to aid the locals too soon.\"\n\"And they sent the Haiphong? Kind of overkill, isn't it?\"\n\"It seems there was some high level concern. A bunch of civilians were headed for one of the nearby systems that lost contact a few days ago. The Secretary-General had some personal interest in the passengers and wanted the Navy to intercept them before they tried to make planet fall. But that was only the first stop: Haiphong is heading for Sagittarius to handle the new troubles there.\"\nCaptain Huston and Dr. Drucker exchanged a shocked look.\n\"This ship...\" asked Dr. Drucker. \"It wouldn't happen to have been headed for Janella, by chance?\"\nCommander Parry's head snapped up from the game cube.\n\"That's classified information!\" he said sternly. \"How did you get a hold of it?\"\n\"Good grief!\" exclaimed Captain Huston. \"That was us! We got jumped by a raider at Janella three days ago and barely got out alive. We were about to survey the area and see what was going on when we got ordered to get here full blast. But the Secretary-General? All I'm doing is shuttling around some prehistory specialists!\"\n\"It seem you've become a VIP,\" said Commander Parry with respect.\n\"You said Nguyen was taking the Haiphong to Sagittarius,\" said Dr. Drucker. \"What's happening?\"\n\"Hmm,\" rumbled Commander Parry hesitating. \"Well, I doubt the censors will quash this. The razing rampage has only been a small part of a general renewed offensive by the Empire. Sagittarius has born the brunt of it. They've been dropping nova bombs into every star with a ship yard nearby without much regard to inhabited planets.\"\n\"Nova bomb?\" asked Dr. Drucker, his face turning white. \"What's that?\"\n\"It's a device dropped into a star. It penetrates deep into the stellar core, then explodes. The detonation, when placed correctly, disrupts the balance of the fusion reactions that power the star.\n\"Of course, stirring up something which has a mass of 10$^{30}$ kilograms is quite a task, so the change is quite short lived and doesn't disrupt the entire star. But it's enough --- for at least a few hours, the bomb wreaks total chaos. The high energy particle flux from the star jumps by several orders of magnitude, well beyond the maximum tolerance of even the best shipboard shielding. Anything caught in space within a milliparsec is cooked through and through. Space stations too: Even they can't withstand that kind of blast. If they're on the far side of a planet when it starts, the planet will shield them... until their orbit takes them over to dayside. And most stations are in low orbits with periods around a hundred minutes, far too short to save them.\"\n\"And the planet?\" asked Dr. Drucker with concern.\n\"Dayside, they'll all get baked... and they're the lucky ones. The particles turn the atmosphere into a hodgepodge of radioactive isotopes. A lot of air is simply ionized and then neutralizes itself violently. But the altered isotopes... Anyone who survives the initial blast will die from radiation sickness. Nightsiders can be evacuated, but their ships have to remain in the planet's shadow until the particle storm is over, which involves defying about a half dozen laws of orbital mechanics. Not that it can't be done, but that can save only a few thousand at best. For everyone else, there's simply nothing that can be done. They'll die. All of them.\"\n\"But rescue missions? Surely they can treat the sick?\" said Dr. Drucker pathetically.\n\"This is radiation sickness, not a fever,\" replied Byron. \"Once you get it, the best anyone can do is make you comfortable. And how do you rescue a hundred million people? Half of them won't live long enough for a rescue mission to even make it there. For very mild cases, the tissue damage can be undone or removed, but past that exposure level, there's nothing that can be done. A few very lucky people who hid in shelters might escape enough of the radiation and altered atmosphere to have treatable exposure levels. But again, that's going to be thousands at the most.\"\n\"So no one can live through a nova bomb?\" said Dr. Drucker quietly.\n\"That's about the size of it,\" replied Byron.\nDr. Drucker turned to Captain Huston.\n\"My family...they're on Hardin, near the center of the Sagittarius sector. And there's three ship construction yards there, two of them working for the Navy.\"\n\"Hardin?\" said Siabohn comfortingly. \"I've not heard of any action reaching that deep into the sector yet. You can check with the base commander: He can get you in touch with your family if it's possible and he'll know if the action is close. The Haiphong and its escort fleet is setting up blockades around inhabited planets. If Hardin hasn't been attacked yet, the fleet will be protecting it. And the Kalganians will find it hard to run through the Haiphong's screens. Nguyen's the sort you hate to have as an enemy.\"\nBut Dr. Drucker missed the last of her words. He was already out the door headed for the base commander's office.\nLieutenant Judith Swerth noticed she was chewing her nails and forced her hand out of her mouth. It was the fifth time she had caught herself gnawing at her fingers in the last ten minutes and the condition of her nails suggested she had done it many more times than that. It was a nervous habit of teenage years that returned under stress.\nShe had been in the command chair of the Wangratta for the past five hours and was due to change watch in another three. She was one of eight officers from the Chepachet, a federal cruiser assigned to monitor the Hardin star system. Although the entire sector was theoretically protected by blockade ships, the Navy was taking no risks and had assigned additional ships to protect individual star systems within the blockade volume. The Wangratta was a small scout ship specifically designed to monitor shipping traffic while remaining undetected herself. Her crew were all junior officers training for command positions --- they rotated turns at each of the pilot, monitor, engineer and command positions.\nWhen the unexplained signal came in from the neutrino strips lining the Wangratta's hull, Swerth had been excited and pleased she had the command. It was the third such contact and thus was dubbed Gondor 3, the Navy parlance for a suspected, but unidentified enemy ship. The other two had occurred while she was off duty or at the navigator's console. While she was certainly involved, there had not been a chance to prove herself from the command chair. But now her enthusiasm had given way to worry and tension. Gondor 3 had initially appeared as a middle weight Kalganian raider nearby, approaching at a speed that would bring it close to the Wangratta in a matter of hours. The Wangratta would grapple with the raider, locking on tractor beams to anchor it in space. Her powerful engine plant could generate power enough to maintain her protective shields against the very worst barrage the raider could bring to bear. Meanwhile, the Chepachet would come into position and destroy the enemy ship.\nBut the encounter had not happened. Despite Gondor 3's velocity, clearly discernible from the Doppler shift in its energy pattern, it had not yet arrived. That implied it was at a greater distance and its neutrino signal came from a larger power plant than she had assumed. Each passing moment made the smallest size ship still explainable by the signal larger and larger. In another ten minutes, she would be sure beyond all doubt that the inbound ship was beyond the Wangratta's defensive shield capacity...and perhaps would even out gun the Chepachet. Yet how could something that large have escaped the outer guards?\nThere was a possible answer. The neutrino strips were very new and few ships were equipped with them. Neutrinos are highly penetrating particles generated in a host of nuclear reactions. The collapse of a supernova, the deep cauldron of a stellar core, and the power plants of starships all produced the tiny, massless particles in profusion. They were so penetrating that they could escape from the depths of a star and it was hopeless to even attempt to contain them in a fusion vessel. But just as they could pass through a reactor wall, they also passed through detectors without appreciable effect. Neutrino detectors were normally giant devices where a single detection implied the presence of trillions of non-detections.\nThe Wangratta's detectors, however, were subtly different. A modification of the detector material during its forging yielded a material which, when an appropriate energy field was applied, had a billion-fold greater cross-section to passing neutrinos. Detections remained marginal and little information could be eeked from what signal there were. But it made for a passive tracking system. A ship which shut down its own power plant could lie undetected and yet monitor all traffic within a considerable volume of space around it. And until a way was found to contain neutrinos, there was no countermeasure to thwart it.\nWhat Lieutenant Swerth feared, however, was the countermeasures for the usual scanners which were quite feasible, such as might have been used to slip past the blockade. A ship with a large enough power plant could hold up just such a device, fooling a searching ship into seeing nothing. Those countermeasures, in turn, could be scrambled, but again, power limitations made it possible for only the largest starships to carry the scramblers. Could it be that a large Kalganian ship could have evaded the scrambling fields and with its stealth system, passed unnoticed by the outer guard ships?\nBut that was impossible! Almost all of the Sagittarius sector was surrounded by heavy ships set in positions such that their scrambling fields would have a 25% overlap. There would be no way to penetrate that shield undetected.\nYet there was definitely something approaching which should not have been and it must have escaped the attention of the outer guards.\n\"I have signal resolution,\" announced Lieutenant Helgth. \"Gondor 3 is no longer a single point source.\"\n`Good,' thought Swerth. `That mean's it's close enough for secondary power sources to be detected, making it quite close. Probably a heavier rated raider instead of the middle weight I had assumed. The Wangratta can still handle that.' Swerth's assumptions rested on knowing the volume of space the neutrino strips could comb, the flux and velocity of the approaching vessel, and its probable distance at the time of first contact. There was also the matter of the spectral signatures --- different class vessels gave off subtly different energy patterns and Gondor 3 had many of the spectral signatures of medium displacement raider. But recognizing neutrino signatures was a new and uncertain business and it was quite feasible for the raider to have been somewhat larger than the energy spread of its power plant initially appeared.\n\"Gondor 3 now appears as three contacts,\" continued Helgth. \"Assessment shows central contact is a Kalganian cruiser with two accompanying heavy raiders. From an extreme distance, their combined signature appears like that of a medium raider.\"\n`Bad,' thought Swerth, her sudden hopes dashed. `Very, very bad.'\n\"Notify the Chepachet,\" she commanded.\n\"There is some ambiguity in the identification of Gondor 3,\" explained Helgth from the signal processor. Then he swiveled in his chair.\n\"There could be even more ships,\" he said in a dead pan voice.\nSiabohn and Byron sat across the table from each other starting down each other's pieces. John Huston sat beside Byron looking at the board, but with an unattentive eye. Occasionally, he would glance at the empty seats next to himself or at the chess pieces arrayed across the table just as they had been put there by himself and David Drucker a week ago. They had been halfway through setting up the board when the Navy reported the vapourization of the Chepachet and the subsequent bombardment of Hardin's primary. Dr. Drucker had left then and not returned. No one had seen him since, though everyone knew where he was.\nJohn looked at the chess board one more time and had to fight back the instinct to rise and go to the archaeologist's quarters. But John had sat in the command chair long enough to know some griefs were meant to be private. When Dr. Drucker truly wanted to talk, he would come of his own accord.\n\"Long range scanners confirm the planet is inhabitable, Captain,\" announced Georgia. \"It has a nearly circular orbit almost exactly in the middle of the life compatible range. Atmosphere analysis shows that the air is predominantly nitrogen with an approximate 20% oxygen content. Carbon dioxide levels are low and within biocompatible limits. This could be it, sir.\" She couldn't keep a hint of excitement out of her voice.\n\"It does sound good,\" replied Captain Huston, \"and we can tell more from here than early settlers. Now we have to hope for something a little bad --- we're looking for an abandoned planet, so there has to be something to have driven the settlers away after they got here. Something subtle enough to have been missed in a preliminary analysis, but annoying enough to have convinced them to leave later.\"\n\"I'll keep looking,\" said Georgia, obviously pleased.\nThe Nikaljuk was slowly spirally in toward the second of the water\/oxygen worlds circling G-type stars within the region the probe was supposed to have come from. The archaeologists that had been bound for Janella and Srosa had left them at Maxel. Instead of being flown to those destinations by the Nikaljuk as had been originally planned, they were going with the second wave of military convoys, the first having re-established order. Those who remained with the Nikaljuk began the search for the abandoned planets which might, in the ancient settler's ruins, give Dr. Drucker's team another of the missing clues to the elusive First World.\nSo far, the search has not gone well. The stellography mission to this part of the sector was ancient and outdated. The information was skimpier than it had seemed at first glance. Just a simple note of star mass, luminosity, and stellar class, plus the presence of planets and their orbital parameters. Few of the planets had been accurately classified, let alone examined in detail. The Nikaljuk's first stop at one of the F type stars had been typical: The planet reported in an acceptable orbit for life tolerable conditions had proven to be an airless ball with a distinctly elliptical orbit. At periastron, the planet was too close to its primary for livable temperatures while apastron grazed the outer limit. But it had been a long shot to start with since G, not F, type stars were the norm for habitable planets.\nThey were still optimistic when they arrived at their next stop, one of the two G type stars in the region which was known to have a planet in the right range of orbits. But that too had proven a disappointment. The stellographers classification of water\/oxygen world had not been mistaken, but they had missed one vital detail. There was carbon dioxide in the atmosphere along with the normal gases, and it was present in poisonously high levels. The heavy concentration of the gas trapped infrared emission from the surface, bringing the planet's surface temperature up to hundreds of degrees. Colonists would have been desperate to try living in such a place, though with air conditioned homes and refrigerated greenhouses, they could have survived. But that chance seemed remote enough that Dr. Drucker had not hesitated to move on.\nTheir third destination, orbiting a F type star, was again a long shot. But they did not waste any time getting close to eliminate it as a possibility. Even as they entered the edges of the planetary system, scanners revealed the candidate planet's atmosphere was transparent to ultraviolet light. Even around a G type star, such a planet would be uninhabitable.\nEnthusiasm was growing again as they approached their fourth destination. This, too, orbited a G type star and was known to have a planet within the tolerable orbital limits and classified water\/oxygen by the surveyors. Long range scanners confirmed the presence of the usual radiation trapping zones from a magnetic field, the atmosphere was distinctly opaque to all but the longest ultraviolet wavelengths, and the traces of carbon dioxide were normal. Temperatures plummeted near the planet's poles, but were downright balmy across the equator. All in all, everything looked like an ideal planet for settlers to try their hand at. Certainly they must have at least approached this planet.\nSoon, the Nikaljuk would go into a low polar orbit and make a detailed map of the planet's surface, assisted by a pair of automated probes that had been outfitted on the ship's hull at Museum. If they found anything that looked like it might have been an ancient landing site or settlement, the drones could make low flying passes for closer investigation. If it seemed warranted, the Nikaljuk could attempt to find a landing site and set down, though the energy involved in climbing back out of the planet's atmosphere and gravitation well was considerable.\n`This is the most interesting project I've done since joining the Navy,' thought Captain Huston. `Even better than coming to grips with those Kalganian monsters...' and as he thought that, he gripped his command chair harder. `Monsters, all right. I will make them pay someday.' The enthusiasm that everyone else had shown for the exploration and particularly the prospect of this approaching planet had not been shared by Dr. Drucker. He had been very subdued since they left Maxel.\nJohn thought about Hardin's destruction. That the Kalganian cruiser's crew were killed by the same blast that claimed Dr. Drucker's family and over five hundred million other lives seemed poor compensation. `We ought to drop a nova bomb into Kalgania's sun and see what they think of it then!}' But beneath his anger, Captain Huston realized that it had been tried and failed several times, and even that would not prove anything even if it did succeed. Destroying the imperial capital would no more halt the Kalganian Empire than if the Union lost Throne. Between the Kalgan sector and all its allies, the Imperium commanded thousands of worlds and destroying every inhabited planet in their power would take more nova bombs than there were in the Union's arsenal.\n\"I've completed the detailed spectral analysis, sir,\" announced Georgia. \"The planet's primary is G2 with the normal metallic content and a mass of three times ten to the thirtieth kilograms. It is presently in an active period, with a number of flares and prominences, but nothing unusual for its class. Barring some unusual activity cycle that my instruments couldn't predict from these readings, this is a completely normal star for a habitable planet's primary.\"\n\"Can you assess the probability of unusual solar activity sufficient to make the planet unpleasant?\" inquired Captain Huston.\n\"I can assess it,\" answer Georgia, \"and it is bloody unlikely! This class is the best studied of all stars; after all, 95% of the galactic population lives within a stone's throw of G type stars. Chances are less than one in a million that solar activity from this star could make things more than mildly uncomfortable on the planet. I don't think we'll find anything to drive away colonists from the star. Whatever it was must have been from the planet itself.\"\n\"We'd better find something wrong with this place soon,\" said Captain Huston. \"It would be quite a shock to find that no one in the last ten thousand years has bothered to notice a perfectly inhabitable planet in the middle of the oldest sector. How long `til we establish orbit?\"\n\"Three hours, sir,\" answered Norman from the pilot's console. \"It will take another half hour of maneuvering to get into the polar mapping orbit from our initial approach orbit.\"\n\"Release the drones as soon as we establish polar orbit,\" ordered Captain Huston.\n\"You BEAUTY!\" exclaimed Georgia.\n\"Lieutenant, you are on the bridge,\" reprimanded Captain Huston.\n\"Sorry, Captain,\" apologized Georgia. \"I think I've found what we're looking for.\"\n\"We've established a stable polar orbit,\" announced Norman. There was a twin pair of gentle thuds from the ship's rear. \"Both drones released. They should drop to their cruising altitude in half an hour.\"\n\"Dr. Drucker to the bridge, please,\" said Captain Huston to the computer grill. \"Lieutenant Smythe?\"\n\"Radioactivity,\" she said proudly. \"There's slight traces of radioactive isotopes spread over the planet. Nothing serious --- you'd get only a little less exposure on the surface from the planet's primary. It's unusual, though.\"\n\"Native radioactivity?\" said Captain Huston. \"I've never heard of it being significant enough to be mentioned in a general planetary assessment.\"\n\"As I said,\" replied Georgia, \"it's unusual. Radioactivity comes from the heavier elements which normally would not be found on the surface of a planet. During formation, they tend to gravitate towards the inner core of the planet and deposits are very sparse nearer the surface.\n\"But that's not all that's unusual about this planet. There's that satellite we noted on the way in. It's four hundred thousand kilometres out, but it's almost a full percent of the planet's mass, much more than is common for terrestrial planets. Even from its distant orbit, the satellite exerts sufficient gravitation to alter the surface. We've observed tidal changes in the level of the oceans on the order of metres in places.\"\n\"And that would have been sufficient to disturb the differentiation of the planet during its formation and bring heavier elements to the surface?\"\n\"It's just a piece of dead reckoning so far,\" confessed Georgia. \"I got the readings and tried to come up with a hypothesis for it. The computer is running a simulation right now to see if my explanation holds water. But wherever those heavier elements came from, extrapolating the current levels backwards nine thousand years and this starts to become a decidedly uncomfortable place to make home. Not unmanageable, but enough to cause somewhat higher rates of degenerative diseases, birth defects, and a few other nasty side effects. Perhaps tolerable when the pickings were slim, but as soon as colonists found better places, they would have moved on.\"\n\"You called for me?\" asked Dr. Drucker as he walked onto the bridge.\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Huston. \"We've just released the surveying drones and established our mapping orbit.\"\n\"So this is definitely an inhabitable planet? I've been a little tired lately and have been snoozing instead of following the reports as they come in.\"\n\"Indeed it is, barring one detail. The crust is mildly radioactive. It's marginal now, but Lieutenant Smythe claims it would have been at irritating levels nine thousand years ago. The place is good enough to have attracted early colonists, but still unpleasant enough to send them on their way as soon as better prospects offered themselves.\"\n\"Radioactivity, you say,\" said Dr. Drucker.\n\"It is a little unusual,\" said Georgia. \"I guessed it could have come from an enhanced quantity of heavy elements in the planetary crust.\"\n\"Unusual?\" said Dr. Drucker, quickly becoming excited. \"It's more than unusual! I've never heard of anything like it before! How did you arrive at your figures for the radioactivity levels? Do you have a detailed analysis of the elementary composition?\"\n\"No,\" answered Georgia. \"I couldn't identify the elements from our orbit. The atmosphere blurs the energy of the decay photons. So I made a surmise and threw it back through each of the four standard decay chains.\"\n\"Mind if I look at your calculations?\" asked Dr. Drucker. \"I work with radioactive dating techniques regularly and know a little bit about the subject. What are the end products of each of your extrapolated chains...\" and the conversation continued, delving into technical language which Captain Huston could not fathom. But it was obvious that Dr. Drucker and Lieutenant Smythe would be untangling the question of the planet's geological history for some time.\n`There's really nothing I can do with this,' thought Captain Huston looking at the chess board on the table in the middle of his room. `Neither of us, barring a mistake by the other, can win.' It had been thirty moves now since Dr. Drucker had tried to draw Captain Huston's rook and knight into an attack on the archaeologist's bishop which was closing in to hound the black king. But Captain Huston had seen through the subterfuge soon enough, noticing that Dr. Drucker's true aim was not the king, but to sneak his one remaining pawn through to be queened. `And if I had not seen that soon enough, the game would have been over in a matter of moves. I can hold his bishop and knight, but never quite threaten his king, just as he can threaten my pieces, but not take them without disastrous loss himself. What was the special name for this stage of the game? Stalemate? But I am not prepared to give up quite yet. Just one little slip...'\n\"Captain Huston, please report to the bridge,\" said Captain Suliman's voice from the comlink grill next to the door.\nCaptain Huston looked at the chess board one more time before striding out to the bridge. `Oh, dear,' he though as he saluted Captain Suliman. `Everyone is looking rather glum.'\n\"You got here promptly,\" said Captain Suliman. \"I thought you would be sleeping. Otherwise I would have called you earlier.\"\n\"I was trying to thwart Dr. Drucker's chess strategies,\" replied Captain Huston. \"Is there a problem?\"\n\"I think Lieutenant Smythe and Dr. Drucker can explain better than I,\" said Captain Suliman.\nCaptain Huston turned to face the two. The rest of Captain Huston's bridge crew had left when relieved by Captain Suliman and his officers, but Georgia apparently had remained with the archaeologist, arguing over her calculations. Obviously, that had continued for several more hours.\n\"Captain,\" began Georgia, \"this is not the abandoned planet we were hoping to find.\"\n\"So we head for the remaining F star? You realize we'll be flat out of luck if that planet wasn't settled. We don't have any clues where that probe came from if we can't find an abandoned settlement.\"\n\"There's no need to move on,\" she said. \"This is First World.\"\n`This is it?' thought Captain Huston with a sudden surge of excitement, one that died when we saw her expression. `There's nobody down there...and why is everyone looking so down? Something is missing here...'\n\"The drones found clusters of mineral deposits that were definitely not accidental,\" continued Georgia. \"What their purpose might have been, we can only guess. Probably surface habitation. Ten thousand years of weathering would have destroyed their original form. But the chemical collections are definitely artificial. No natural force could have gathered materials together in that fashion. And there are thousands of these clusters, some of them hundreds of square kilometres in size. It would take millions of people hundreds of years to construct whatever those heaps once were.\n\"That's how we eliminated the possibility of this being an abandoned planet. If it was good enough to support a few hundred million, or even a few billion, why abandon it? And how could they evacuate that many? Even now, with the resources of the entire Federation, that would be quite a feat.\"\n\"So there were once a few million people living here...and they weren't evacuated and they aren't here now. So where are they?\"\n\"If you extrapolate the current radiation levels,\" said Dr. Drucker, \"back to the time of the probe's launch instead of just nine thousand years, the radiation is not only irritating, but lethal. Anyone caught on the surface at that time would die.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" said the thoroughly confused Captain Huston. \"First, you say this is First World, then that the planet had a lethal crust. If you extrapolate the radioactivity back a few thousand years more, you'd have enough heat to melt the crust and that is patent nonsense! What gives?\"\n\"The extrapolation combined with information from the drone probes shows that the radioactivity comes from a number of different elements. Principally barium and thorium, but there's quite a mishmash.\"\n\"Barium?\" said Captain Huston. \"The gravitational differentiation model predicted this?\"\n\"No, Captain,\" said Lieutenant Smythe. \"My suggestion proved to be just a shot in the dark. The simulation did not predict particularly unusual radioactivity levels. However, it did suggest the planet would have higher concentrations of heavy metals in the crust, including uranium in mineable deposits.\"\n\"And the balance of radioactive elements matches the end products of a widespread fissioning of uranium 238 near the time of the probe's launch,\" said Dr. Drucker quietly. \"Perhaps thirty years later, though the date are somewhat imprecise.\"\n\"But U$^{238}$ is stable!\" exclaimed Captain Huston. \"I'm not a radio chemist, but even I know that!\"\n\"Indeed it is,\" said Dr. Drucker, \"and that's the most alarming part of all. For U$^{238}$ to fission, it must be exposed to an intense flux of fast neutrons. Judging from the evidence of glassified rock at a number of spots where concentrations of the elements are higher, I'd suggest a hydrogen fusion device was used to produce the neutrons in sufficient number to spark the chain reaction.\"\n\"But why?\" said Captain Huston. \"It doesn't make any sense. Why go around shattering perfectly stable uranium nuclei when all the end products are deadly?\"\n\"Exactly,\" said Dr. Drucker. \"They are deadly...and that is the point. Do you have any idea how much energy a few kilograms of U$^{238}$ gives off when it fissions?\"\n\"A lot, but...\"\n\"A lot?\" snapped Dr. Drucker. \"The ignition system alone could flatten a spaceport! The fission would double or even quadruple the power of such a device. Entire cities could be laid waste by one of those! A few hundred of them and an entire planet would die...and that's just what happened!\"\n\"Oh, come off it,\" said Captain Huston light heartedly, trying to disarm the archaeologist's seriousness. \"You can't build something like that without understanding what it would do if it was used like you just suggested. Sheer common sense would prevent them from using it...and therefore from even building it in the first place. You can't really believe that!\"\n\"Really!\" exploded Dr. Drucker. \"A race committed genocide here, Captain! But those weapons are puny compared to those in deployment now. They used hundreds of them and it still would have taken years to kill their planet. Hardin was devastated in minutes from a single bomb! Where's the `sheer common sense' in that?\" and with that, the chief archaeologist stomped off the bridge, leaving the entire crew thunderstruck.\nOutside, the ruddy ball of Museum's sun was starting to peek over the horizon. The room was silent. Neither the Secretary-General nor Admiral Perry made a move to switch off the trimensional recorder.\n\"Do you understand now why I have called you here for this report?\" asked the Procurator softly after the silence had lasted for several minutes.\n\"No, sir,\" replied John.\n\"It has been twenty years now since the border skirmish that started this war,\" began the Secretary-General, rising from her seat to stand at the window and watch the dawn. \"Since my father sent the fleets to Kalgan all those years ago, over a hundred billion lives have been lost. Many of them soldiers, but mostly civilians. Their crime was merely to have lived on planets with orbiting ship yards of the wrong colour.\n\"And there's no sign of the carnage stopping. Oh, the Federal Union will win eventually. Of that, there can be no doubt. We have almost twice their resources. But at what cost? It could be twenty years before it ends, or even more. It has cost too much already.\n\"My father never could have envisaged what he started. Now he'll go down in history as the tyrant who started it all. I have no desire to follow in his footsteps.\n\"The military are understandably reluctant to back off...on both sides. But if the public knew all that was really happening, all popular support for this war would come to an end and the military would have no choice but to negotiate for peace.\n\"Censorship has, of course, pre-empted that. The armed services have kept a tight rein on the news for years now. Even the best informed people only have an inkling of what is actually happening...and they are all in positions where it benefits them to keep silent. Including myself --- without the web of people suppressing news of me, my whereabouts would be public and hence enemy knowledge. Considering the number of assassination attempts on the mock government at Throne, there is no doubt that it has been censorship that has kept me alive for so long.\n\"But the war has exceeded my limits. I will not stay silent any more. This carnage must stop now. And you have provided me with the means to convince the citizenry of the Union.\n\"Imagine what it would be like if your story was aired. Not just the results of some ten year old archaeological search for...what did you call that planet? Earth?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Dr. Drucker. \"The vernacular name for First World is `Earth'.\"\n\"Yes,\" continued the Secretary-General, \"not just a report on the finding of Earth, but the whole lot. The incident with the Maelstrom, the attack of the Nikaljuk at Janella, the razing of space stations at Turnay and Janella, the destruction of Hardin and Earth...\" Her voice trailed off into a whisper.\n\"There are a number of people in the military,\" said Admiral Perry picking up where the Procurator had left off, \"who don't like this war much either. Enough to force the censors to pause before trying to edit your accounts. The seal of the Secretary-General will weigh heavily in favour of it all being broadcast. We almost got the censors to back down once before. We won't fail this time.\"\n\"But do you really think this will change anyone's opinion?\" asked Dr. Drucker, his voice betraying his tiredness. \"It means a lot to me, but it's my family that's died.\"\n\"Yours,\" said the Secretary-General, \"and the families of billions of others too. And it convinced one of the most militant graduates of the Herculean Naval Academy already, hasn't it, MR. Huston?\"\nJohn made no response.\n\"When I first saw your initial reports,\" continued the Secretary-General after a short pause, \"I saw my chance. If Earth can be an example to us all, we can save the lives of more people than those who perished in our ancient ancestor's forgotten war. It is certainly worth trying.\"\nDeep below the surface of Museum, a trio of technicians lowered the ancient probe into a display case in the newest section added to the archives of the planet. Elsewhere in the room, there were trimenographs taken from the surface of Earth, the whole room dedicated to records from that one planet. Only five years after its dramatic rediscovery, the planet had become the most famous in all the galaxy.\nAcross from the probe's display case which dominated the room, there was a small trimensional plate that showed the Beetle Juice nebula in all its glory. Behind the facade that the plate was mounted on was the story known galaxy-wide of the discovery of Earth.\n\"All set!\" called one technician. Together, they stepped out of the case and signaled to the door keeper that they were finished. The keeper looked at the shining metal package in the display case for a moment, wondering what stroke of luck had brought it to the attention of its finders all those years ago. `How different history would have been,' he thought, `if this tiny machine had not been found when it was.' Then he turned to the door switch and for the first time, the doors to the new Peace Hall were open.\nShining in the bright floodlights that lit it, Pioneer 11 looked down on the flood of school children that scrambled into the room, just arrived on an excursion from their home town on distant Kalgan.\nJesse Allen is a graduate student in Astronomy at the University of Iowa.

Kousen\nCopyright (c) 1990\nIn the cold of the desert night, two figures huddled shivering around a flickering fire. At first glance, they looked rather alike. Both were of medium height and medium build. Both had dark hair and dark eyes. Both leaned in closely to the fire, in an effort to warm themselves.\nCloser examination, however, revealed striking differences between the two men. The face of one showed an expression of worry and fear, as though expecting at any moment to be attacked. His eyes darted from side to side, peering into the darkness. His ears heard every sound, both real and imagined, from the scampering of small burrowing animals to the whistling of the wind through the rolling tumbleweed.\nThe other man, by contrast, was calm. He too shivered, but from the cold instead of fear. His face looked placid, except for an eerie smile. He leaned his shoulder towards the first man and spoke.\n\"You do not have a choice, Vol. If you are going to survive this night, you must kill me,\" he said.\n\"Shut up, Aanoch,\" Vol replied.\n\"You know full well that I would kill you if I were able. You can not watch me all night. I assure you that the first chance I get, I will slit your throat.\" He leaned back, satisfied.\nVol jumped to his feet. \"Damn it, I said shut up! I will listen to no more of your foul treachery. If you are not silent, I will---\"\n\"You will what? Kill me? Fine.\" He grinned. \"Like I said, it is really your only option.\"\nWith a growl, Vol stormed away, but the cold and the darkness prevented him from venturing too far from the fire. Instead, he paced back and forth, beating his arms with his hands to keep his circulation going. Aanoch watched him intently, trying to make eye contact. Vol finally looked up, and for a moment the two stared at each other. Aanoch suddenly grinned, and lunged toward the fire.\n\"No!\" Vol yelled, running to his aid. He grabbed Aanoch by the blanket that was wrapped around him, and threw him back onto to the ground. In the process, the blanket surrounding Aanoch fell away,\nThe loss of the blanket revealed another difference between the two men. Aanoch was bound hand and foot with heavy ropes.\nHe laughed. \"You see?\" he said. \"You can not stop me forever. If you untie me, I will kill you. If you do not, I will find a way to kill myself. If you leave me in the desert alone, I will freeze to death. One way or another, I will be dead by morning.\" He paused. \"And you will pay the penalty.\"\n\"You are insane. I can not help that.\"\n\"It does not matter. You will die.\"\nVol trembled, both from the cold and from anger. \"Does your life mean nothing to you?\" he said.\nAanoch grinned at him. \"On the contrary,\" he replied. \"My life is most precious. But my death means more. My death accomplishes your own, and that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.\"\n\"But what of your clan? Would you sentence them to death as well? Have you no honor?\"\nFor the first time, the smile left Aanoch's face. \"Do not talk to me about honor, you Hull cur. Your clan knows nothing about it. It is we who shall die, to a man if necessary, to achieve the extinction of the Hull clan.\"\nVol's eyes flashed menacingly. He seized the blanket from the ground and advanced towards Aanoch, poised to smother the bound man. Aanoch watched him calmly.\n\"Good,\" Aanoch said. \"Inefficient, but effective.\" He bared his neck to his opponent, and closed his eyes.\nWith a scream of frustration, Vol threw the blanket at Aanoch and stormed off. He looked back just in time to see Aanoch moving toward the fire once again. Vol ran back and pulled Aanoch away.\n\"Now stop that, will you?\" He grabbed Aanoch by the rope binding his wrists and dragged him away from the camp into the darkness. Aanoch made no move to interfere. Instead, he began whistling an odd, rambling tune. Vol dropped him about thirty paces from camp and returned to the fire. He sat down heavily.\n\"You can freeze for all I care!\" he yelled to Aanoch, who just continued whistling a tuneless, melancholy song.\nThe Cooperation Duel was formed to accomplish what centuries of ceaseless fighting had not---the safety of people fortunate enough to have been born in a clan other than that of Hull and Malmeus. Prior to its establishment, the twin clans of Hull and Malmeus had fought an unending war of revenge and counterrevenge, each side performing successively worse acts of brutality until the senses became dulled to the horrors. Children of each clan were taught the use of weapons at an early age and then loosed upon one another. Those who survived were hard and strong, and completely dedicated to the destruction of the other side. Each atrocity brought new cries of vengeance; an eye for an eye trying to make the whole world blind.\nThough many outside clans deplored the violence, the majority of the people took no action. Rather, they felt that the overall good was best served by having the Hulls and the Malmeusians continue to kill each other until both were gone, thus eliminating the problem. Unfortunately, however, innocent outsiders had a habit of `getting in the way' of traps left by one warring clan for the other. Such casualties started occurring with increasing frequency, and when Iir, the only son and heir of the plutarch, died in a Hull explosion, the situation had degenerated too far.\nThe plutarch wanted to stop the fighting entirely, but he knew that was impossible. Instead, he hit upon an ingenious compromise: The Cooperation Duel. Any time a member of each clan came into conflict, they were captured by the plutarch's troops, bound together, and sent into the desert at the Tir Oasis. Their only hope for escape was to reach, on foot, the Oasis of Sil, which lay forty miles to the southwest, deep in the heart of the desert. The ultimate requirement, however, was that they must reach this goal TOGETHER. Neither side was allowed to leave without the other. If either emerged alone, he was put to death and his nearest clansman was sent out in his place. This process would continue until either a Hull and a Malmeusian both arrived at Sil, alive and together, or until there were no members of either clan left to be banished into the desert. Either way, the fighting would be over.\nNaturally, both the Hull and Malmeus clans protested. They soon realized, however, that the weight of public opinion (and, far more importantly, the power of the plutarch's army) was against them. In addition, some of the more aggressive members of each clan viewed the prospect of single combat in the desert with enthusiasm. Among the most vocal of these were Vol, eldest son of the Casar of Clan Hull, and Aanoch, Warrior Chieftan of Clan Malmeus. They were sentenced to be the first pair sent into the desert; to emerge together, or not at all.\nVol slumped listlessly in front of the fire. He was no longer sure how long they had been in the desert. He only knew that what had seemed to be an adequate amount of supplies was nearly exhausted. He thought about this, and decided for the hundredth time that this must be due to Malmeusian trickery and sabotage. He certainly didn't remember using them himself, although he was forced to admit that there were several blank periods of time in his own memory since their entry into the desert.\nStaring into the fire tired him. Slowly, his eyelids drooped downward and his head fell forward. A thought jolted him. If he slept now, he realized that Aanoch would freeze to death before he reawakened.\n\"Just a few minutes, or maybe half an hour,\" he muttered. \"Surely Aanoch can survive that. Let him suffer, anyway.\"\n\"He will not survive. His condition is as bad as yours.\"\nVol rose with a start. He looked around in panic for the source of the answering voice.\n\"Over here,\" it said.\nHe whirled around. Directly behind him, leaning with one leg propped upon a rock, was the Stranger. He was dressed in desert garb, and had a heavy, dark beard that flecked with grey. He looked relaxed and confident, and his eyes bore into Vol with painful intensity.\n\"Who are you?\" Vol asked.\nThe Stranger raised his eyebrows in mild surprise. \"You do not remember?\"\n\"No, of course not. Where did you . . . .\" Vol's voice trailed off into silence. The Stranger did seem vaguely familiar, but Vol couldn't quite place him.\n\"No matter. Place another log on the fire and we will talk.\"\nMystified, but too tired to argue, Vol complied. The Stranger moved toward the fire and warmed himself. \"Feel better now?\" he asked.\nVol realized that he did feel better. Much of the fear had left him, and with it, much of his exhaustion. He nodded.\n\"Good. Then you realize that there is a solution to your dilemma.\"\n\"There is?\" Vol asked, astonished. \"What is it? I must know.\"\nThe Stranger regarded him with a wry smile. \"You do know. You just don't remember it yet.\"\n\"Damn you, don't give me any of your riddles! Just tell me the answer.\" Vol thumped the ground in frustration. \"I am in no mood to be trifled with.\"\nThe Stranger yawned and stretched elaborately. \"All right, ask me yes-or-no questions and I will try to answer.\"\n\"I do not wish to play any foolish games.\"\nThe Stranger didn't reply.\nVol sighed. \"Who are you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Yes? What kind of an answer is `yes'?\"\n\"No?\" the Stranger inquired.\nVol rolled his eyes. \"Very well, have it your way. Do I know you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Are you a member of my clan?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Are you related to me?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Yes? That is impossible. I do not recognize you at all. How can you be related to me?\"\nThe Stranger simply looked at him.\nThe shivers that had left at the Stranger's arrival now returned. Vol rose and paced back and forth in front of the fire. Suddenly he stopped and stared in awe at the Stranger.\n\"Are you real?\" he asked, quietly.\n\"Real enough,\" the Stranger replied. \"Look, leave me out of it for the time being, will you? Aanoch is dying and you are wasting time.\"\nVol turned and looked toward where he had left his bound companion. He realized that the whistling had stopped some time ago. \"I should just let him die,\" he muttered.\n\"No.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I should go save him?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nVol spat in disgust. \"Surely you are not telling me I should forget all of the Malmeusian crimes and walk out of here with him.\"\nThe Stranger smiled. \"No. I said that there was a way out of YOUR dilemma. Not necessarily out of HIS.\"\nA light dawned on Vol's face, as though a long-suppressed memory had forced its way to the surface. He smiled an evil smile. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\nWhen Aanoch regained consciousness, his immediate reaction was to cry out with joy and relief. The frost demons that had haunted his nightmares had treated him with contempt, both for bringing about his own death, and for condemning others in his clan to the same fate. The horrible image of his younger brother Roul staggering in the desert, dying of thirst, had shaken him to the core. How foolish he had been, to force such an end on his own brother!\nThe image of death still hovered just beyond the horizon. Aanoch shuddered. It was one thing to speak of defying death with bravery; it was quite another thing to actually have to face it. His mind rebelled at the memory. He turned away, and accidentally looked directly into the nearby fire.\nNearby fire? he thought with astonishment. He then realized that the ropes binding his wrists and ankles were gone. He was covered with a blanket, resting next to the fire in their encampment. He sat up abruptly and rubbed his stiffened joints.\n\"Feeling better?\" said a voice behind him.\nAanoch turned and faced the speaker. It was Vol, but somehow not the Vol he had left. This Vol did not fear the darkness. Instead, he seemed to welcome it. This Vol laughed malevolently.\n\"Can you move?\" Vol asked.\n\"Yes, I believe so,\" Aanoch answered, flexing his legs. \"You saved me,\" he said, surprised.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"So I can exact my revenge.\"\nWith a laugh, Vol lunged toward Aanoch. Aanoch barely had time to stagger to his feet and dodge the unexpected onslaught. Vol rushed toward him again, fists flailing. One struck Aanoch on the jaw, and he lost his balance. In the process, however, he managed to trip Vol, whose momentum carried him forward until he landed in a heap a few yards away. As Vol started to rise, Aanoch looked around desperately for some way to protect himself. He saw the pile of torchwood off to the left, and seized a log. Swinging it back and forth, he yelled at Vol.\n\"Stay away! I don't want to have to kill you!\"\nVol stood and began talking to himself.\n\"He really doesn't want to kill me, does he?\" he said.\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\nVol laughed hysterically and jumped at Aanoch, who swung the torchwood at Vol's legs. He connected with a sickening thud, and Vol collapsed, still laughing. Crippled as he was, he began crawling towards Aanoch.\n\"Get away!\" Aanoch yelled, but Vol kept coming forward. Aanoch ran to the other side of the fire, where he found the ropes that had until recently bound his own limbs.\n\"Stop!\" he said. \"I mean it. Do not make me tie you up.\"\nVol continued his crawl. With a scream of frustration, Aanoch ran to Vol. He managed to dodge Vol's punches and bites long enough to bind his wrists. Hurt or not, Vol tried to kick him, and Aanoch was forced to bind his ankles as well. He dragged Vol over to a rock in front of the fire and left him there.\nVol appeared to calm down, but as the adrenalin left his system he began to shiver. Aanoch picked up the discarded blanket and wrapped it around Vol's shoulders.\n\"There,\" Aanoch said. \"Now be quiet and let me think.\" He moved toward the other side of the fire and sat down.\n\"You do not have a choice, Aanoch. If you are going to survive this night, you must kill me,\" Vol said.\nAanoch stared at him in astonishment. \"What did you say?\" he said.\n\"I will kill you the first chance I get. You can not watch me all night.\" He leaned back, satisfied.\nAngry, Aanoch jumped to his feet. \"No! Do not do this! Stop, or I will be forced---\"\n\"To do what? Kill me? Fine.\" He grinned. \"Like I said, it's really your only option.\"\n\"Please!\" Aanoch begged. \"We must stop this. We must break the cycle, or we will be doomed to repeat it until we both die. Does that not matter to you?\"\nVol grinned at him. \"Certainly,\" he replied. \"My life is most precious. But my death means more. My death accomplishes your own, and that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.\"\nAanoch pulled his hair in frustration. \"But what of your clan? Would you sentence them to death as well? Have you no honor?\"\nThe smile left Vol's face. \"Do not talk to me about honor, you Malmeusian cur. Your clan knows nothing about it. It is we who shall die, to a man if necessary, to achieve the extinction of the Malmeusian clan.\"\n\"You are not listening! You have not heard a word I have said!\"\nVol leaned in ominously toward the fire.\nRealizing what he intended, Aanoch ran toward him and pulled him away from the fire. He dragged him about thirty paces into the desert, and dumped him onto the ground. He returned to the camp and collapsed. He looked dejectedly into the fire, and listened as Vol in the distance whistled an off-key, melancholy tune.\n\"We are lost,\" Aanoch said out loud. Tears began to pour from his eyes. \"I can not save him, or he will kill me. I can not kill him, or I and others of my clan will die. Somebody please tell me what to do.\"\n\"You must save him,\" said the Stranger.\nAanoch whirled around and faced him. \"What?\"\n\"Surely you realize there is a way out of your dilemma.\"\n\"There is? What is it? I must know.\"\n\"You do know,\" the Stranger replied. \"You just do not remember.\"\nAanoch covered his face with his hands. \"Of course I remember, but I do not wish to. The cycle must be broken.\"\n\"You would rather die?\"\nOnce again, Aanoch saw the Spectre of Death hovering over him, and he could not face it. Aanoch's shoulders slumped forward. He desperately wanted to say yes, but he knew he could not. \"No,\" he said. \"I will do what I must. Yes,\" he said.\n\"Yes,\" he replied, as his mind slipped back into the madness.\nKenneth A.

Let us begin!\"\nThen they jumped him, beat him, bound him, stunned and paralyzed him with strange devices of his own invention.\n\"Stop that nonsense at once, you flea-ridden fools!\" he roared. \"What - in the name of the Eightfold Path, the Seven Sages, the Six Fingers of Time and the Five Wounds of Christ - is this supposed to mean?\"\n\"This is the day of your eclipse,\" they told him as they bound him with chains of rusty iron, semiceramic cables and a monorganic mosquito net of his own invention, \"and the dawn of our ascent.\"\n\"What? Do mere mortals dare to strive with titans?\"\n\"For sixty years you have flooded the world with strange devices of your own invention. You have made and lost and regained fortunes few men would dare to dream about. You have ruled states and business empires. You have engraved your name in bold print upon the history of science and the world - and in letters sixty miles across upon the surface of Mars.\"\n\"I know!\"\n\"And now you are eighty-six years old and seek immortality not merely in the memory of men, but in the flesh.\"\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\"Even now, you are larger than life and maybe larger than legend. Immortal, you would overshadow all the human race. And therefore we must kill you before you can uncover the weird ways of nature and make yourself a god.\"\n\"You cannot kill me!\" he thundered. \"I am stronger than your strongest fears and stranger than your strangest dreams. My voice alone, which rumbles like a mountain, will make your flesh creep and your hearts quake and tremble with envy, anguish and despair. And from my gaze you shrink like T-shirts boiled too hot. You cannot kill a mountain of a man, no more than snails could race a roaring lion.\"\n\"He's right,\" they said, \"we cannot kill a man like him.\"\nSo they blinded him with white-hot glass and broke the fingers of his hands. And they cast him through the shimmering arc bridge and began to celebrate the morning of their fame. But he was washed up on a distant shore beyond the arc bridge, where he soon woke to the cackling of an old woman with a voice as dry as broken bones.\n\"By the Four Corners of the World, the Three Weird Sisters and the double-dealing, two-faced God of Doors - where am I?\" he groaned.\n\"Beyond the arc bridge,\" cackled the old woman. \"But who can tell where that may be? I call this place here Dawn. And who are you?\"\n\"I am Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius, the greatest scientist since Gregory Smirnov passed away.\"\n\"And I am Truant Moonblood, and I was a scientist before you were ever born!\"\n\"What? If that is true -- and I suppose it must be, since it is utterly implausible -- then you must be one hundred and seven years old!\"\n\"And so I am, you incredulous, fork-tongued fiend.\"\n\"And I, who was once an Eye Among the Blind, am now as sightless and unfingered as a worm, and bound and chained and netted like a loanshark's victim!\" he groaned. \"Would you be so kind as to unfetter me and my stumbling imagination by telling me where on Earth - or rather, where in the rumbling bowels of space - I am?\"\nAnd with fingers as dry as broken bones, Truant Moonblood, the ancient scientist, unchained, uncabled and unnetted bald-headed Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius, the giant of science and blinded eye among the blind.\n\"As I told you once before, my youthful, blue-eyed friend,\" she crackled, \"you are in a place called Dawn - or was it Thrawn? - somewhere in the deep gullet of space beyond the simmering bridge arc.\"\n\"Arc bridge.\"\n\"Bridge arc, arc bridge, what in the name of the double-faced God of Archways is the difference? Here we are, and here we stay!\"\n\"Well, maybe,\" Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius mused as he paced across the salty sands and listened to the breathing of the sea. He heard the lapping of small waves, the distant thunder of breakers and the whistling of the whispering wind. He tasted the salt and the bitterness of the air and the loneliness of the beach and of the ancient woman, whose hands were dry as broken bones. He felt alone and bitter and, being a mountain of a man, he felt the mountains far away.\n\"Why did they do this to me?\" he asked himself.\n\"Are you not a giant of science and a mountain of a man?\" the woman chuckled. \"All your life you must have dwarfed mere mortals. And mortals do not care to live in the shadow of mountains.\"\n\"What of it?\"\n\"Were there prophets among them?\"\n\"There may have been,\" he said as Truant Moonblood put splints on his fingers. \"Some had a feverish look that lurked behind their eyes and made them sneeze whenever I stared at them. I thought they had hay fever, but maybe they were prophets.\"\n\"So they decided to cut your throat and rip out your guts and eat your heart and your liver.\"\n\"They did, those small-souled tinkers and thought-cobblers!\"\n\"But they could not kill you, for they did not know where to seek the heart of a mountain. So they blinded you with white-hot glass and broke the fingers of your hands and hauled you through the glimmering arc bridge. For they did not want you to seek the hoary secret of immortality.\"\n\"How do you know?\"\n\"After I had invented the plutonium-powered prayer wheel and transformed Svartvic's equations and built the quivering arc bridge, I, too, turned towards the half-hidden secret of immortality, though yet but forty-six.\"\n\"So they blinded you with white-hot glass and broke the fingers of your hands and sent you through the very arc you had invented to bridge the gulf of space!\" he roared, as the two of them plodded across the bitter beach towards a ramshackle shanty made of driftwood and seaweed.\n\"No. When I was young the men and women of science were gentler and I was but a hill of a woman, not a mountain. So the men just raped me once or twice and the women broke my nose, which was never very becoming anyway.\"\n\"And have you uncovered the grey-haired secret of immortality? As yet I have merely glimpsed dark hints of hairy fairy tails.\"\n\"The giants of old were immortal, but they were giants of the body.\"\n\"And were slain with slings of reason by envious mortals, and are now extinct,\" Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius replied, shivering. \"And this must be the most unkindly, cold and dismal world that I have ever seen.\"\n\"The giants of today are mortal, but they are giants of the mind.\"\n\"And they strive to be immortal, not merely in the memory of men but in the flesh. Yet how, you ancient, cackling, bridge-building priest -- for are not all priests bridge-builders who bridge the gulf between mere mortals and the gods as though it were no wider than that which severs pons from pontifex? -- how is this immortality conceived?\"\nThey reached the ramshackle shanty made of driftwood and seawind howling through its cracks and crevices, leaning like a drunken sailor against the cliff. They entered, and, while freezing Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius sat down in a corner and shivered blindly, Truant Moonblood lit a flickering fire and began to cook a steaming stew made of evil-smelling odds and ends and things better left unnamed. And Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius, who was a mountain of a man, although his teeth were chattering madly to themselves, mused whether the old woman might be mad.\n\"Nietzsche, that mad materialistic mystic,\" she chuckled, \"who was as blind as any Homer and any far-sighted seer, knew that lovers sometimes seek to seem as gods -- and not out of vanity.\"\n\"But what would a blind and bleary-eyed and walrus-bearded prophet know about love? I have loved a hundred women in my time, and I always seemed a god among mere mortals.\"\n\"He also knew,\" the rag-bag chattered, \"that men with loud voices booming in their throats can hardly think subtle thoughts -- and your voice is louder than a raging bullfrog's mating roar.\"\n\"That shows him to be a greater fool than I thought. For what would a dim-eyed, small-voiced prophet know of the mountain men he dreamed about, not even knowing the darkness he lived in to be their shadow? And what would such a temperamental, sentimental mystic know about the full-blooded love of giants? Love is only sex mis-spelled, a prejudice of evolution, no more.\"\nAs the flickering fire and the vile stew began to warm Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius, and his thoughts and senses roamed and measured the ramshackle shanty made of drifting thoughts and seawater seeping in like fog, he became aware of a faint scent which tickled his back-brain, but would not tell him where it came from, nor what it meant.\n\"I could make a better hut than this within an hour,\" he thought. \"I could build a good, solid house within a week, yet there is something strange about this place, and it smells of broken bones.\" But in as dismal a place as Dawn\n\"The collar-bone,\" the old woman said, \"is the key to the secrets of love and immortality.\"\n\"I thought as much,\" rumbled Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius suspiciously. \"No name is ever given without reason. But tell me more about this key-bone, key-stone, key-tone. How will you unlock the clavicle?\"\n\"Every human is born with a splinter of immortality lodged within the collar-bone, but it is later lost in love.\"\n\"You must be madder than a March Hare, and as hare-brained, too! Your wits are whittled away by the whispering winds!\"\n\"Do not speak slightingly of whispering winds,\" whispered Truant Moonblood. \"Do you think it is purely coincidence that we speak of little death?\"\n\"And what about love unfulfilled or unrequited? And what about those who never love? Are they immortal?\"\n\"They may well be. But consider this: the secret of immortal love -- if it was ever known -- has been long lost in the murky mists of time and legend, but still it haunts humanity. And then, maybe, love in itself is immortality, but immortality does not imply invulnerability. And so immortal love may yet be murdered silently, or slowly starved to death by words not said and deeds not done and thoughts not thought.\"\n\"But what about those stone-hearted, never-loving, never-dying men? Where are they?\"\n\"There are but few of them, for they, too, are vulnerable, yet they exist. They are the grey men and lonely spinsters that age and age and watch the world around them falter, fail and die. They are mere shadows, and mountain men like you would not see them, even if they were perched upon their knees. They may be immortal, but they are mortally dull.\"\n\"Then there is no hope of immortality for the rock giants and the mountain men of science?\" Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius pondered as the tickling in his back-brain crept down his spine towards his loins.\n\"No, and there never can be. Mere mortals could not live in the shadows of giants, and if giants were immortal, humanity would wither like a flower lacking light. And evolution must go on.\"\n\"Wait!\" roared Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius. \"There is a tickling in my back-brain creeping down my spine towards my loins, and I smell something fishy!\"\n\"It is the seawind and the seaweed.\"\n\"No! It is you! Your fingers may be dry as broken bones, but you are not as old as you would like to seem!\"\n\"How true,\" said Truant Moonblood, and pierced his heart with a bone-headed spear, for she knew enough of mountains to know where to seek their heart.\nShe cut up his carcass and salted it with sea salt. She boiled his flesh and roasted it and smoked his flesh and hung it up in the ramshackle shanty made of drifting sighs and sea-foam. His bones she used to fill the cracks and crevices that the fog seeped through, but his collar-bone she broke apart and sucked out all the marrow, for Mortimer Slagfire-Sartorius had been a mountain of a man, and there was still some hint of immortality locked inside his clavicle.\nAnd Truant Moonblood wandered once again across the lonely beach and smiled gently to herself. And she sat down to wait for the next giant of science, seeking the secret of immortality.\nMichael Burschik was born in Britain in 1966 and had the ill fortune of being forced to spend most of his life in a miserable Bavarian town within spitting distance of both the former `Zonengrenze' and the Czechoslovakian border.

She sat in a scallop along one wall and the big black cat lay at her feet with its head raised and its huge yellow eyes watchful.\nKiko lost her big cat somewhere between Jin Place and home. It was the third one she'd lost in a month. Tito was going to stop making them for her at this rate ... he was generous, but he didn't like to see his art wasted.\nThe last time, he had said, \"It's not just a matter of waste. It's that now they're out there!\"\n\"But they won't live long,\" she had said in defense. \"You said yourself they don't stay constabulated.\"\n\"I said,\" he answered, \"but that's if nobody else gets hold of them.\"\nShe didn't know what that meant. Tito was an Artist. She didn't know for sure what that meant either. He could make awesome things, like the cats ... things far beyond mere tech ... but he wouldn't even sell them. He could have made a gigantic fortune! But he just gave them away ... to her, and to one or two others. She had never actually seen the others; they came on foot probably, while she came in the Embassy car.\nShe wanted to be able to come on foot also, to slip through street shadows and show up at Tito's like an anonymous. Except her Grandmother, who ruled everything ... at least everything in this capitol city of an occupied nation ... wouldn't allow it. Every time Kiko went out, it was the car, and the chauffeur, an d the personal guard. There was no way she could live a life of her own choice, like everyone else. Wear black clothes, and not sleep, and prowl the streets, and march in foolish demonstrations.\nHer Grandmother was, of course, Dylete Mikyo, the JapaChine Ambassador. She'd had the post for at least 60 years, but had been fixed repeatedly, so that she looked 30, maybe 40 in sunlight. She'd had Kiko's mother and father eliminated ... so Kiko suspected ... and now the only blood-relation she would tolerate i n the Embassy was 17-year-old Kiko, thin and frail. It meant Kiko wa s constantly attended by tutors and guards, and had the surveillance cameras on while she slept.\nAt 16, Kiko had threatened suicide if she wasn't given some personal freedom. She demanded one six-hour stretch every fortnight, with the bracelet monitor off, and freedom to leave the Embassy. She won that, except that she had to be driven to where she wanted to go in the car, then picked up six hours later and driven home. Kiko chose eight p.m. to two a.m. Dylete was hard to sway, but finally agreed when she saw that Kiko was perfectly serious about the suicide.\nThe first time out, Kiko found Jin Place. The second time she followed a bizarre red animal like a fox along the shadowed street, and it led her to Tito's alley, and to his door.\nIt was open. That, in itself, was strange. Nobody left doors open. She stepped in. He turned from a table where he stood working and stared and stared at her without a word. He was old! You scarcely ever saw old-looking people ... not when it was so cheap and safe to get fixed. He was small and thin, with very intense eyes.\nShe let him look. That was what diplomatic life, and being rich, meant ... your gear was the most beautiful, sleek, and costly that was available. Even in diplomatic circles, they looked. Then you looked back at them. Something unspoken was decided. Dylete, her Grandmother, had been coming out on top for 60 years in these contests; now Kiko had the knack also. Maybe because she didn't think anything when the looking contest was in progress. She just waited calmly, knowing she would win. Or maybe she'd inherited something from Dylete.\nTito said, \"Presence without mind. I like that. Maybe I'll give you a gift to go along with it.\"\nKiko was used to that too; diplomats gave gifts to make up for having lost. She held out her hand, expecting some rare object. But he turned and opened a door, and out came a big cat. It was big and orange, striped with black. She'd never seen anything like it. The only animals she'd been allowed to have were little and with white fluff all over. They died after a year or so, looking sad.\nThis one came and stood beside her, lazily switching its long tail. It paid no attention to her, but followed when she went out. She couldn't make it get in the car, but it loped along beside. Before the car pulled into the Embassy gates, however, it had disappeared.\nOn her next free night, she went back to Tito's and informed him about it. He stared at her again, and then gave her another cat. This one was the same size, but sleekly black all over. She took it back with her to Jin Place, where nobody would be surprised by anything. There, there were rich and poor, regal and common, even diplomats, all accepting, or enduring, each other in the haze and music. She sat in a scallop along one wall and the big black cat lay at her feet with its head raised and its huge yellow eyes watchful.\nShe drank an exotic drink, smoked a hookah, and watched the people watching her. The diplomats bowed when they passed her scollop; they knew who she was, what rank. It was a very satisfying evening. But when she tried to force the cat into the car, it turned and loped away into the shadows of the street.\nThe next time, she actually talked to Tito ... the way you talk in private, the way she remembered talking to her Mother long ago.\n\"They won't come home with me. What's wrong?\"\n\"Maybe the breeding isn't right,\" he said.\n\"I never assumed you were breeding them ... there's no breeding stock left. I thought you were making them.\"\n\"No breeding stock left? Ah, so they've educated you a little.\"\n\"I've had the very best education!\" she said haughtily. \"Subliminals every night since I was six.\"\n\"Ah, so you have stored in your head all the world's factoids?\"\n\"Certainly,\" she said.\nThen he explained that \"made\" creatures were outside that paradigm.\nThat made it strangely exciting to her. She wasn't sure exactly why, except that anything beyond tech was exciting because it was forbidden. In any case, she wanted another one.\n\"All right, one more,\" he said. \"But see you don't let it get loose.\"\nNow she had lost this third cat, a blue-grey one. Again she and Tito talked privately, and she became so engrossed that she sat down, no doubt creasing her rich dress, and clasped her jeweled hands together passionately like a child or an anonymous. \"If it could come home with me,\" she said, \"and be in my suite. And maybe even ... this sounds bizarre ... even sleep on my bed. Make it to do that.\"\n\"Why?\" he asked.\nShe thought about it. \"I want to hear its purr in the night. Or growl, or whatever it does.\"\n\"And what will you do?\"\n\"I will\u00e8listen.\"\nAs an incentive, she told him to bill the Embassy, but he sneered at that. Nevertheless, he gave her another cat. It was deep gold with black spots on its flanks. And around its neck was a leather collar studded with chunks of amber. He also gave her a narrow leather leash, which he snapped onto the collar.\n\"No more after this,\" he said, his eyes narrowing. \"Keep this one, or don't come back.\"\nShe didn't even go back to Jin Place. She waved forward the unobtrusively following car, and when the chauffeur had opened the door, stepped in. The lea sh made it possible to pull the big cat in too.\nOn the ride home, she let it lie on the seat beside her, and she used the tips of her fingers to stroke its silky head. The guard at the Embassy gate ma de as if to refuse the cat admission, but she stared at him, and let him look at her staring, so he backed down. Naturally.\nShe took the lift up to her suite. The big cat sat on its haunches, not disturbed by being in the mechanism ... it even lowered its lids slowly once or twice, as if contented.\nShe went through to her bedroom. There, she had the sudden and remarkable desire not to wear any of her sleep robes that night. She slid into the satin naked, and even unplugged the subliminal unit at the headboard. The cat leapt lightly up on the bed, stepped around for a few moments, then lay down. It's head rested on her stomach. She lay very still, waiting to hear its purr.\nThere were alarm shriekers going off somewhere, and people shouting. Footsteps running. She sat up, threw back the satin, and went blindly across the carpet a dozen steps before she even knew she was awake.\nThe double doors burst open. Security guards and male secretaries came pouring in. Kiko watched them look at her with shocked eyes and realized, looking down, that she was still naked. She stood quite still and let them look, thinking nothing. And within a few moments, she had won. They began to make the brief, obligatory bows, and to edge backward out the doorway.\nDylete's Chief of Staff came forward, moving through them and, with his hand trembling slightly, held out a precious object. It was Dylete's Seal of Office.\n\"The Ambassador has met with ... an accident. Which precludes her fulfilling her post. I am now at your service, as you assume the post by heredity.\"\nKiko said carefully, \"How was the Ambassador accidented?\"\nThe man hesitated. \"By laceration s to the throat. The jugular vein was... shredded. There was a great deal of bleeding.\"\n\"Who did this?\" she asked, her eyes wide.\n\"We have not apprehended the....the intruder,\" he said. \"The alarm system was not tripped. We will continue to investigate.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Kiko. She did not look around for the cat which no one was supposed to know was in her suite. She sensed that it was no longer there.\n\"Attend to the body of the former Ambassador,\" she instructed.\nThe Chief of Staff made a formal bow. \"And shall I bring her robe of state to you now?\"\n\"Yes, you may do that.\"\nHe backed out.\nKiko stood waiting. Even in nakedness, she was totally enrobed by presence. But her right hand, unaccountably, lifted slowly to her throat. There was a leather collar studded with amber around her neck.\nAnd there was a taste in her mouth: something strange that she had never before tasted.\nShe suddenly knew much more than factoids. Very much more, all in a rush!\nShe knew about Tito. And why \"made\" things beyond tech were forbidden.\nAnd something about what it was going to be like, being Ambassador, when she was so young and unaccustomed to politics. With four lost cats prowling somewhere. Out there in the shadowed streets, where the great mass of people were anonymous, poor, wore black, and didn't sleep.","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

I can only just vaguely imagine you standing or stooping on the lawn here, perusing these words, but I see so clearly her soft red lips pressed against these delicate petals, her sweet -- forgive me -- her sweet green eyes like these thorns and these leaves.\n--sincerely yours.\nIt wasn't the flowers exactly. Granted, he felt perhaps a little wistful at being on the unromantic end of such a venture, fancied in fact that snatching roses was exactly the sort of thing he might very well have done once himself. When he had loved Annalisa, for example. Or rather, the sort of thing she would have asked him to do for her. (Annalisa: her black skirts and sweaters on such powder-white skin. Her warm, pouting smile and her urgent whispers. How cruel and happy she had been!)\nIt wasn't then the flowers exactly, but something else ineffable about his circumstances, some other condition, of which his loss was only a symptom, that continued to disturb him during the long drive from Mr. Bendices' home to the college that his daughter attended.\nCertainly, some large part of his unease was nervousness about seeing his daughter again for the first time since she had visited at Christmas. Among his circle of high school friends, he remembered, it had always been the girls who had come back most changed by that first year away. How had they changed? At the time, he had suggested (in jaded tones) that he missed a certain aura of innocence about them, but his real feeling was a kind of fear that they had outgrown the old reasons people sometimes have for being intimate and that he had not.\nHe pushed a cassette into the tape deck, Ghould's recording of the Goldberg Variations -- which he had bought expressly for listening to on this trip. He had used to listen to them so often, as an undergraduate, on late winter and early spring afternoons, when the notes smelt to him like the thick pages in his collections of Milton and Spenser, and felt to him like the pleasant weight of theater curtains and the texture of evergreens, and held for him such clear and detailed images of secret and enormous worlds, such spirits of awe and inquiry.\nOn this day though, the notes sounded a little hollow. Although he tried, with mounting kinds of misgivings, alternately relaxing his mind and then forcing what he thought he ought to be seeing and feeling (at this moment, some fragile arrangement of fountains and statues and skies; in the following moment, some vast expanse of soft gray patios, some peaceful motion of swaying trees), his vision kept dissipating whenever he paused to compare it with his memories, or whenever he groped for stronger inspiration or recollection; and his thoughts kept being being strangely and unkindly invaded by the rhythm of phrases he had inadvertently memorized from the roses note. `Pretty instance of, let's see; pretty gift with signature, pretty sweet, my sweet -- forgive me -- her sweet -- forgive me -- her sweet, let's see; thorns and leaves.' In the background, one could hear Ghould moaning as he played. What had that moaning meant to the young Mr. Bendices? Something about compassion that he couldn't quite recollect. He waited for his passions to swell with favorite and familiar passages, only to realize moments later that they had passed unnoticed. And the green countryside rolled idly by Mr. Bendices' car windows and he was so uneasy and so uneasy about being uneasy that he could neither calm his thoughts nor concentrate.\nOnce Annalisa had worn this impossible lily white dress and her hair in wet braids. They had entered some restaurant together and she had smiled shyly at the room as everyone fell in love with her. A waiter watching her stumbled over a stray cart, throwing his tray and sending dozens of glasses and plates crashing into pieces. What color WERE her eyes? Goldberg. Golden rule; ugly self-interest. Once he had given money to an old man on the street and the man had hugged him and wouldn't let him go. One year they left his name off the list and he didn't get any valentines. He was still attractive. He was still romantic. As a baby, his daughter Tracy had been unusually assured and social. Someone had told him that.\nAt length, the disordered vale he had been driving through gave way and the university grounds wound slowly into view. They were peppered with young brown bodies, reveling in their newfound freedom like so many oasis prairie dogs. Some aspect of late May, some essence of frisbees and lemonade, and Mr. Bendices felt a rising sense of shyness and excitement, tugged at his eyebrows absent-mindedly. Girls lay tanning on arrays of blankets. Faint breezes scattering abandoned papers. He saw bare-chested boys and felt that he understood something about their shorts and their sunglasses and their cheerful vulgarity. On the lawn before her dorm, his daughter Tracy played aerobee with a group of her friends.\nThat her friends should also be enjoying the turning of seasons seemed to Mr. Bendices to be a little bit obscene. He had met a number of them before and knew that he didn't much like them. They appeared to him now as a mass of pale, plump white bodies. They were all males, scraggly and unshaven and invariably crouched as cowardly lions, out-of-place out-of-doors, poorly washed and poorly dressed. Their smiles had too much lust and innocence about them.\nHe had listened to them speak, so arrogant and passionate and smug about their silly fantasies, so delighted in their tiny introverted, well-ordered worlds, so vicarious and lifeless with their science-fiction and their computers and their ludicrous games. And his daughter in the midst of them, worshiped like some reigning geek queen.\nTracy was lovely. She had auburn hair and gray-brown eyes and such soft, peach, freckled skin. He watched her play -- so young and happy, her movements so graceful.\nHe pulled up alongside the curb where her laundry bags and suitcases lay in a heap. When she finally turned to see him, a wide, pretty smile spread across her face.\n\"Daddy!\" in the feigned little-girl voice that had always annoyed him (this time it didn't) and the gnomes she had been romping with stopped and stood up straight and looked at him as if he'd disturbed playing kittens or frightened away some just-discovered gazelle.\n\"Put the napkin in your lap, Dad.\" Tracy had arranged for the two of them to have dinner with a few of her friends and their parents at Seagull Street. They were seated closely and uncomfortably around a polished wooden table set at the edge of a dock over an artificial lake. Fragments of conversation drifted down to them occasionally from a sexless couple seated at a balcony somewhere in the darkness above them. Everything was lit dimly: the walls adorned with anchors and lengths of rope and paintings of ships and storms and seas.\nMr. Bendices was irritated at being instructed in etiquette in front of Tracy's friends' parents. He was irritated by the situation in general, especially anxious as he was to speak with his daughter again alone, and he waited with a sublimity of patience for the evening to end.\nTracy's friend Gavin balanced a steak knife between the prongs of his fork, held it there unsteadily with his thumb. \"Hand phaser,\" he declared, \"Meem.\" His skin was tragic and he would always laugh too loudly and too long.\n\"Cricket, might you pass me the wine list,\" Tracy's friend Richard suggested in a strained English accent.\n\"Huh, what?\" asked Mr. Bendices.\n\"He calls me Cricket,\" Tracy explained.\nHe kept thinking that his situation was an almost laughable one, but couldn't make himself take this attitude towards it and only became (by slow degrees) more angry. That Richard's father, for example, with his round, wrinkled gray face and his blue velvet bowtie, should be smiling with insane pride as his son scrambled for intimate tones with Tracy -- seemed to Mr. Bendices almost conspiratorial, almost too comic to be believed.\n\"Ale!\" screamed Gavin, adopting an earthy tone, \"tankards here, wench!\" Their waitress -- an attractive college-age girl, wearing a half-slit bermuda skirt and a hawiian-print polo shirt -- paused at another table to look towards Mr. Bendices' group with some disdain. He was uncomfortable at the head of the table. Sitting there indicated too much authority over and association with the assembly, like being the best man in a ceremony where one hates the bride. He stared intently at the empty chair at the end of the table across from him.\n\"Gavin has an exceptional imagination,\" his mother confided. She wore a faded blue jumpsuit with a golden belt around her waist. Heavy black earrings hung within the coils of her dirty-blond hair. She kept rubbing her eyes, which caused the powder on her face to roll up into tiny balls. \"He's always off working on one of his dungeons,\" she said. \"Or doing research for one of his medieval dungeons.\" Gavin's mother beamed beneath her powder. \"Gavin always says that it's so important for every little detail to be AUTHENTIC,\" she said, touching Mr. Bendices' hand and pronouncing the word authentic as if it were some epically clever punch-line.\n\"Is that so?\" Mr. Bendices inquired. He had noticed a pink splash of calomine lotion on his daughter's ankle before she had changed clothes and it had set him to remembering something. He and Annalisa had once slipped through the locked gates of Los Altos Golf Course on a humid August evening, the moon and headlights from the rustling highway shone reflected in the course's various ponds.\n\"He's also a POET...\" Gavin's mother began.\nTracy's friend Daniel hiccupped at the opposite end of the table without seeming to notice that he had done so. Daniel's parents hadn't come; they wouldn't arrive until the following day. Of all of Tracy's friends, Mr. Bendices liked Daniel the least. His body was always making strange noises, but he almost never said anything himself. He would sit and stare at Mr. Bendices with dull, subdued eyes as if he would rather be in anyone else's company. He smelled like fallen crabapples.\nAcross the restaurant, a young blond-haired man, wearing black suspenders and a black tie over a baggy white smock, jumped suddenly to his feet, fell to his knees, and asked the woman he was with if she would marry him. The woman laughed and blushed and cried a little and said that she would.\nRichard's mother noticed that there were bright orange fish swimming in the artificial lake and that they looked a little sickly.\nDaniel smiled stupidly at Tracy and she regarded him, for a moment warmly. Their meals had been ordered ages ago and still hadn't come. Only Mr. Bendices seemed to realize that something was wrong. He leaned to his daughter and whispered in her ear, \"I think you are wasting your talents, honey, on hearts too easily broken.\" Although he was serious, he meant for her to take it jestingly. He meant to sound tender, even accepting. But he felt compelled also to make her see that he still believed she had a destiny in leagues above those of her playmates and that he wanted to re-establish an old sort of candor between them. She looked at him with an odd mixture of love and disappointment and he felt afraid for an instant that someone must be scheming to take the loveliest things in his life away from him.\nThe dandruff against Gavin's glasses was sparkling in the candlelight as he discoursed giddily on; surely everyone was staring or pretending not to except for Daniel now smiling absently into space. Sometimes Annalisa would get up in the middle of class, run wonderfully out and into the street, trailing scarves or papers or whisps of perfume.\nMr. Bendices loosened his tie and unbuttoned the top of his dress shirt. It was as if he had been sitting in that chair his entire life, as if he could hardly breathe. He was aching to move, to run perhaps and to feel the night air against his face, and to take Tracy away with him and away from them. Free summer evenings spread before him like well-ordered constellations. He could remember quite clearly when they had first driven her to school nine months earlier. They had traveled late at night, and the stars and the lights of the towns, and the soft green glow of the console instruments in his car, and the weight of the darkness, make him feel as if they were inside of some slow spacecraft, moving bubblelike between immense and mysterious worlds.\nHe stood up and was a little dizzy and faltered somewhat on his feet, pushed hard against the table, tipping the empty chair at the other end into the artificial lake, scattering pumpkinseed fishes. He had taken hold of Tracy's wrist and she was looking at him quizzically. Gavin and Richard laughed with abandon. Their parents looked ready to forgive him. A group of busboys moved to fish the chair out of the lake. There was a long moment of silence.\n\"She cracks me up,\" one of the voices in the balcony above them was saying, \"She'll tell you TO YOUR FACE that she'll do it and then just like that, she won't do it. What is she THINKing? It's like absolutely TO YOUR FACE and she doesn't even try or anything...\"\n\"Daddy?\" Tracy laughed nervously.\n\"I've just remembered,\" Mr. Bendices stammered. \"I've just remembered, so sorry.\" He let go of Tracy's wrist, brought out his wallet and began shuffling through bills but found that he couldn't count them, threw them all on the table. \"It was so nice to see all of you again, it just can't be helped,\" he said. \"Difficult to believe. I've only just remembered.\"\n\"What is it, Dad? What?\" He turned away from them and found his footing. \"We'll be right back,\" Tracy said. That was good.\nHe was more anxious still because their looks around the table had been so sad but that escape he experienced as a moment frozen -- or rather his egress seemed to have no ending, as one falls in dreams. Bric-a-brac evolved on the restaurant walls with endless variation around their flight. Hostesses and busboys wove lethargic about them. He couldn't look at her. Directionless, they kept making wrong-turns into the same cloak-room and he felt their progress slow and slow, collapsing almost into point where he felt that his failure was much less recent, more ineluctable than he had originally believed. An old and impersonal theft. Then, also suspended, there was the melancholy and the relief of a sort of surrender to it and he held so tightly to his daughter's hand, feeling nothing.\nMichael Arner is a Math\/Computer Science and Creative Writing Major at Carnegie Mellon University.

The palmtop computer sorts them automatically into one of three categories: Accidental Death, Murder, and Suicide. Accidental Death has the most entries (205), but Murder is a close second (199). Suicide lags far behind (45), and most of those are variations on a few themes.\nThe most recent entry is a Murder entry. He got the idea in the cab on the way from the downport.\nMURDER 199: The chiphead that shared my taxi decides I am worth robbing. He breaks into my hotel room, and is halfway through my things when I return from dinner. Using an implanted launch pistol, he blows my heart out. I have enough time to write a last \"I love you, Larrine\" on the carpet, in blood.}\nHe isn't really being fair in that one, and he knows it. The chiphead had turned out to be a pretty nice guy, after he'd gotten to know him. A little odd, but then, they all are.\nHis name was the first odd thing. No, his hair was the first odd thing. It was a fluid, black mass dotted with microlights, a kind of model of the universe. The tiny white illuminators were so strong that the effect stood out even in full daylight. Woodstock couldn't help but stare, and soon noticed that the chiphead was staring back.\n\"Like it?\" he said, shaking his head and causing the lights to dance wildly.\n\"Sorry.\"\n\"Sorry why? For noticing? Don't you think that's why I do it? I'd be pretty dumb not to want people to notice.\"\nWoodstock hadn't said anything. Chipheads are a dangerous lot. The synapse-inhibitors, flatliners, and other drugs they do make them unpredictable. Say the wrong thing, and they're just as likely to vape your head as laugh. Woodstock hadn't wanted to die right then, not until he was sure there was no hope left for him and Larrine.\n\"My name's Richard,\" the other said, extending a slim, pale hand. When Woodstock took it, he was surprised by its warmth. It seemed to tingle with energy, perhaps having something to do with the lights. Perhaps some sort of weapon.\nHe dropped the hand as soon as he introduced himself, before this stranger named Richard could up the voltage. Turning to look out the window, he told himself he would not stare.\nFor the remainder of the ride, they said nothing more. Then, when the taxi reached Woodstock's hotel, Richard spoke.\n\"Why are you here?\"\nNot \"Thanks for letting me share the cab,\" or \"Have a nice vacation,\" but the question that had been on Woodstock's mind ever since he'd left his homeworld, Galondin. And one for which he had no answer.\nRemembering it, he sits on his bed and wonders what Richard had meant. Had he known what Woodstock was thinking? As far as Woodstock knows, there are no psionic implants available. He doesn't know much about cybertech, though. Cybers are illegal on Galondin.\nHe pushes the thoughts aside and decides to go shopping. He skips the hotel gift shop and opts for the bright lights and bright colors of the shops on the street. They line the boulevard as far as he can see. Swahla's, Honest Blodgett's, Nuclear Ned's Powerhouse Bar & Grill, Chingteh's Casino.\nHe starts his buying odyssey at Swahla's with a very bright Yatiin shirt. On the back, a buxom dancing girl moves in the light. Next, he purchases a holographic paperweight with Yati afloat inside and \"Gem Of The Universe\" engraved in gold on a fauxwood base. He hums a requiem as he spends.\nSUICIDE 46: After spending all my credit, I starve to death in the streets of Yati, surrounded by bags on non-returnable souvenirs. Unless I die of pneumonia first from sleeping in the rain.}\nHe puts on the shirt and places the paperweight in one of its wide pockets. The weight stretches the shirt a bit, but it beats carrying around a bag all day.\nWhile buying some Yatiin scene tiffs for his wallscape back home, he asks the clerk, a cute blond named whose nameplate says \"Ayram,\" for the name of a good restaurant.\n\"Sheabin's is good, and it's just around the corner,\" she says, smiling a goddess' smile.\n\"Great. When do you get off?\" It's reckless, but he's got nothing to lose.\nAyram smiles again, but this time it's not so wide.\n\"Sorry, but I've already got two jealous husbands, and they've made it quite clear that they don't want a third.\"\n\"I don't want to marry you,\" Woodstock says, \"I just want to take you out for dinner. Consider it a very generous tip for such efficient service.\"\n\"Here's your receipt, sir,\" she replies, holding out the slip. \"Thanks for the offer, but I really can't.\"\n\"No problem. You change your mind, just let me know, okay?\"\nShe nods and smiles again, and Woodstock leaves. Out on the sidewalk, he takes a deep breath of the warm, floral scented air. Overhead, the sun shines in a cloudless cobalt sky.\nSo I failed, he thinks. So what. I'm here to have fun and I'm not going to let it bother me.\nHe turns the corner, finds Sheabin's, and goes in.\nTwo hours later, he finds himself at the allumer table. He's convinced that he's just had the best meal of his life. The Atlantan bluecrab legs were split and heavily buttered, and the body stuffed and basted with a slightly garlicky cream sauce. Fresh bread and an exotic salad filled what little space the crab had left, and he'd washed it all down with an expensive red wine called Brutezza.\nHe plans on spending the rest of the night gambling, making a big strike. He needs more credit so he can spend more tomorrow. It's the only thing that makes him feel better.\nThere are fourteen other players at the table, making it a full game. As soon as one drops out, another quickly takes his or her place. It's not long before the seat next to Woodstock opens up, and who should fill it but Richard.\nHe's still wearing the outfit he had on in the cab, a black synthskin jumper that matches his hair. His carry-on bag is over his shoulder, and the only other piece of luggage he'd had in the taxi, an instrument case, is missing. Woodstock wonders why he would leave one in his hotel room, and not the other.\nRichard comes to the table with a fair-sized stack of chips. Apparently, his luck has been better than Woodstock's.\n\"How's the luck run here?\" he asks as he sits down.\n\"Not bad, not good.\" Woodstock has fewer chips than when he started, but this round seems to be going his way.\nAnje, the waitress, comes around regularly with free drinks for all the players. All except Richard, that is. Woodstock suspects that she's been ordered not to serve him. He looks around and notices the pit boss staring at Richard. An icy feeling stirs his gut.\nRichard doesn't notice. While the rest of the table gets hammered on their free booze, Richard stays sober and keeps winning. His chips pile up, while everyone else's dwindle. Players begin to drop out faster.\nWhat really gets to Woodstock is that the cyber doesn't even seem to care. Sure, when things are going right, you tend not to get flustered. But there's a unnatural calm about Richard, and Woodstock suspects he'd act the same even if he'd just lost everything. It's as if it's the game that's important, the fun, rather than the money.\n\"I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" The pit boss has suddenly appeared at Richard's elbow, with two large bouncers flanking him.\n\"Why?\" Woodstock says, jumping up from his seat. \"What's the problem.\"\n\"Relax, Woodstock. It's okay. I was just finishing anyway.\"\n\"Yeah, I bet you were, chip,\" the pit boss says. His nameplate reads Mr. Puppenase. \"I bet you got a nice little program runnin' to beat this game, huh.\"\n\"No, actually I don't.\"\n\"Save it. Look, your kind ain't illegal here, but it ain't welcome, either. Now you can choose to leave on your own, or I can have Beni and Touch here escort you out.\"\nRichard smiles, as if he's sharing an inside joke with an old friend.\n\"You're absolutely right,\" he says, and collects his chips. Woodstock collects his, too, and all five walk to the cashier's booth.\nThe cashier gives Woodstock his fifty credits, which he has her post to his account. As she counts through Richard's chips, Woodstock counts with her. His total is a hundred credits more than the money she hands to Richard. He starts to say this, but his friend silences him with a look and a smile.\n\"Thank you,\" Richard says, taking the cash. He peels off a fifty credit note and hands it back to her. \"And this is for your trouble. Have a pleasant evening.\"\nHe turns from the booth and heads for the door, leaving Mr. Puppenase, Beni and Touch behind. Woodstock hurries after him.\nMURDER 200: I am beaten to death by two huge bouncers named Beni and Touch, because Richard has hacked them off. My only crime is that I was with him.}\n\"They chizzed you, you know,\" Woodstock says, once they are outside. \"You should have got a hundred credits more.\"\n\"Depends on how you choose to look at it. I think I chizzed them.\"\n\"You mean you really did have a calc chip in?\"\n\"NO!\" Richard's angry tone takes Woodstock by surprise. When he continues, he is calm again.\n\"How else can you choose to look at that situation, and say that I robbed them? Think about it before you answer.\"\nThey walk along in silence, Richard taking in the night sky, Woodstock staring at the ground in thought.\n\"You know,\" Richard says, \"the body does funny things to help us think. When we try to remember something, we look up and to the right. When we try to create something new, like trying to think of a name for something, we look up and to the left. And when we are deep in thought, we tend to look down.\"\n\"Well, I was deep in thought, until you interrupted me,\" Woodstock says, casting an annoyed glance at his companion. \"But what's your point?\"\n\"My point is, everybody thinks in pre-established, age-old patterns. If people look up instead of down when they are deep in thought, maybe they'll find a new way of thinking about something. If they choose to think differently, they will.\"\n\"Anyway,\" Woodstock shrugs, \"I can't think of how you beat those guys, unless you mean that you walked out with more than you walked in with.\"\n\"Exactly!\"\n\"Richard, everyone does that! Yatiin casinos always let the players win, so that they spend it all, and more, in the Yatiin gift shops and such. Yati subsidizes the casinos for just that reason. You don't think they kicked you out because you won too much, do you? No way! They kicked you out because you're a -- \"\nWoodstock stops, catching himself before he actually says the words.\n\"I'm a what?\"\n\"A, well, you know, a...\"\n\"A what? A person?\"\n\"No. A chiphead. Their term, not mine.\"\n\"You heard them say this?\"\n\"No, but what did you think they meant by 'your kind'?\"\n\"If you didn't hear them say it, it's your term.\"\n\"Richard, really, it's not.\"\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Richard says, his hair imitating the night sky, \"because I'm not one.\"\n\"That's a good way to approach it. Refuse the label. Fight the prejudice by not being angered by it.\"\n\"No, Woodstock, you don't get it. I'm not cyberenhanced. There is no silicon in this body.\" As if to prove his point, the lights float up out of his hair and begin to dance in the air.\n\"What,\" Woodstock says after a moment, \"are those things?\"\n\"Just a miracle.\"\nWoodstock stares at the dancing lights, then starts walking stiffly across the street towards a bar called Tough N' Eddie's.\n\"I need a drink,\" he calls over his shoulder, but Richard is right behind him.\nFour hours later, they're in Jaeiou's Groundzero Lounge, having been kicked out of three others. Everything in the bar is chrome, and red and orange lights glare off all the surfaces. Each table is surrounded by a hush field, and can be programmed for whichever kind of music the customers desire. Woodstock and Richard have chosen nothing, so everything is silent. The only outside noise that intrudes comes when the waitress enters the field to take their order or bring them drinks.\nSitting in this haven of silence, they have talked about many things. Woodstock has learned that Richard has just come from Onyx, and is a wandering minstrel, a synthar player that plays when and where he gets the chance or the inclination. He would play now, but his instrument has been stolen.\n\"I was trying to explain to the desk clerk that I really had made reservations two weeks ago, and that they must have made an error. While I wasn't looking, someone walked off with my synthar.\"\n\"Did you tell the police? Did you ask the clerk if he'd seen anything?\"\n\"She, and no she hadn't. And the police weren't very helpful either.\"\nWoodstock knows why. Everyone on Yati thinks, as he thought, that Richard is a chiphead. In fact, Woodstock isn't sure what Richard is. After the incident in the street, they never talked about it. He needed a few drinks first, which he now has, and so he asks.\n\"What the hell are you, Richard?\"\n\"I told you. A musician.\"\n\"You know what I mean.\"\n\"I'm just a person, just like you. Just like the pit boss and the cashier and the desk clerk and the police. People, every one of us.\"\n\"Except you're the only one who has dancing lights in his hair.\" Woodstock downs the last of his Nixx, and signals the waitress for another.\n\"I told you, it's just a miracle. No big deal.\"\n\"No big deal, huh. Just a miracle.\"\n\"You've got it! You really are a quick study, you know. Most people take a few lifetimes to learn the commonality of miracles.\" He smiles his placid smile again, the one that is starting to get on Woodstock's nerves. It's a smile that seems to say \"I have a secret, and I'll only share it with you if you're nice to me.\"\n\"I've got it? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about!\" He realizes he is yelling, and grins sheepishly at the waitress who's just entered the field to give him his drink.\n\"Look, Woodstock. Miracles are everyday things. Life is a miracle. This table is a miracle.\"\n\"How is this table a miracle?\" Woodstock examines the chromed fixture. It isn't even an attractive design.\n\"Think about it. This table is made up of millions of molecules. Tiny little things we can't even see, and yet they are holding up this glass.\" He raises his glass, which has only water and a slice of Deluran candyfruit in it, and then sets it back down with a loud clink. \"What gives those little things the strength to do that, hmm? Why doesn't the glass just sink right through it, like it would if this table were made of water? As a matter of fact, why doesn't it just pass right through it as if it were air? Air is made up of molecules, too.\"\n\"I dunno.\" Everything Richard is saying makes sense to Woodstock, but he writes it all off to the Nixx.\n\"Me either.\" He picks up the glass again, then drops it from about four inches over the table. It passes right through.\nWoodstock quickly looks under the table, amazed. What is even more amazing is that the glass is just hovering in the air as firm as if it were sitting on the table.\n\"For that matter,\" Richard says, looking under the table with Woodstock, \"Why does it pass through air? If a table molecules can hold it up, why can't air molecules?\" He grabs the glass and sets it back on the table. This time, it stays.\n\"Once you start questioning the why of reality, you realize that nothing is real.\"\n\"Oh fuck,\" is all that Woodstock says, and lets his head fall hard against the very real table.\nMURDER 201: Richard convinces me that I can pass through solid matter, and tells me to step in front of a speeding gravcab to prove it. I am so drunk, I believe I can. The gravcab reminds me that I can't.\n\"What is that?\" Richard leans across the table to look at the datpad.\n\"My death diary.\" He shoves it across, and his friend picks it up. After reading a few entries, he shoves it back with a frown.\n\"Woodstock, why are you here?\"\n\"You asked me that at the hotel.\"\n\"And you never answered.\"\n\"Ah, yes. Well, the short version is that I was dropped by a woman I planned to spend the rest of my life with.\" He slugs down the rest of his Nixx, and signals for yet another. He's beginning to think that Richard is right about this whole reality thing. He feels like he is floating.\n\"So you came here to forget her, and fantasize about death.\"\n\"No way can I forget her. We're soulmates. We're meant to be together.\"\n\"No you're not.\" Richard smiles again, and Woodstock fights the urge to break his teeth.\n\"How would you know? You don't even know her.\"\n\"If you two were soulmates, don't you think she would realize it too? Since she doesn't, you aren't.\"\n\"Oh, I forgot. You know everything.\"\n\"When you get past your pain, you'll realize it's true.\"\nThe bartender enters the hush field, bearing Woodstock's drink. He sets it down in front of Woodstock, but his eyes are locked on Richard.\n\"Don't you think it's about time you chummies hack out?\" He's a big man, and his stance and eyes are threatening.\n\"Dammit, I am tired of getting thrown out of bars. My friend here is a human being, just like you and me. What the fuck is your problem?\" Woodstock manages to get to his feet, but he's having trouble staying there.\nThe bartender looks at him, then stares at Richard again.\n\"I don't count cyboys as being the same as you and me.\"\n\"You know what you are?\" Woodstock starts. Before he can finish, Richard stands and grabs his arm.\n\"We were just leaving. Sorry about the trouble.\"\n\"Trouble? You ain't seen trouble yet, pal,\" Woodstock shouts. The heavy paperweight in his pocket is making it difficult for him to keep his balance.\n\"Come on, Woodstock.\" Richard pulls at his friend's arm.\n\"Better listen to your chum, cyberlover.\" The bartender takes a menacing step towards them.\n\"Cyberlover? You overdeveloped, glandular freak. You wouldn't know a true implant from a... a...\"\n\"Come on, Woodstock.\"\n\"From your own, steroid-shrunken willy!\" Woodstock grins broadly and looks at Richard, proud that he is able to finish the insult in such a grand manner. When he looks back, it's just in time to see the fist.\nThe next thing he knows, he's in the dark. At first, he thinks he's dead. Then he feels the hand that is still on his shoulder.\n\"Richard?\" He looks over, and sees the lights in his friend's hair. \"Where are we? Why does it smell so bad?\"\n\"We're in the sewer below the bar.\" That answers both questions.\nWoodstock looks down and sees nothing. He does, however, begin to feel the slippery ooze soaking through his shoes and pants legs.\n\"How?\"\n\"Well, it's the funniest thing. Remember our talk about molecules before? Seems they decided not to hold us up at just the right time.\"\nWoodstock starts chuckling and slowly builds into a full- scale guffaw. Soon Richard joins in, and they laugh together until the sewer is filled with their echoes.\nHe wakes up on the steps of The Night Fantastique, a local pleasure palace. Someone is shaking him gently, telling him he has to leave. He sits up, groggy but not hung over. Every detail of the previous night is clear in his head. Every word spoken still echoes as if it's just been said.\nHe searches his pockets to make sure everything is still there. Next to the paperweight, he finds a folded napkin.\nIt was a pleasure to spend the evening with you. I am sorry we did not get the chance to finish our conversation, but the authorities insist that I leave. I hope we got far enough along for you to figure the rest out. I am sure we will meet again, if we choose to. Until then, take care. -R\nWoodstock stares at it for a moment, then re-folds it and places it back in his pocket. He hails a cab and takes it back to his hotel.\nAfter a quick pass through the sonic shower, he packs and touches the comm link.\n\"Front desk,\" says a polite, female voice.\n\"This is room 1342. I will be checking out immediately. Could you please send someone up for my bags?\"\n\"But Mr. Bach, you are still registered for five more days.\"\n\"And I imagine you'll credit my account for that, won't you?\"\n\"If you choose.\"\n\"I do. Thank you.\" He touches the link again and silences it.\nSitting down at the room's data terminal, he brings up the hourly departure schedule for the starport. There's a ship going back to Galondin, one heading for Onyx, and a third heading for Etherea, one of the outermost planets of the Imperium. He logs a ticket for Etherea as the porter arrives for his bags.\nOn the way to the starport, the gravcab passes Swahla's. Something in the window catches Woodstock's eye, and he has the taxi stop.\n\"How much for the synthar in the window?\" he asks the clerk. It is a man this time, perhaps one of Ayram's jealous husbands.\n\"A fine instrument, sir. Not many -- \"\n\"Look, I'm in a hurry. The meter's running on the cab there. How much?\"\n\"Five hundred credits.\"\nHe crosses to the window, lifts the synthar and its case out of the display.\n\"It's used. See, there's a custom's sticker still on the case.\" And sure enough, it's the Onyx Customs Bureau. \"I'll give you three hundred, that's all. No dicking. Like I said, my meter's running.\"\nThe clerk nods, and Woodstock hands him his credit chip. He also gives him the paperweight.\n\"What's this?\" The clerk eyes it with suspicion.\n\"Gem of the Universe. I'm returning it. It's flawed.\"\nDave Borcherding was born, raised and, regrettably, still lives in Cincinnati, Ohio. He writes mainstream fiction and science fiction, and has a novel in progress (PANGAEA).

I'm not the type of eternal who becomes so consumed with boredom that I take to \"playing\" with poor, stupid mortals. No, what hurts is the drudgery of it all, watching the world decay with pollution, war, and assorted vices. But then, who am I to complain about vice? I'm a satyr.\nMy birthname is Thaylos, but I've gone by a variety of names over the years. I was born in Greece in the Hellenistic era, some two millenia ago. I am one of the youngest of my kind; as far as I know the last satyr born came sometime during the years of the Roman Empire, and the oldest can be traced back over three thousand years, maybe earlier.\nI've got gripes with everyone---with humankind, with the Olympians, with my own kind. The Olympians gave up trying to be almighty and the humans wasted everything Zeus gave them. The gods, for the most part, are sulking up on their mountain, unworshipped and ignored outside the classroom, having contests to see who's the most depressed. A few still walk the earth. As long as love exists, Eros and Aphrodite will have something to do. Artemis is currently masquerading as the president of some women's magazine, I think, and Zeus joined a bowling league because he liked the thunder-sound made by the ball hitting the pins. The old geezer doesn't chase women anymore; Hera keeps him on a tight leash. Hephaestus mucks around grumbling about steel workers getting the short end of things. Apollo's become a yuppie. But the worst of the lot is my \"lord\", Dionysus. All he does is drink, keeping himself in a perpetual stupor, dreaming of the days when he used to dance with his maenad priestesses. Imagine that: the god of wine an alcoholic. The irony disgusts me.\nBut at least the great gods have Olympus. The rest of us are stuck down here, in this foul air and spoiled earth. The older satyrs tell me Dionysus used to invite them up for parties, but someone put the moves on Hera and that was the end of that.\nI suppose you'd think we lesser deities spend our time hiding in the mountains and forests, away from humans. Some do---I know I appreciate fresh air and clean water---but a good many of us live among you. The various nymphs have become environmentalists and activists, working for organizations like Greenpeace, the EPA, and the SPCA. As for my kind, the satyrs generally enjoy human company. We have ways of hiding our nonhuman features in your presence. There are many of us; chances are you've seen or met or even lived with one of my kind, or even me.\nWe are the dirty old men, the lovers of porn, the party animals, the playboys, the clubhoppers. We may own the liquor store or Musicland down the street. We are the beautiful men, the happy-go-lucky, the greatest of lovers. We are the unfaithful and multi-partnered. We are the men who will live with but never marry you; we are the ones you love but will never make a commitment.\nWe never truly mean it when we say \"I love you.\"\nThat hurts me, which is unusual. Satyrs are not supposed to love or give a damn; it is implanted in us to live and love for the moment, to be perpetually happy. But I look out at the world and see the love beneath hate and poison of the modern society, and I wonder, Why can't I share it?\nNot to say I haven't tried. I have. I've gone to therapists and I've read books. I've acted in passionate plays in the dim hope it would spark something within me. I've tried to be committed to one woman. I've tried to love, but nothing works. There's a void inside me. I cannot love, only lust; I feel no need or desire for a significant other in my life.\nI used to be normal and happy. I never used to complain. When the last of the Olympians was dumped for Christ, I said, \"Who cares? We're all eternal. The party doesn't have to stop.\" The party didn't stop, but it did become erratic. As the Christian Church grew more and more powerful, the world became less and less inviting. Most of the satyrs slept through the Dark Ages. I made the mistake of not sleeping in long enough. Curious and impatient, I woke up to the world of the Inquisition. There were few satyrs around. For the first time I was frightened---and alone. Too disturbed to go back to sleep, I wandered through Europe hoping to find some company. I did.\nShe was young and pretty and much brighter than the other peasant girls. She had a wonderful imagination. When she could, she would sneak away to the fields to play with me. I became her secret friend. I thought I loved her. I cared for her so deeply I revealed my True Form to her, goat legs and all. Of course she ran away from me---women ALWAYS run from satyrs---but when I caught her she was laughing and enchanted.\nShe made the mistake of telling someone she had a half-goat for a friend, and they burned her as a witch. I was devastated.\nThree days later, I was in another village, lusting after another young woman.\nAnd then it hit me what I had done. I realized I hadn't TRULY loved that poor girl, or any other woman or nymph I'd ever been with. I loathed myself. Over the years, I attended fewer and fewer satyr gatherings; eventually I stopped going altogether. Europe degenerated. It began to weigh heavily on me. I thought that foul continent would suffocate me, so I ran away to Asia, where I had some peace of mind. A good friend called me back to Greece in 1785. I found out that far away, across Poseidon's waters, was an endless new land and a budding nation. A few satyrs had made the journey a hundred years earlier, and had just sent word back how beautiful it was. I went to England and took the first ship to America I could find.\nIt WAS beautiful. I ran with the buffalo through the Great Plains, skipped through the Rockies, and wandered through the woods. In 1790, a group of wood nymphs migrated over and I lived with them. I almost forgot about other satyrs and women and humankind in general. For just a while, I felt good again.\nAll that changed with the settlers moving further and further west. I soothed the nymphs as they cut down the forests. I choked on their trains' fumes, watched them shoot buffalo for fun, saw them destroy the natives of this country. It was Europe all over again. I went south to Mexico and beyond and found the same thing had happened there. Eventually, I ended up hiding in a corner of Canada, sulking.\nSatyrs, however, are social beings, and after a time the loneliness was driving me crazy. I bounced from country to country, never happy with what I found. Finally, I gave up. I ended up back in North America, and have more or less stayed here for the past century. In some respects, it's been amusing, watching the United States grow and advance so quickly. I've enjoyed the music, the television, the movies, motorcycles, fast cars and jet-skis. But the air and land have become foul, and underneath this mask of a happy, productive society there's poverty, stress, and social hangups. The ways of the Greeks and Romans are gone forever.\nLike Europe, America began to get me down. My black moods began to affect me. By 1980 I had completely lost my sexual appetite. As of the Fall of 1990, I had been celibate for ten years.\nI believe that beats the previous satyr record by nine years, 364 days, and twelve hours, give or take a few minutes.\nIn September, 1990, I went to Pittsburgh. It's so suited for brooding. I'd been there in the 1700's when it was a beautiful speck of the frontier: three rivers, green hills, and only a couple of ugly forts. After I moved west, I heard the Industrial Revolution had turned it into a filthy, cold city, so I avoided it until that year, when I overheard someone say it had improved. Curious and bored, I went back and found them scraping a century of grime off of the Carnegie Museum and certain other buildings around the city. But really, it wasn't so bad; the downtown area is a pleasant mix of old and new, fairly clean and not that unfriendly. The rivers' junction has become a park with a huge fountain. The weather, however, hasn't changed a bit. On some days, the sky takes on a familiar dingy cast, occasionally dumping rain. It's those wet days that are so perfect for being depressed.\nLate one morning, I went downdown. There's an adult book, video and \"toy\" store there, and as I passed it I felt a tingling inside me. I crossed the street and lingered near the door; the sensation grew stronger. I didn't really want to go in that place. At that point in my life, the thought of smut made me queasy, but I gave in and stepped inside. Immediately, a smell hit my nose; pleasant, musky and familiar to me, undetectable to humans. I can't fully describe it, but it was definately satyr-smell. I looked around, sniffing the air, and finally saw him.\nStanding casually near the wall of magazines, smiling as he looked over the titles, was what appeared to be a middle-aged man, dashing and trim, with a tidy grey beard, glasses, and a double-breasted suit. He turned and smiled as I walked over to him.\n\"Well, well, well...\" he murmured with a cultured, British accent, his smile broadening.\n\"Sir William,\" I greeted happily, and embraced him. \"It's been too long.\"\nHis name is not in fact \"Sir William\", but Euriphides. He'd picked up the title by accident, and, fancying the Isles, has lived under the name and guise of a successful producer and entrepreneur for all these years. Euriphides is a different kind of satyr; a selini, to be exact, one of the oldest of our kind. The selini are usually seen on old wine vases; they are the original servants of Dionysus. Euriphides is half-man, like me, but the rest of him---his legs and ears and tail---is horse, not goat. He's one of my dearest friends among the eternals. When I was very small, I used to tug his tail and call him \"father\", although there's a very low probability that he actually is.\n\"It HAS been a while,\" he told me, and leaned a bit closer. \"What are you calling yourself nowadays, Thaylos?\" he asked quietly.\nI shrugged. \"I have a Minnesota driver's license which says I'm Theodore Petersen.\"\nHe arched an eyebrow. \"What a dreadfully tacky name. I shall have to call you `Teddy', then.\" He chuckled, then asked, \"What brings you here?\"\n\"The gods only know,\" I replied. \"And you?\"\n\"I just decided to take a little trip to the East Coast cities.\" He waved a stack of magazines in front of my face. I caught the titles `Big Man' and `Whipworld'. \"You know, do a little shopping, eh? Know what I mean?\" He nudged me, smiling more broadly.\nI groaned. Euriphides is a dirty old satyr if there ever was one. For all outward appearances and his love of culture, he's had sexual relations with just about everyone---and everything---imaginable.\n\"I've been having a lovely time,\" he went on. \"I went out to the fraternities over at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University---unbelievable! I filched some freshman student I.D.s, altered my looks, and snuck in for Rush. You've got to try it, Teddy. There's music and women and dancing... those frat brothers may as well be satyrs, the way they drink! The beer is endless... have you been out there?\"\n\"To Oakland? Yes, I've been staying in Schenley Park.\"\nEuriphides squinted. \"Are you feeling all right?\" he asked me suddenly.\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"Why?\"\n\"Well,\" he murmured, frowning, \"You're not aroused. Are you ill?\"\nWhile eternals don't die, we are capable of feeling pain and getting sick, so it would seem only logical that a young satyr without an erection must be unwell. \"No, I'm fine, really,\" I said.\nEuriphides leaned close. \"I can make you feel better,\" he cooed, giving me the seductive eye.\n\"No, not today---FATHER,\" I quipped, not wanting to hurt his feelings.\nHe looked hurt. \"You wound me!\" he moaned.\n\"I'm sorry, Eu---Sir William. I... I just don't feel up to it---no pun intended.\"\n\"What d'you mean, you don't feel like it?\" he replied in surprise, and put a hand to my forehead. \"Are you sure you're not ill?\"\n\"Positive.\"\nHe smiled. \"Poor kid,\" he said, ruffling my hair, then chuckled and lowered his voice. \"Or should I say ram?\" he corrected, squinting to see through to my True Form. \"Your horns have come in so nicely. You're looking like a bighorn sheep.\" He paused. \"Speaking of which, did I ever tell you about the time I---\"\n\"Many times,\" I smiled.\n\"I forget sometimes you're not a child anymore,\" Euriphides admitted. He played with a tress of my long, curly hair, staring at me fondly. \"While we're on that line of conversation, it may interest you to know that your favorite playmate is in town, too.\"\n\"Minorus?\" I replied. \"I haven't seen him in ages! What's he up to?\"\nEuriphides shrugged. \"I don't know.\" Again he drew close to me to mumble in my ear. \"I haven't seen him, but I caught his scent earlier today. He may still be in this area.\"\n\"Great,\" I said, \"I should go look for him. Why don't we get together for dinner or something?\"\n\"How about `or something'?\"\n\"William, please...\"\n\"All right,\" Euriphides groaned, giving up, \"Meet me at Jimmy Tsang's tomorrow at seven, and if you find Minorus, then by all means bring him.\"\n\"You bet,\" I told him, and left the store.\nI couldn't find Minorus. In the late afternoon I gave up searching and went to a grocery store to get something to eat. I was looking over the fruit, considering picking up some apples for Euriphides, when I noticed a young man staring at me. As I looked over at him he looked away and absently surveyed a passion fruit. I ignored him, but couldn't help noticing how he kept watching me---and and the passion fruit. He was an androgynous type, lightly built and very pretty. The human form I happened to be using at the time was not far from my True Form---long, curly, rust-colored hair, smooth face, grey eyes, average but fit build. Quite attractive by human standards. I decided he was hitting on me. I was hardly in the mood for this sort of game, and since Euriphides wasn't there to take over, I moved away and went over to the deli. The young man followed me discretely, still carrying a passion fruit. I got a sandwich and went back to the produce section for the apples.\nI saw the guy following me as I walked back to produce, but when I got there, there he was in front of me.\n\"What do you want me to do, Thaylos, shout?\" he snapped, throwing me the passion fruit. I was so surprised I barely caught it. \"Get a clue,\" he added with a sneer. He looked at me hard, and when I stared back I saw him for what he was.\n\"Cupid,\" I muttered, and sighed. I don't like Olympians.\n\"That's `Eros' to you, pal,\" he growled. \"Watch your attitude.\"\nAgain I sighed. \"Well,\" I asked, \"What do you want from me?\"\n\"You,\" he told me with a fair amount of distaste, \"are a disgrace to your kind. Mother and I can feel your black thoughts all the way up on Olympus.\"\n\"Why should you and Aphrodite care what a lowly little faun like me feels?\" I replied, not bothering to hide my annoyance.\n\"Because it's giving us a headache! We're all connected, you know. Satyrs are not supposed to be unhappy and celibate. You're supposed to be out screwing everything in sight!\"\nThe little bastard was starting to annoy me now. The way he felt about my kind was quite obvious. \"Some of us have higher standards than that,\" I replied, trying hard to control my anger. This isn't an easy thing. Satyrs' emotions are intense. Usually, however, we only radiate lust and happiness and content. Although we're not violent by nature, an angry satyr is not something you'd want to meet in a dark alley.\nEros cringed. \"You see?\" he groaned, \"Stop it, for Zeus' sake! Over the years you've only gotten more and more morbid. All of the other satyrs send me pleasant feelings of lust, but your depression bores into my skull like a stake. It gets stronger every day.\"\n\"So why don't you just tune out my bad vibes?\" I asked him. \"It's none of your business what I feel anyway.\"\n\"I CAN'T block you out. If something happens to a nymph or an animal, Artemis knows, because the woods and everything in them are her kingdom. If something happens to a naiad, Poseidon knows. Satyrs overlap. You belong to Dionysus, but Artemis is aware of you because you live in the forests and fields. *I* am aware of you because your kind radiates feelings associated with the realm of Love. Do you understand?\"\nI nodded. \"Yes, but what do want from me? What can I do?\"\nHe was very frank. \"Get laid.\"\n\"I don't feel like it.\"\n\"I know. You're not even aroused. For you, that's an illness. The cure is to have a few nice flings.\"\n\"But I'm not interested.\"\n\"You don't have to lie with a human. In fact, it might be better if you were with a nymph or another satyr. Euriphides is in town; I'm sure he'd be willing to help you out...\" Eros flashed me a smile.\n\"I've already spoken with Euriphides,\" I said flatly. \"Look, I'm just not interested. I don't care who it is.\"\nEros shot me a dark look. \"You'd better care,\" he said. \"You're not living up to your kind's standards and you're annoying the hell out of me. Trust me---Aphrodite with PMS is bad enough. Aphrodite with PMS AND a satyr-induced headache is terrifying. Now you change your attitude, Thaylos, or I'll change it for you.\" He came very close to me, and the next thing I knew he was digging a Beretta 9mm into my gut.\nI laughed. \"What are you going to do, KILL me?\"\n\"You're as stupid as the goat's ass you wear,\" he replied.\nI glanced down at the pistol and saw that it wasn't just a pistol. \"Oh,\" I said, but couldn't stop smiling. \"You can't affect me,\" I told him. \"Satyrs lust, not love, and your shots are for love.\"\nEros narrowed his eyes and took on a wicked smile. \"Try me,\" he said. \"We'll see how much you know about my powers.\"\nI shrugged. \"What happened to your trusty bow and arrow?\" I asked, glancing at the Beretta.\nHe pocketed the pistol. \"Times have changed,\" he replied, and left me standing alone among the apples.\nI went back to Schenley Park, got deep into the woods, took off my clothes, and began the Change. It's a somewhat uncomfortable process, but I've learned to live with it. I suppose the worst part---worse than the itchiness of having fleece sprout from your legs---is having your knees bend back the wrong way and your feet change to hooves as you go from man to goat, or vice versa. Either way, I always spend a couple of minutes stumbling around, getting used to walking a different way. Having the horns, the tail and the goatee sprout isn't exactly fun, either. You see, when I walk in public as a man I can't simply project an illusion; if anyone bumped into me they'd feel the truth, and besides, pants wouldn't fit. When Euriphides looked at me closely and saw my True Form, he wasn't seeing through an illusion, but concentrating on me in order to get a mental impression or feeling of what I actually look like.\nAfter the Change, I stretched out my legs and shook my tail a few times to get loosened up, then took off running, easily going up and down the steep, wooded hills human visitors find difficult. After a few minutes, I picked up a small stone, right in the cleft of my right hoof, and had to stop to pull it out. It was wedged in tightly, trickling a little bit of blood, and it hurt like Hades. When I finally pulled it out, I saw the damage wasn't too bad, but decided to stay off my feet until it stopped hurting.\nAs I sat there, there was a rustling in the bushes. I saw a human coming through the brush. My immediate instinct was to bolt, but as I tried to get up a force held me back. An instant later the human was standing there in front of me, and all I could think was, `Why isn't she running away?'\nShe was tall and well-built, wearing a perfectly pressed, spotless business suit, which I found interesting because we were in the middle of the woods on damp ground. Her dark hair was pulled back into a bun, and a pair of roundish glasses was perched on her nose.\n\"Know me, Thaylos,\" she said, and I did.\n\"Artemis...\" I choked.\nShe curled her lip. \"That's `divine lady' or `mistress' to you,\" she replied. \"And just so you know, I've been going by my Roman name for years.\"\n\"Oh, I---eh, yes, Diana.\" She stared at me, and I swear her eyes glowed. \"Divine mistress,\" I amended, but the contempt I felt was leaking through. She saw it, but for some reason dismissed it.\n\"Never mind,\" she said. \"You can just call me `Artemis' or `Diana'. I didn't come here to have you revere me.\" She stopped again, then added, \"Not that I'd want one of your kind worshipping me anyway.\"\nI narrowed my eyes at the Olympian. \"Then why are you here?\" I asked, still trying to hide my distaste, even though I knew she could feel it. The Virgin Huntress is a positive sort of goddess, but she has been known to become violent, especially toward the male sex. As much as I didn't care for her or any other Olympian, I didn't want to provoke her.\nShe sighed heavily. \"We have a problem. A very big one. Do you know the story of Prometheus?\"\nI shrugged. \"Sure. He helped Zeus overthrow the Titans, then gave the humans fire. Zeus tied him up to a rock for that.\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"He was eventually freed by Hercules.\"\n\"But what else?\" Artemis prompted.\n\"What,\" I replied, \"You mean the prophesy?\" Again I shrugged. \"Prometheus claimed that one day Zeus would have a son capable of overthrowing him. Eventually he and Poseidon found out the woman who would have the child was the sea goddess Thetis, but she married a mortal, King Peleus.\"\n\"No,\" Artemis told me, \"She didn't `marry him', but was married off by Zeus and Poseidon. She had no choice.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" I replied. \"What's the point?\"\n\"Prometheus' prophesy has come true.\"\n\"But that's impossible!\"\n\"Why?\"Artemis paused and stared at me, her face grim. \"No one can escape Fate---not even the gods.\"\n\"But her son was Achilles, and he was killed in the Trojan war.\"\n\"Exactly. Thetis didn't know why she was forced to marry Peleus. She was very bitter. Her only joy in life was Achilles. It was the gods who caused the Trojan war; the Olympians meddled in it, and because Apollo guided the incompetent Paris' arrow, Achilles died. That seemed to be the end of it. But I've found out that it wasn't. Years later, Prometheus went to her. He hated Zeus and wanted revenge, and Thetis was the one who could give it to him. He explained his prophesy to her, and she was furious at the way she'd been manipulated. That combined with the loss of Achilles pushed her over the edge. She seduced Zeus and bore a son, which she hid from all of us.\"\nI rolled my eyes. \"SHE seduced ZEUS? Isn't it usually the other way around?\"\n\"She pulled his own trick on him,\" Artemis explained with distaste. \"She turned herself into a white cow with sex appeal and Zeus went for her when Hera wasn't looking.\" She paused to scowl. \"Daddy was in a wicked mood that day.\"\n\"I still don't understand why---\"\nThe goddess cut me off. \"Her son's name is Aetros, but that's all I know about him at the moment. I think he's going to make a move soon.\"\n\"But that still doesn't explain why you're telling me!\" I snapped.\n\"Because no one else believes me,\" she replied.\n\"I don't think I do.\"\nArtemis sighed. \"Well the Olympians don't either, and I'm afraid to go to the other Titans, because they're probably lined up behind Prometheus. The lesser gods wouldn't believe me, either, mostly because Zeus and Hera didn't. The nymphs, who also thought I was crazy, don't consider our politics their business or concern, and the satyrs are too drunk and silly and powerless to be any help.\"\n\"So why are you talking to me?\" I demanded.\n\"Because you're different,\" she explained. \"I heard Eros complaining about you and got curious. I've been watching you. You're of a different state of mind than the other satyrs. I thought that just maybe you would listen and believe me. I think maybe you can help me. I don't know how, but I do know I can't handle Aetros alone.\"\nwhy should I help you? You Olympians disgust me.\"\n\"If Aetros is capable of overthrowing Zeus, he can easily deal with your kind and anyone else in this world, mortal or eternal.\"\n\"Why should he care about the satyrs? No one else does, except Dionysus.\"\n\"He could overthrow Dionysus. Aren't you bound to protect your master?\"\n\"Frankly,\" I told Artemis, \"I'm fed up with my master.\"\n\"Listen,\" she hissed, \"I can't say for sure, but I've got this gut feeling that Aetros carries his mother's and the Titans' grudges to an extreme. I don't know what his powers are, but I know he's stronger than any of us, and I have a terrible feeling he's going to announce his presence soon, and not pleasantly.\" She grabbed my shoulders and shook me. I was impressed that she touched me at all. \"You're the last one I can turn to. Please help me. I'll reward you.\"\nI snorted. \"What can you give me?\"\n\"Anything. You can live on Olympus, be a master of your kind, have a harem of nymphs---\"\n\"I'd sooner castrate myself than live on Olympus, and I don't want any power.\"\nShe was getting desperate. \"Then what do you want?\"\nI stared her down and decided to play her game. \"I want to love.\"\nArtemis frowned. \"What?\"\n\"Satyrs are incapable of loving. I want to love.\"\n\"I can arrange that.\"\nI pulled away from her. \"Leave me alone,\" I muttered. \"Let me be miserable in peace, okay?\"\nThe goddess stepped back. \"Think about it,\" she said. \"I'll be back.\"\nShe seemed about ready to go, but I stopped her. \"Artemis,\" I asked, \"Are there any other reasons you bothered to come to me?\"\nShe gave me a thin smile. \"Well, one more. I knew that in your current state of mind you wouldn't put the moves on me.\" She sneered. \"After all, isn't it every satyr's pipe dream to diddle the Chaste Goddess?\"\nShe spread her arms wide and took on an eerie glow. A moment later she was gone.\nI went back downtown the next day to look for Minorus. Artemis' words filled my head. At the time, I didn't know why. She was a bitch, I kept telling myself, just a cold, condescending bitch with a nastier case of hormonal imbalance than your average satyr. Still, it bothered me. Unless it really was that important, why else would she mess with a satyr, and an unimportant one at that? She certainly didn't like me or any of my kind. Seeing Eros on the same day as the Huntress only made it worse. I felt like I was being watched.\nI tried to push these thoughts away as I got off the bus on Fifth Avenue and searched for Minorus. I tried going to the head shops, liquor stores, and adult bookstalls, but there was no trace of him. The most I found in those places was the lingering scent of Euriphides.\nMy patience (or what little bit of it satyrs are allotted) was finally rewarded as I passed Sak's Fifth Avenue, a posh, expensive place. Somehow I managed to catch Minorus' scent through the fumes of a passing bus. I went into the store.\nHe wasn't immediately visible, and I had no idea what form he was currently wearing, so I relied on my nose. Eventually his scent mixed with the scents of many other animals, and soon enough I found myself among the fur coats. There were saleswomen, rich women, and wishful girls going through the coats and jackets, but no men. I was confused. I didn't think Minorus would bother to make himself look like a woman unless he was trying to sneak into a harem or convent. But sure enough, his scent grew very strong as my eyes fell upon a middle-aged woman standing in front of a mirror, a saleslady fawning over her.\n\"Isn't it just lovely?\" gushed the young sales rep.\nThe older woman petted the coat she was wearing. \"It's so soft!\" As she paused to glance at the price tag, I cleared my thoat. She turned and looked at me. \"And what do you think?\" she asked.\n\"It's... it's very nice, ma'am,\" I replied a bit awkwardly, because I realized as she spoke that she was indeed a she, and not Minorus. It had to be the saleslady then, I decided.\n\"It's, eh, a bit pricy, though,\" the older woman remarked, fiddling with the tag.\n\"Oh,\" the saleslady replied, \"but it's worth it! That's the finest Persian lamb I've ever seen.\"\nAnd then I took a good look at the coat.\nI gasped so loudly they both turned to look at me. \"Are you alright, dear?\" the older woman asked, but all I could do was shake my head and gasp some more.\n\"Are you having an asthma attack?\" I heard the saleslady say.\nI remember screaming and running from the store.\nI don't remember how I got back to Oakland.\n\"I told you so,\" I heard Artemis say.\nI came to my senses. Noise and fumes filled my head. I was under a train bridge in the brush, and the locomotive and its cars were rumbling past. My clothes were in a heap beside me, and I was in my True Form. I pulled at the soft wool on my legs and burst into tears. For the first time in my life, I had been truly terrified. For the first time, I was in anguish.\nThe train passed, and when I looked up, sniffling, there was Artemis, standing across the tracks. She walked over to me.\n\"You shouldn't risk letting people see you in your True Form,\" she said flatly, but I could see in her eyes she was amused.\n\"Who cares if someone did?\" I managed to groan. \"It would just end up in the `World Weekly News'.\"\n\"I take it you encountered poor Minorus, or what was left of him.\"\nI buried my head in what is approximately my knees and nodded. \"How?\" I wailed.\n\"I told you Aetros was powerful,\" Artemis replied, unsympathetic.\n\"But satyrs are eternals!\" I wailed.\n\"I know. That's what makes him more powerful than any other god. Now we know. Aetros has the power to kill eternals---you, me, even Zeus. My guess is that Minorus was only an experiment.\"\n\"H-how did you know?\"\n\"As much as I despise you oversexed beasts, you are part of my domain. I told you I thought Aetros was going to do something, so when I felt something wrong in the back of my mind, I looked into the matter and found out Minorus had been murdered.\"\n\"What did Dionysus say?\" I asked. \"He has to know.\"\n\"He's too drunk to notice. He felt the pain---I remember him screaming one night, just before I noticed something wrong. He made it go away by drinking himself into a deeper stupor.\" Artemis sighed. \"He may know, but just may not want to deal with it or believe it. No one else would. I talked to the other Olympians again, and they still wouldn't listen.\"\nI got a hold of myself and wiped my eyes. \"But how? How could Aetros kill an eternal?\"\nThe goddess grew very serious. \"Somehow, he's found the eternals' Threads of Fate---possibly the gods', too---and somehow he has the power to cut them, although I'm sure it isn't easy, even if it is his natural power.\"\n\"Why aren't the Fates doing something about this?\"\n\"I don't know. But I suspect it has something to do with the fact that I can't find them.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" I told her, \"How could the gods not believe you, with an eternal dead and the Fates missing?\"\n\"Because they're too self-centered!\" Artemis snapped, disgusted. \"They insist the Fates have to be SOMEWHERE, and they refuse to believe that Minorus is dead. They think I'm either making it up or playing a joke on them. They wouldn't believe me unless they saw his cut Thread, which I don't have. The death of an eternal is simply unimaginable to them.\"\n\"It was to me, too,\" I moaned. \"I'm sorry I didn't believe you.\"\nArtemis sighed. \"Even if I did have his cut Thread, they probably wouldn't care. Hera said, `What's all the fuss? Even if it were true, there's a big difference between us and simple eternals. One simply cannot kill an Olympian. In any case, it's just a filthy, randy little satyr you're talking about---who cares?\"'\n\"Yeah?\" I fumed, \"Well I'M a `filthy little satyr', and so was Minorus. He was my friend!\" I looked up at her. \"So why should you care?\" I asked. \"You hate us as much as Hera does---more, even, because you hate sex.\"\nShe softened, but only a bit. \"I told you, you ARE in my domain, Thaylos. That makes you my responsibility. There's that, and there's the fact that I believe Aetros IS capable of killing the Olympians. It's not just us, either---I think, if given the chance, he'll destroy all of us, gods and mortals. I don't know exactly what he's planning, how many Threads he has access to, or who will be the next to die. Now I'm asking you again: Will you help me?\"\nI heaved a sigh. \"I don't know. I'll have to think about it.\"\n\"All right,\" Artemis agreed, \"I'll give you a day to think it over. We don't have any more time to spare. I'll meet you here this time tomorrow. Have an answer for me.\" She stepped back a few feet, shimmered, and was gone.\n\"Booze,\" I groaned as I slumped into my seat at Euriphides' table, \"I need booze.\"\nHe grinned. \"That's my boy!\" he said. \"I suppose this means you're feeling better.\"\n\"No,\" I muttered, but I don't think he heard me.\n\"Waiter!\" he called, \"We'll have a bottle of some of that nice rice-wine stuff.\"\n\"It's called SAKE, and it's JAPANESE. We're in a Chinese restaraunt.\"\n\"Oh,\" Euriphides said. \"Sorry,\" he told the waiter, \"I meant plum wine.\"\n\"Just bring me a beer,\" I grumbled.\n\"Certainly,\" said the waiter. \"Would you care to order now, too?\"\n\"Just pick something,\" I told Euriphides.\n\"All right,\" he said, scanning the menu, \"We'll have wonton soup and fantail shrimp for starters, then kung-pao chicken, sweet and sour pork, beef lo-mein, mu-shu pork, lobster kew, Szechuan lamb---\" I looked up at him. \"Er, nix on the lamb. Make it Peking duck instead. Oh yes, and some of those almond cookies. And a coke.\" Smiling, he handed the menu over to the waiter.\n\"---and a coke,\" the waiter mumbled as he scribbled on his pad. He took the menu and looked cautiously at Euriphides. \"And that's for---er, that's all for the two of you?\"\n\"Well,\" Euriphides replied, \"We may have a third coming along, in which case we'll just order some more.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the waiter, and walked away.\n\"Sorry about the lamb,\" Euriphides said. \"When you looked at me, I assumed you were a bit sensitive.\"\n\"William,\" I groaned, \"A lamb is a young sheep. A kid is a young goat. I just happened to look at you. Fauns are part goat. It's been thousands of years and you're still confusing them.\"\n\"Well I called you `kid' back in the bookstore, didn't I?\" he snorted. \"Goats, sheep... what's the difference?\" He leaned forward in his seat, a wicked grin on his face. \"They're all the same to me... .\" He sighed and sat back. \"Anyway---did you find Minorus? Is he coming?\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" I told him, \"Oh, Dionysus, did I find him.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"Ask me after I've had a few.\"\nNow it takes quite a lot to get a satyr even tipsy, so \"a few\" turned out to be several bottles of plum wine later. Euriphides asked me about Minorus again as I twirled my chopsticks through my third helping of lo-mein. I told him the whole story; how I found poor Minorus had been turned into a coat and how Artemis had come to me and told me about Aetros and Thetis and Prometheus' prophesy. When I finished, Euriphides simply stared at me for several long moments. Eventually he began to chuckle.\n\"Oh, jolly good!\" he exclaimed, \"Jolly good story, Teddy.\"\n\"I'm not kidding,\" I told him.\n\"Oh, come now,\" he replied, \"Stop teasing me.\"\n\"But---\" I began, but the waiter cut me off as he showed up with the check and our fortune cookies. I plucked one out of the bowl, cracked it open, and pulled out the slip of paper.\n`It is only wise to make decisions in haste', it said, `when a renegade god could cut your Thread at any time.'\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed, and flung the paper away, \"Damn her!\"\n\"Hm?\" Euriphides mumbled as he read his own fortune and tossed it into the ashtray. He picked up mine. \" `Many good things shall come to pass',\" he read, \"---in bed,\" he tagged on with a laugh and a wink. \"What's wrong with that?\"\n\"Nothing,\" I muttered, and got up. \"I'm going back to the park. I need to be alone.\"\n\"Are you sure you're all right?\"\n\"No. Anyway, I bought you some apples. You can come by later tonight to pick them up.\"\n\"Oh, Teddy,\" Euriphides beamed, \"You DO care!\"\n\"Yeah,\" I replied, \"I do. And don't call me `Teddy'.\"\nWhen I got back to Schenley Park, I saw Artemis standing near a birdbath.\n\"I've found out a few things,\" she told me. \"Thetis stole Aetros' Thread from the Fates. She's hidden it in a magical safe-deposit box in a vault somewhere in Idaho. I've also gotten a fix on Aetros, although I don't know exactly where he is. I still don't know where the Fates are. Come here and take a look at this.\"\nI went and stood next to her in front of the birdbath. As she passed he hand over the still water, a picture began to form. It took shape, and I saw what appeared to be a young man sitting at a desk covered with ropes and strings and threads of all kinds and sizes.\n\"That's Aetros,\" Artemis told me, \"and those are the Threads of the eternals and lesser gods. I don't see the Olympians' or Titans' Threads.\" As I watched, Aetros picked a Thread at random and looked it over, studying it carefully. Beside me, Artemis closed her eyes, concentrating. \"That's Euriphides' Thread. You know him, don't you?\"\nMy eyes widened in horror. \"No!\" I cried, and lunged for the pool.\n\"Stop it!\" Artemis hissed, catching me just before my fingertips reached the water. \"If you upset the water you'll ruin the image. There's nothing you can do. Now be still!\"\nTo my vast relief, Aetros dropped Euriphides' Thread and chose another. He looked over another dozen or so before he chose one which caused Artemis to speak again.\n\"That is the Thread of the nymph Calissa,\" she said quietly, \"Your mother.\"\nI remember very little about my mother; most satyrs don't remember their mothers at all. I remember being very small, and her holding me, singing me songs. I remember running through the forest with her. I remember her binding up all the cuts and bruises I got from romping around, and pulling stones from my hooves. Those memories are vague. The only clear memory of her I have is the day she sent me away, when I was ten years old. She and two other nymphs took me to a clearing, and on the other side were three satyrs, a faun and two selini, one of them Euriphides. Calissa began to cry and hug me tight.\n\"Let him go,\" one of the other nymphs said, \"It's time.\" But Calissa wouldn't. The other nymph sighed. \"He's just going to grow up to be one of them,\" she said, gesturing to the satyrs across the way. \"You can't keep him.\"\n\"But he's different!\" Calissa wailed. \"He's my baby!\"\n\"He's not different and he's not your baby anymore. Just like any other animal, a satyr is only cute until he grows up.\"\n\"Oh, let her be,\" the second nymph put in, \"it's her first.\" She patted Calissa on the shoulder. \"You'll get used to it, dear,\" she soothed.\nFinally, Calissa gave up and shooed me forward. I was starting to get nervous, but I took a last look at her and went over to the satyrs. I remember Euriphides looked very tall to me. He smiled and offered me his hand, but I took his tail instead. As they led me away, I looked back and saw the nymphs were gone.\nI've seen Calissa several times since. The first time I saw her again I tried to talk to her, but the words wouldn't come out. Instead, I was overcome with satyrlust, she with satyrfear, and I ended up chasing my own mother.\nI blinked and looked back into the pool. Aetros put down Calissa's Thread and chose another, a delicate, golden one. He smiled terribly as he wrapped it around his hands and began to pull. His body began to radiate an aura of power and strength.\nAfter a moment, the Thread snapped.\nArtemis stiffened and screamed. She thrashed the water with her hand, then collapsed. I knelt beside her, frightened and unsure of myself, but after a few seconds she came to and sat up.\n\"Are you all right?\" I asked.\n\"I---I think so,\" she replied in a shaky voice. \"That was one of my nymphs. I felt it---it was like part of me had died.\" I helped her to her feet. \"Listen, Thaylos---I know where Aetros' own Thread is, and I know of a sword that might be able to cut it. During the Trojan War, Thetis commissioned Hephaestus to make Achilles arms. There was a shield and armor, and I think there was a sword, too. The sword, if it exists, would probably be in Thetis' cave with the rest of the armor. She's away right now---there's been an oil spill somewhere---so if we work fast she'll never know what happened. There's a young sea-nymph---younger than you---named Nysis who lives in the Atlantic, off of New York. Every night she comes to the beach to watch the sun go down. If you can get her to bring you Achilles' sword while I get Aetros' Thread, we may be able to stop this.\" Artemis looked me in the eye. \"Please help me,\" she said.\nI bit my lip. \"Okay,\" I replied at length. My voice was low and husky. \"I'll try.\"\nWe turned sharply as we heard someone approach us from behind, and were relieved to see it was only Euriphides.\n\"Well,\" he crooned, smiling from ear to ear, \"I'll be damned to Hades. Little Thaylos and Lady Artemis!\" His eyes lit up. \"Did you actually catch her?\"\n\"No,\" I replied. \"The Huntress just needs a favor.\"\n\"I'll give her a favor...\"\nArtemis scowled. \"Wipe those thoughts from your mind, or I'll make you a gelding!\"\n\"Really, Euriphides,\" I scolded, \"this is serious. How would you like to go nymph-hunting in New York with me?\"\nI don't know how it was possible, but his smile broadened. \"Why, Thaylos!\" he said, throwing an arm around my shoulder, \"I'd be delighted! I do believe you're getting better!\"\n\"Now,\" I said to Euriphidies the following day as we crouched behind a grouping of rocks, \"Do you remember what to do?\"\n\"I wait until the nymph is preoccupied with the sunset, then get her!\" he exclaimed, shaking with anticipation.\n\"Right. And---?\"\n\"And then we have a Menage a Trois!\"\n\"No!\" I told him. \"For the last time, we're not going to have sex with her.\"\nEuriphides was taken aback. He had a minuscule attention span and probably didn't even remember that we'd gone over this half a dozen times already. \"What do you mean, we're not going to have sex with her! Satyrs always have sex with the nymphs they catch. That's the way it is, my boy!\"\nI growled in exasperation. \"Look---how much self-control do you have?\"\n\"What?\" he replied, gazing eagerly out at the ocean.\n\"Never mind. Just remember to do what I told you.\"\n\"Hm?\" he replied, still staring at the sea, \"Oh---oh yes, of course, Thaylos.\"\nWe sat on the New York beach for another hour or so, and then the sun began its turn downward to the horizon. The beach was empty, so Euriphides and I had no qualms about shifting to our true forms. He immediately went about brushing out his beard and horse's tail, claiming he wanted to look good for Nysis.\nEventually, we spotted her coming to shore a short distance away. She walked through the cold waves to the beach, shook the sea-water from her hair, and sat down on the sand, turning west to watch the sun.\n\"Now, Thaylos, now?\" Euriphides whispered.\n\"Wait,\" I told him.\n\"Now, Thaylos, now?\" he repeated not half a minute later. Again I told him no. After a couple of minutes he seemed about ready to explode.\n\"Nysis looks like she's not paying attention,\" I murmured. \"Why don't you try sneaking around behind her and---\"\nNo such luck. With an obscene whinny, Euriphides jumped from behind our hiding place and lunged at the nymph, who immediately screamed and ran for the ocean. He only had two hooves, so he couldn't maneuver the same way a centaur could, but after three thousand years of chasing nymphs and women (and men and livestock and strange vegetables), he was quite agile. He was unable to cut in front of her to block her escape to the water, but he did manage to come close enough to catch her ankle in his hand. Nysis went sprawling at the water's edge, clawing at the wet, oozing sand as Euriphides hauled her in. She was screaming so loudly I was afraid the police would come, but I waited until he dragged her farther upshore before I joined the action. I jumped on Euriphides and threw him off her.\nAs Artemis said, Nysis was younger than I was, and my guess was that she'd never been caught before. That, combined with shock and the sight of two satyrs fighting over her kept her glued to her spot. Otherwise, she would have run back to the sea in an instant.\nMy problem now, however, was Euriphides. Having no self-discipline, as far as he was concerned I was truly challenging him for his prize, and he was fighting for real.\n\"'Riph,\" I grunted after he landed his hooves in my ribs, \"Stop it! Don't you remem---\"\nIt was no use. He launched himself on me again. I realized the nymph wasn't going to sit there forever, so I head-butted my old friend as hard as I could. The curves of my horns connected solidly with his skull and he slumped to the ground unconscious.\nPanting, I tried to talk to Nysis, but she only screamed again. She got up and ran for the water, but I managed to pull her down. She pummelled me with her fists, thrashed her legs and bit me, but I held her tight. Finally, she stopped struggling.\n\"Please don't hurt me!\" she cried, and burst into tears.\n\"I don't want to hurt you,\" I told her. \"Just calm down and listen to me.\"\nShe sniffled and looked at my crotch. \"Oh,\" she said, and started to laugh, \"Oh, Poseidon! You couldn't even if you wanted to!\"\nI made her look into my eyes and put on my best pitiful expression. \"I know,\" I said, cracking my voice a little. \"That's just it! You're the only one who can help me.\"\n\"Why should I want to help you?\" she replied. \"The other nymphs told me satyrs are nothing but trouble. If I don't help you, there will be one less problem for us to worry about.\"\nI squeezed, out a few tears and thought depressing thoughts, hoping she'd pick them up. \"Please!\" I begged. \"A satyr without an erection is like---I can't think of anything worse! My brothers will reject me! I'll be all alone! Please help me...\" I bowed my head and cried.\nBehind me, Euriphides came to and with a savage growl pulled me off Nysis. `Damn!' I thought, `She'll get away for sure now!' I head-butted my companion into oblivion again, then spun around. To my surprise, Nysis was still there, sitting on the sand.\n\"Why didn't you run away?\" I asked.\nShe smiled. \"Well, you can't hurt me, for one thing. But mostly I felt sorry for you.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"The other nymphs always told me, never trust a satyr because they're never sincere. But you are. I can feel it. You really are unhappy.\"\nI was so impressed by this remark I started to feel bad I'd fed her the lie about being sick. But then, I told myself, according to Euriphides and Eros I WAS sick. \"Oh,\" I repeated, unable to say more.\n\"So what do want from me?\" Nysis asked.\n\"Do you know Thetis the Silver-Footed?\" I asked.\n\"Oh yes, but she's away right now.\"\n\"I heard. I was told that during the Trojan War she had special arms made for her son Achilles. I know that after the war they went to Odysseus, but that somewhere along the line she got them back.\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Anyway,\" I went on, \"I was told that if I performed a ritual with Achilles' sword---if it exists---it would heal me.\"\n\"It does exist,\" Nysis informed me, \"I've seen it.\"\n\"Good! Please, can you get it for me?\"\n\"Oh, I don't know... I mean, it belongs to Thetis, and we all know how much she loved Achilles.\"\n\"Please,\" I begged, \"I'll only need to borrow it. I'll have it back before she returns.\"\nNysis stared at me hard, thinking it over. She glanced at Euriphides' prone form. \"All right,\" she said at last, \"I guess I owe you.\" She smiled. \"And I kind of like you.\" I smiled back at her. \"Thetis' cave is far away. If I leave now I can be back at dawn.\"\n\"Wonderful,\" I told her.\nShe got up and headed into the waves. \"By the way,\" she said, \"My name's Nysis.\"\n\"I'm Thaylos,\" I replied.\n\"Well... See you at dawn, Thaylos,\" she said. She dove into the water and was gone.\nBehind me, Euriphides stirred. \"Gad, what a headache,\" he groaned.\nI helped him up. \"Where's the nymph?\" he asked.\n\"She, uh, she got away. Sorry.\"\n\"Oh, well,\" he replied with a lopsided smile, \"Jolly good fight. Made the trip worth it. Remind me to mind you more carefully in the future.\"\n\"Sure,\" I told him. \"Why don't we go to dinner, then back to the hotel?\" He nodded in agreement. We changed to our human forms, got dressed, and left the beach.\nI made sure to get him roaring drunk (in the safety of our hotel suite) that night, then got up before dawn while he was still sleeping it off. He hadn't trashed the room too badly; at least everything was still intact, if messy.\nI got to the beach when it was still dark, and sat on the sand, watching the sky, waiting for Nysis.\nDawn came, and with rosy fingers.\nGods, I hate that line. Homer beat it to death in `The Odyssey'.\nIn any case, Nysis climbed out of the water as the sun came up, just as promised, and she did indeed have the sword. She was a slight creature, and had to drag the hunk of metal behind her. I met her halfway and helped her with it. As I pulled off the seaweed tangled around the blade, a warm glow hit our faces.\n\"Isn't it beautiful?\" she breathed. It truly was. The blade was the color of gold, but it was like no other metal I'd ever seen. It was etched with scenes of war, and the hilt was strong and elaborate.\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"I can have it back in a couple of days at the most.\"\n\"You're welcome,\" Nysis replied. \"Just don't lose it. Hephaestus forged it, and he's a friend of Thetis. If anything happens to that blade, you'll have to answer to him.\"\n\"I'll keep it safe,\" I promised.\n\"Um, Thaylos,\" she said after an awkward pause, \"Will I see you again after this?\"\n\"I don't know,\" I replied. \"I usually don't like the cities.\"\n\"The Atlantic has many coasts,\" she smiled.\n\"Yes, but... but after I'm... cured, I may not be like this anymore. I may even go after you when I return the sword.\"\n\"I'll take that chance,\" she told me. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed me on the forehead. \"Good luck, Thaylos.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nI watched as she turned away and went back to the sea. She swam out a bit, waved to me, then disappeared beneath the waves. I sighed, watching the rolling water for a few moments longer, then went back to the hotel.\n\"What's that?\" Euriphides asked me as we headed to the airport, motioning to the wrapped-up sword on my lap.\n\"Oh, nothing,\" I replied, \"Just a souvenir.\"\n\"I've sent word to Aetros,\" Artemis told me later. \"He's going to meet us here later tonight.\"\n\"In the park?\" I asked.\n\"No, but in Pittsburgh.\"\n\"Why?\"\nThe Huntress shrugged. \"I have no idea. But he wants to meet me at one of the local universities, in the Fine Arts building.\"\n\"What did you tell him?\"\n\"I sent word to him that I knew who he was and what he was up to. I made it a little threatening---enough to get him to reply and agree to meet me. I don't think he takes me seriously, though---he seems to think he's something special---which he is, but I think it's gone to his head.\"\n\"Did you get his Thread?\"\nArtemis smiled. \"Right here,\" she said, tapping a bag slung around her shoulder. \"I've never seen a god's Thread before. It's very interesting---and very large.\"\n\"How does it fit in the bag, then?\"\n\"The bag belonged to Perseus,\" the goddess explained. \"It can hold anything. He used it to carry Medusa's head back to King Polydectes. I assume you got the sword?\"\nI unwrapped the blade. \"Right here.\"\n\"Can you wield it?\"\n\"I haven't tried. But I know a little bit about swordplay.\"\n\"You may need that knowledge,\" Artemis told me. I didn't like the way she said it. She took the sword from me and tested its balance. \"Very nice,\" she remarked. \"Athena would appreciate this.\" We were deep in the woods of Schenley park now, and there was a large, dead tree nearby. She went over to it, raised the sword, and sliced through the base of the trunk as if it were air. The tree toppled over, neatly sliced through. I was amazed. Next she shooed me off the rock I was sitting on, and cut through it with almost no effort.\n`But can it still slice a tomato paper-thin?' I mused. \"Do you think it'll cut Aetros' Thread?\"\n\"Quite possibly,\" she replied.\n\"Why don't we just cut it now?\" I asked. \"Why do you have to go meet him?\"\n\"Why do WE have to go meet him,\" she corrected. \"I still need you.\"\n\"But why don't we just kill him now?\"\n\"It's a serious enough thing to kill an eternal,\" Artemis explained. \"To kill a god, especially one as powerful as Aetros, is a very serious matter, not to mention a shame. We'll give him a chance. Maybe if HE'S threatened with death, he'll see the error of his ways and give up. I'd rather have him for an ally than kill him.\"\n\"Judging from what I've seen and from what you've told me,\" I put in, \"He isn't going to change.\"\n\"We'll see,\" the goddess told me, \"We'll see.\"\n\"Are we going to a fraternity party?\" Euriphides asked me.\n\"No,\" I told him for the third time. \"I really don't think you should follow me tonight.\"\n\"Why ever not?\"\n\"I told you, it could be dangerous. Don't you remember what I just told you about Artemis and Aetros and the Threads? How many times do I have to repeat this to you?\"\n\"Oh, stop with that silly story already,\" Euriphides scoffed, \"and tell me truly what you've been doing with Artemis.\"\n\"It's not a story!\" I insisted. \"Minorus is dead! As in gone to Hades! And so is a nymph. This Aetros is capable of dethroning Zeus. He can kill gods and eternals.\"\n\"Oh, come now. Minorus is most certainly not dead. Whatever sickness you have, it's affecting your mind. We'll have to do something about it when you're through with Artemis.\"\nI gave up trying to explain. Euriphides simply wasn't going to accept my story, and I was going to have to deal with it. But I was afraid for him; I didn't want him along. I didn't want him to die.\nAt four in the morning we emerged from Schenley Park and hit Tech Street, behind the academic buildings of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\"Where are all the parties?\" Euriphides asked. \"I don't hear any music.\"\n\"They're all over by now,\" I said, and immediately regretted it. I should have sent him off to the fraternity houses.\n\"Oh, well, I'll stick with you, then,\" Euriphides sighed.\n\"Really, you don't have to,\" I told him. \"I wish you wouldn't.\"\n\"Well, I'm going to. Too bad.\"\nI sighed and led him to the Fine Arts building. It was a large, cream-colored brick structure dating back to the early part of the twentieth century. A good part of the roof was made of strong panels of opaque glass, used to let light into the personal studios during the day. At night the students working would turn the lights on, giving the top of the building a wonderful glow. Tonight, however, only a few lights were on upstairs.\nI led Euriphides down to the basement and changed to my True Form. He followed my example. Next, I took pieces of felt and a bottle of glue from my coat pocket.\n\"What's that for?\" Euriphides asked.\n\"Sh,\" I replied quietly, \"Lower your voice. The floor upstairs is marble, so we don't want anyone to hear us. Glue the felt to your hooves.\"\n\"Ah...\" he said, rubbing his hands together in delight, \"We're going to play a little sneaky-game! Are there nymphs here?\"\n\"No, just a few art students.\" `And a god with a chip on his shoulder...'\n\"They'll do,\" Euriphides replied, flashing one of his wicked smiles.\nI put my hands on his shoulders. \"Look, William---Euriphides. You're going to have to be quiet and do exactly what I say if you want to stay with me. This is serious.\"\n\"Oh, all right. I'll play your little game.\"\n\"'Riph---I mean it. This could be very dangerous.\" I paused. I really hated being sappy, but I couldn't help it. \"Whatever happens, I want you to know that you're my best friend.\" I wanted to say \"I love you\", but I couldn't. I THOUGHT I meant it, but then, I thought I'd loved that peasant girl, too. I wanted to tell Euriphides the truth, not an empty phrase.\nAs I mentioned before, we tend to radiate our emotions, and now was no exception. I think Euriphides felt my thoughts quite keenly that moment; perhaps he almost understood. His smile faded and he looked at me in the oddest way.\n\"Sure, Thaylos,\" he replied quietly, \"You'll always be my little kid.\"\n\"Hey,\" I smiled. \"You got it right for once.\"\nWe glued the felt to our hooves and crept up a small, corner staircase to the main floor. We stayed in the doorway, next to the concert hall and across from the theater, watching the front door. The sword and the bag holding Aetros' Thread were at my side.\n\"What now?\" Euriphides murmured so quietly I barely heard him.\n\"We wait for Artemis,\" I replied, equally low. \"And stop swishing your tail.\" I motioned to him to cease conversation.\nThe main floor of the Fine Arts building was unusually elaborate compared to the studios upstairs: light grey marble floors decorated with abstract, black marble floor plans of buildings like the Parthenon; a huge ceiling, at least thirty feet high, painted with murals; replicas of famous Greek sculptures situated in niches; a bizarre, ominous facade on the entrance to the Dean's office; a few columns here and there for good measure. It was entirely neo-classical, a sharp contrast to the art produced upstairs. I was beginning to understand why Aetros had chosen this place. It was reminiscent of a temple, and probably as big as his ego.\nAt length the front door swung open, and in stepped Artemis. She glanced at me, just long enough to make eye contact, then called out. \"Where are you?\"\nI heard footsteps, then saw a man step out of the shadows. He was tall, with slicked-back, dark hair, wearing a sharp business suit. \"Artemis,\" he said in a deep voice, \"You have the honor of being the first Olympian to behold me.\"\nA look crossed the goddess' face, a look which distinctly said, `I think I'm going to puke.' But it quickly vanished, and was replaced by a smile. \"Yes, I suppose so,\" she replied.\n\"How did you find out about me?\" he asked. \"I've gone unnoticed for a long time.\"\n\"I have my ways,\" she answered. \"Forgive me, but I can't reveal ALL of my powers.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nBeside me, Euriphides put his lips to my ear. \"That man's a god,\" he murmured. I nodded. \"I don't recognize him.\"\n\"That's Aetros,\" I dared to reply, without taking my eyes off the god. \"I told you it wasn't a story.\"\n\"I hate to put this childishly, Aetros,\" Artemis went on, \"But I know who you are and I saw what you did.\"\nHe chuckled. \"Ah, yes. Impressed, are you?\"\n\"Yes. Impressed---and disgusted.\"\n\"Come now... what's a satyr or two?\"\n\"Killing eternals is a serious business,\" Artemis snapped.\nAetros looked her over. \"You're afraid of me, aren't you?\"\n\"Considering Prometheus' prophesy, and the fact that you've killed two eternals without remorse, yes.\"\n\"Let's get to the point,\" Aetros said. \"Why exactly did you want to talk to me? Somehow I don't think it was to slap my hand.\"\n\"You're right. I wanted to talk to you about your plans. It's always a little messy when a new god appears on the scene. I just want to make things easier.\"\nAgain Aetros chuckled. \"My plans? You should know, if you know the prophesy.\"\n\"The prophesy states that Thetis would have a son CAPABLE of overthrowing Zeus. It doesn't say he will.\"\n\"The implications are there. Tell me, Huntress, why shouldn't I fulfill my destiny? Zeus is feeble---he's let the humans degenerate, forfeited to Christianity. He's a disgrace.\"\n\"What's a few thousand years to an immortal?\" Artemis countered. \"I think one day we'll return to glory---and you could be at our side.\"\n\"Well, *I* am impatient,\" Aetros hissed. \"The time for the new order is now, before this world gets any more polluted. The humans were never meant to be here in the first place. Prometheus has a soft spot for them, but I don't.\"\n\"You want to destroy them?\"\n\"It will be over for them quickly. After that, I'm going to cleanse the planet and start over.\"\n\"Let me guess,\" Artemis said in a low voice, \"In your own image.\"\nAetros smiled. \"Very good.\"\n\"And what about Zeus?\"\n\"What about him? I told you, my destiny awaits.\"\n\"I don't know what Thetis has told you all these years,\" said Artemis, \"but destroying Zeus and all the world isn't the answer to your problems.\"\n\"It's my Fate,\" Aetros told her. \"You can't deny Fate.\"\n\"Speaking of which,\" Artemis returned, \"Where are the Fates?\"\n\"Safe.\"\nArtemis studied the young god for quite some time. \"Tell me,\" she said at length, \"Must you destroy Zeus?\"\n\"I must. I have no love for him. He gave my mother nothing but grief. And as I've said, it's my destiny.\"\n\"Are you truly capable of killing him?\"\nAetros flashed a broad grin. He made a motion with his hand, and the air began to shimmer. An instant later, the front hall of the building was filled with a beautiful, intricate rope of a million colors and patterns, glowing with life, floating freely in the air. I tried to find its ends but couldn't. \"There,\" Aetros said, \"You can feel it, can't you? You know who this belongs to.\"\n\"Where did you get that?\" Artemis demanded, but he only smiled. \"Listen to me,\" she went on. \"If you kill Zeus, all the Olympians will come for you, and many of the lesser gods, too. Why risk that? Why destroy yourself?\"\n\"If I can kill Zeus,\" he replied, \"Why should I fear his children?\"\n\"If you don't stop this now,\" the Huntress threatened, \"We'll be forced to destroy you.\" She held out her arms and a siver longbow, nocked with a brilliant arrow, appeared in her hands. \"Please, Aetros,\" she said, her words genuine, \"We'd much rather have you for an ally. Don't make me hurt you.\"\nAetoros laughed hard, his mirth echoing off the stone walls and marble floors. He waved his hand again, and Zeus' Thread disappeared, sent back to where it had come from. \"Are you threatening me?\" he exclaimed. \"You can't hurt me, goddess. Nor can you sway me.\"\n\"We'll see,\" Artemis hissed, and let the arrow fly. Aetros held up his hand in a \"stop\" gesture. The shaft halted in midflight and crumbled away. The Huntress lowered her bow, and it faded out of sight. \"You give me no choice,\" she said, \"I'm going to have to contact the Olympians.\"\n\"They didn't believe you twice,\" Aetros scoffed, \"Do you think they'll believe you a third time?\" He waved his arm again, and another Thread appeared in the hall, woven in silver, gold and green. Artemis gasped. It was her Thread, the Thread of the Goddess of Three Forms, one for the Earth, one for the Moon, and one for the World Below.\n\"They might,\" the goddess choked.\n\"Yes,\" Aetros agreed, taking hold of the Thread, \"They might. You've gone a bit too far, Artemis. I'm afraid I'll have to deal with you... harshly.\" A terrible, closed smile stretched over his face. His body seemed to grow larger and the aura of strength around him began to throb as he began to twist and pull at Artemis' Thread. The goddess gasped, clutched her chest, and fell to her knees.\n`Thaylos!' I heard her anguished cry in my head, but I was terrified, rooted to the spot.\n`Thaylos, please!' I watched as she writhed on the floor, as Aetros pulled her Thread harder and harder, stretching it to its limits.\n`Thaylos, where are you?!'\nI thought hard. I thought about how often I'd become disgusted with the humans, but how many times I'd enjoyed what they had to offer. I thought of all needless slaughters I'd seen---the Inquisition, the Native Americans, the Holocaust. I thought about Minorus and the nymph Aetros had killed, and how he'd arbitrarily played with Euriphides' Thread, considering doing the same to him. I thought of Euriphides, crouched behind me; sincere, eccentric and utterly dippy, but wonderful in his own right, my best friend in all the world.\nI hated Aetros.\nThe feeling radiated from me so strongly the god finally noticed my presence. He turned his head in my direction as I leapt from the stairwell, Achilles' sword in one hand, Perseus' bag in the other.\n\"STOP!\" I shouted.\nHe laughed.\n\"Oh, by my mother,\" he chortled, \"Artemis, what have you lowered yourself to?\" He turned back to me and grinned. \"You think I didn't know what you were up to, you disgusting little satyr? Now put down that sword.\"\n\"They say it'll cut through anything,\" I growled, \"Even you.\"\nHe narrowed his eyes. \"Come here and try,\" he challenged.\n\"I don't have to,\" I told him, and pulled part of his Thread from the bag.\nHis smile only broadened. \"Achilles' sword is powerful, but not that powerful. Perhaps in another god's hands it could harm me. But you---I don't think so.\" He put on a good act, but I could feel his fear. It became clear he wasn't certain what the sword would do. \"Now put the blade down,\" he ordered, tightening his grip on Artemis' Thread, \"Or I'll kill her.\"\n\"You were going to kill her anyway,\" I replied, fuming.\nHe thought for a moment. \"I'll tell you what,\" he said, brightening a bit, \"If you give up this nonsense, I'll let you lie with her before I kill her. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\"\nNow Euriphides may be that stupid, but I'm not. \"Piss off!\"\nAetros' face took on a momentary look of shock at my reply.\nA moment was all I needed.\nI threw Aetros' Thread down on the floor and raised Achilles' sword above my head. My mind was reeling with anger.\n`I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate...'\nI thought of Euriphides again, and then of Aetros.\n`I hate I hate I hate I hate I LOVE I hate...'\nI heard Artemis scream my name---too late.\nA hand closed around my wrist. I was so filled with rage that at first I didn't even feel it, but then it clamped down so hard I heard my wrist break. I let out a shriek. As I spun around to face this new threat I was thrown to the ground. Achilles' sword slipped from my hand and fell with a clatter to the marble floor. I looked up.\n\"You stupid goat,\" growled Euriphides---with Aetros' voice.\n\"'Riph---?!\" I blurted. I quickly looked over my shoulder at Aetros. The god threw back his head in mocking laughter, then faded away like mist. I turned back to Euriphides, wide-eyed and frozen to the spot.\nEuriphides---or the being who I had thought was Euriphides---rippled in the air before me, and his image was replaced with Aetros'. \"I don't seem to have your Thread with me at the moment,\" he said in a deadly tone, \"but I don't think I'll need it.\" He reached down, and before I could snap out of my fear and dodge away, his hands were wrapped around my throat and he was hauling me off the floor. He began to shake me. I panicked and began to thrash; I was so terrified I think I actually bleated. Purely out of instinct, I pulled up my legs as far as I could, and with a choked cry slammed my hooves into him.\nI was quite surprised when they connected with his crotch, not because of where they landed, but because of the effect it had.\nFor all his power, Aetros howled, dropped me, and doubled over, as crumpled and disabled as any mortal man would be. I scrambled across the floor and grabbed Achilles' sword with my good hand. The god's Thread was still laying on the floor. Again I raised the sword above my head, and brought it down with a roar.\n`This is for Minorus, you bastard.'\nThere was an explosion of light and pain, and I thought that was what dying must be like. Everything went black for a bit, and then I heard Artemis calling my name. I opened my eyes and saw her bending over me, looking disheveled and a bit concerned, her hands on her knees.\n\"What happened?\" I croaked.\n\"You did it,\" she informed me with a weak smile, \"You killed him.\"\nI managed to sit up, and from there the goddess helped me to my feet. I looked around. Aetros' Thread was gone, and Achilles' sword was lodged in the floor. Artemis had to pull it out for me.\n\"Euriphides...\" I murmured. I turned to the Huntress. \"Was he Aetros all along?\"\n\"I don't know,\" she replied.\n\"You don't think he killed Euriphides, too?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Artemis repeated.\n\"What will happen to Thetis and Prometheus?\" I asked.\n\"They'll be dealt with. You don't have to worry about them coming after you.\" Artemis heaved a sigh. \"Well,\" she said, \"I believe I owe you something.\"\nI barely heard her as I stared at the sword in my hand. \"What?\"\n\"You wanted to love,\" she reminded me.\nI looked up at her. \"I don't think I'll need your help to achieve that anymore,\" I told her. We stared at each other for a few moments, and then I turned away, heading for the stairwell.\n\"Wait!\" she called after me, \"Where are you going? We still need to find the Fates!\"\n\"Find 'em yourself,\" I growled. \"I've done my good deed for the millenium.\" I tromped down the stairs to the basement, changed back to my human form, and got my clothes on. I tucked Achilles' sword under my coat and headed off into the night, gingerly holding my broken wrist. For some reason I headed toward Forbes Avenue, away from the Schenley Park.\nAs I drew near the fraternity houses on the corner, I saw someone stagger out onto the street. He saw me coming, squinted at me, then yelled, \"Thaylos! Over 'ere!\" and burst into a fit of laughter.\nI didn't recognize the face, but I knew the voice, and as I drew near, I caught the familiar, musky smell. \"Euriphides?\" I called back.\nHe stumbled up to me. \"You look horrible, my dear boy,\" he said, and giggled again. \"I went to the park to look for you,\" he explained, \"but you weren't around, so I went to the parties without you. Jolly good time. Completely makes up for that fiasco in New York.\" He flashed me a lopsided grin and threw an arm around my shoulder. \"Why don't we celebrate having so much fun by having more fun?\" he asked. \"Let's go back to that lovely Japanese restaraunt.\"\n\"Chinese,\" I corrected, and laughed. I patted the sword resting under my coat. \"Maybe later,\" I told him. \"Right now I have to return a sword to a certain nymph I know.\"\nFaye Levine is a Sophomore Illustration major at Carnegie Mellon University.

The ambassador himself had vetoed that solution, claiming his absence would serve his enemies as well as his death. Therefore, Richard was hardly surprised when a team of armed guards appeared and began frisking members of the crowd, directing them to another building after the short but thorough search. The crowd complained; Richard didn't. His weapon would not be found by a search. A guard frisked him and found only some change in his pocket, and a camera. The camera the guard took from him, mechanically informing him that he could recover it at such and such a time at such and such a place. Richard ignored him under a facade of listening intently. His camera did not concern him, since he could obtain another almost at a thought, and the change the guard considered harmless lay in his pocket. It was still there when the guard motioned him toward the building. Richard thanked him and moved to the door.\n``Name?'' asked a still another guard at the door. The guard carried only a clipboard and pen in his hands, but two pistols were holstered at his side, and his face said that he wouldn't hesitate to use them.\n``Richard Johnson.'' It was a statement of fact, as though it were the name he was born with. It wasn't. Richard wore his name like an old jacket, comfortably, but it was easily discarded for a new one if necessary.\nHe stepped through the door and into a large hall. The crowd that had come to hear the ambassador speak wasn't much of a crowd. Only a few hundred people dared risk the public threats of violence, and there was a distinct air of nervousness about those who were present. In an attempt to dispell this fear, or perhaps to increase it, the khaki-camouflage uniforms of the guards were present everywhere among the crowd and in the balconies of the building. Richard's impression was that the guards outnumbered the spectators; certainly the numbers were close. The security was as much a relief to Richard as it was to the ambassador inside; he was no more immune to stray bullets than other men.\nA man appeared on the platform and began to speak. Richard was attentive for only a moment; he was not the ambassador. The speaker's eloquent introduction went unheard; a soft buzz at the edge of Richard's hearing had attracted his attention. The man on the platform spoke for several seconds more, then stopped, a puzzled look on his face. As the sound became clearer, the droning of plane engines approaching, he went white. His hands gestured frantically, motioning the people in the hall to the floor. Some obeyed, others ran for the door, oblivious to placing themselves in the crossfire. Richard hesitated a moment, then chose the group running for the door. He listened for the sound of artillery before exiting, but the planes were still too far away.\nThe planes were in fact just becoming visible. It was obvious from the faces of the guards that they should not have been there. Richard didn't want them there either. Somewhere in Richard's childhood, he had found an ability none of his friends shared. He called upon it now. A darkness filled his mind, formed by his thoughts and framed in light. Carefully, he placed the darkness over the image of the planes in his mind. With a twist of his mind, the planes and darkness switched places. The darkness he dropped, the planes he hurled to a position hundreds of miles away beneath the surface of the Pacific.\nWhere the planes had been now stood only empty space. A rumble of thunder rolled over the spectators as the air rushed in to occupy it. In that place, the planes may never have existed, but a few hundred miles away a brief flash of light signalled their destruction as they appeared under water moving at some thousand miles an hour.\nFor several moments the spectators continued to stare at the sky, until in a slowly growing patter of speech they began to speculate on what had just occurred. Richard used the time to return to the chaos of the hall. He sat down and waited, relating the events outside to group of bewildered spectators who had remained inside.\nEventually the old man returned to his introduction. After several minutes, he stepped aside. The spectators began to clap. The ambassador appeared on the stage, bowed in recognition of the applause, and began to speak. Richard listened, feeling respect for the man on the stage and what he stood for, almost a twinge of regret.\nFinally, he reached into his pocket and drew out the handful of change. Richard selected the heaviest coin from the bunch, and let the rest slide back into his pocket. Prepared earlier, this particular coin contained enough cyanide powder to kill a couple of horses. Richard waited until the speech neared its end, then teleported the contents of the coin directly into the ambassador's body. This time, there was no thunder. Instead, the coin collapsed in on itself as it's interior became a vacuum. Richard let the coin drop to the ground. The ambassador himself took no notice of the new substances even now rushing through his body, nor would he for some hours, which would give Richard plenty of time to get out of South America. His speech ending, the ambassador's last words were drowned in applause. He smiled, bowed again, and left.\nThe clapping died and the spectators were led out. Richard took the provided bus back to the heat-infested mire that served as a city in this part of the world, and walked to the airport. An hour after the speech he was on his way back home.\nRichard walked in the front door of a small office building, barely glancing at the faded sign that read ``Eidel Distributors.'' Within was a sparsely furnished office, its walls covered with pictures of athletes that Richard did not recognize. The photographs were yellowed with age, and the years had taken their toll as well on the wooden desk that occupied the center of the room. Contrasting the room was a young man seated behind the desk. He looked up as Richard entered, then nodded and pointed to the only other exit from the room, a beaten-up wooden door bearing an unreadable nameplate. ``They're waiting for you, Mr. Johnson.'' Richard nodded back and smiled, but his mind had clicked on the word ``they.'' His business should have been with Eidel alone. Nothing in the young secretary's voice had signalled danger, but Richard was used to working with men like Eidel, and caution never hurt. Carefully, he opened the door. Beyond the door the appearance of the office changed. The walls here were mirror-bright steel, and a heavy steel door on the other side of the small antechamber guarded Eidel himself. A small screen was set into one wall. Richard went up to it, and punched the attention button. A moment later the screen lit up to display a stern man sitting behind a mahogany desk in an elegant office. Two other men sat on a couch behind him, but moved to get out of the view of the camera almost immediately. Richard didn't like the way they looked. ``Mr. Eidel,'' Richard said softly, ``I believe a mutual acquaintance of ours died last evening, as we discussed? I've come to pay my respects.''\nThe face in the screen did it's best to give a warm smile. It looked rather hideous, but Richard was searching it for things other than comeliness. He found nothing, but hadn't expected to. Briefly, he glanced at the light on the steel door. It remained dark; he was safe for a time. More than long enough. ``Indeed,'' Eidel replied. ``Which entitles you to a payment of three million dollars, which I have here. Come in; the punch code for the door is 65537.'' The screen went blank, but not before Richard saw him glance quickly at something offscreen, next to the door.\nThe punch code clinched it. Eidel could open the inner door from the desk inside, without effort. No need to have Richard do it.\nRichard smiled slightly and left through the same door he had come in. Positioning himself against the wall beside it, he summoned a mental image of the inner steel door. With a twist of thought, he teleported it into the front office. A brilliant flash of light rolled over him, and the sound of thunder filled the office. The secretary looked up, then dove under the desk as a sound of gunfire filled the back room. Richard, too, moved behind the desk and waited. In a few moments, the two gunman stepped through the door into the front office. Richard teleported them, naked, about seven blocks away. Bending, he grabbed one of the fallen machine guns and teleported himself into Eidel's office, his finger lightly on the trigger. ``Good day, Mr. Eidel,'' he said smoothly as the thunder rolled away. ``As I believe I told you when we met, I am very good at what I do. And for my services in removing those two pests from your office, my rate just went up to six million. The remodeling is free.'' Richard fixed Eidel with a meaningful stare.\nEidel had been in business long enough to know when he was beaten. He slid a suitcase across the desk to the Richard. ``There's only three million there. I'll have to get the rest from the vault tomorrow.''\nRichard waved his hand dismissingly. ``Don't bother. I'll help myself.'' He wouldn't, he knew, since money wasn't a problem for him and he didn't know where Eidel's vaults were located. Still, he appreciated the look of terror that crossed Eidel's face for the merest of moments before the businesslike exterior covered it completely again. Eidel had just witnessed two of his men defeated by this unarmed hitman, and Richard appearing in his office in a flash of thunder and light. Eidel despised theatrics, but Richard was obviously dangerous. Richard turned and walked out of the office, and Eidel did nothing to stop him.\nOutside, Richard stumbled and fell twice before managing to flag down a cab. The driver awoke him at his destination, then stared speechlessly at the two bills that Richard handed him. Moving slowly and deliberately toward his house, Richard decided the effort wasn't worth it. Exhausted with the effort of teleportation, he collapsed on the front lawn. It was several hours before he began to dream the awful nightmares of his power.\nA knock on his door startled him. There had been none for several years, save the occasional minister or salesman, and it was too late in the evening for that. Richard frowned, turned off the stove under the soup he was cooking, and went to the door. Just as he reached it there came a second, more insistent knock.\n``Open up in there. Police!''\nRichard opened the door. Outside, two guns were facing him, held by a couple of uniformed police officers. Behind these officers stood about a dozen more, and several police cars were lined up along the long driveway to his house. ``Richard Johnson?''\nRichard nodded absently, thinking.\n``You're under arrest for murder. You have the right to remain silent.''\nRichard shrugged. He had been arrested before, several times. There was nothing that they could do to him if he did not resist. Prison, even a death sentence, meant nothing to him. He could escape with a thought. Better to let the process run its course. Richard put his hands above his head and let himself be led away. The trial was over quickly. Richard had an impressive record of prison escapes, and so was convicted and sentenced to several life sentences without the prosecution even having to bring up murder. In fact, Richard never discovered which murder he was arrested for. In his mind, it didn't matter. The judge was particularly aware of his prison breakout record, and ordered him into maximum security. Richard grinned as he heard it; no prison could contain him. He was led away under heavy guard. He awoke at midnight of his first night at prison and waited for the guard to pass. Stepping to the back wall, he twisted himself to a pre-selected spot about three quarters of a mile away, then lay there panting, regaining his breath after the teleport. If anyone on the nearby road had seen the flash of light which announced his arrival, they ignored it. After a short interval, he began walking toward the city, following the road a safe distance to the side. Several hours brought him back to freedom. He could not return to his house, but he had other houses and other names in other cities. No one stopped him as he entered the airport and boarded a plane, and the security guards watching for him in the airport noted nothing unusual that night. A sound of thunder was passed off as the rumble of a departing jet.\nRichard stepped out of the elevator on the thirty-third floor of an impressive office building, and introduced himself to the receptionist at the desk. She looked him over carefully, almost critically. Apparently he passed the examination, because she pointed toward a heavy wooden door with the name ``Emily Brandon'' in raised while letters on it, and spoke precisely. ``Through there.''\nRichard smiled at her and opened the door. The plush office on the other side of the door was occupied mostly by a huge desk and some chairs. A middle-aged woman sat behind the desk. She smiled and looked up as he entered.\n``Good day sir. What can I do for you?'' She stood and extended her hand. Richard pointedly ignored it, and helped himself to a seat. Emily Brandon remained standing as he spoke. ``You `advertised' for a bit of extermination work, I believe? The rates quoted to me were quite high.'' She met his eyes. ``Important target, and difficult to find unguarded. Name's Dinash. Edgar Dinash. You know him?'' Richard nodded, but looked away from the scrutinizing eyes. ``Television producer. New York, I believe? Shouldn't be any problem.''\nShe held up a hand.\n``Not quite so easy. I also need certain documents that are in his posession returned to me, and they need to be returned before he dies. I don't want them found by people looking through his personal effects.'' She paused. ``I will pay you ten million dollars, half in advance.'' She opened her desk, pulled out a key, tossed it to Richard. ``That will open a safety deposit box at the address listed on it. One million will be placed there each workday next week. You start next Saturday, not before. Agreed?''\nRichard stood up and dropped the key on her desk. ``I never take payment in advance. I will recognize these documents when I find them?'' Her need was plain to him; he met her eyes again, this time with cold superiority.\nShe nodded.\n``I'll see you in two weeks, then.'' Richard opened the door, looked back over his shoulder once, then left. The receptionist smiled at him as he re-entered the elevator. The doors slid closed with a soft click.\nTeletrix\nMartin Kendall sat down at his kitchen table, and slid one of the two mugs of coffee he carried to his wife. Smiling, she accepted it, and pushed a small plate of rolls to him, then waited expectantly. Kendall selected one, buttered it, then put it down and looked at his wife. June continued to look at him expectantly. Kendall scratched his head and frowned contemplatively. Eventually he gave up. ``Yes, Mrs. Kendall?'' They had not been married long enough that the name had lost its strangeness, and he liked it's sound. ``The paper?''\n``Ah, yes,'' Kendall's smile returned. ``I knew I forgot something.''\nThe morning paper appeared silently on the kitchen table, mere inches in front of his wife's plate. She jumped, then narrowed her eyes at him across the table.\n``One of these days I'm going to get used to that,'' she said accusingly. Kendall just smiled back at her. Lowering her eyes, June took the paper and opened it, and Kendall returned to his breakfast. June read for several minutes in silence, then pulled a single page free from the paper, folded it to highlight a single article, and handed it to him. Kendall wiped his chin and accepted the offered paper. The article in question was immediately interesting to him. ``..whose real name is still unknown, escaped again from the maximum security installation. This escape marks the eleventh known breakout of his career, all by unknown means. Johnson was stripped of his clothes and all possessions, and thoroughly searched by prison personnel before admittance. The door to his cell was still locked, and there were no signs anywhere of a forced exit. Police are completely baffled. One officer commented to us: ``Until I saw it today, I would have claimed that it was completely impossible.'' This breakout marks the first one at the prison in eight years, since ...'' Kendall nodded. ``He's a teletrix. No doubt about it.'' ``What are you going to do? He's known to have killed over two dozen people. The man's a professional assassin. Who knows how many more they just haven't caught him on?'' Kendall threw up his hands. ``What can you do about a Teletrix? If you catch him, he teleports away. You can't even kill him unless you manage to surprise him, and in his profession that's difficult to do. You can hardly hunt down a man with that ability.''\nHis wife continued to stare at him silently. He resisted as long as he could, then nodded guiltily. ``You're right, of course. I can't just let him go on killing people. The academy, I'm sure, won't release their records, so I'll have to find him myself. Would you call the office for me? I'm going to be out of state for a while.'' ``You call the office,'' June said firmly. ``I need to change. I'm going with you, of course.'' Kendall's face registered surprise briefly. ``Of course,'' he echoed. June smiled and Kendall shook his head slowly. He rose from the table and made his phone call, then got dressed. By the time he had returned to the kitchen, June had put the breakfast dishes in the dishwasher. She kissed him once. ``Where are we going?''\nKendall had worked it out while dressing. ``The prison. I need a better picture of him than that newspaper photo, and maybe an address. The police will have searched his house, of course, but at least it's a start.''\nKendall closed his eyes, and the yellow lines of a shimmering grid filled his mind. He selected a location, envisioned it, and was there, so smoothly that his wife didn't even stumble. They stood on a roadway beside a lighted ``STATE PRISON'' sign, out of sight of the main gates. Kendall let go of his wife and the two travellers set off down the road, closing the distance to the entrance in a couple of minutes. A guard stuck his head out at their approach, lifted his eyebrows questioningly.\n``Visitors,'' Kendall said. ``We're here to see the warden.'' The guard nodded, ``just a minute.'' Moments later, a second guard arrived, searched them, and led them to tidy office with the name ``Tim Gardener'' on the brass doorplate.\n``Please, have a seat,'' the guard requested. ``Mr. Gardener isn't in yet this morning, but he should be here in a few minutes. There's coffee and maybe even some donuts in the next room.'' He pointed to a door, then turned and left. It was almost a half an hour before the warden walked through the door. He was somewhat of a heavy man, with a face lined from too many years at his job. He extended his hand to Kendall, then June. Both took it silently. The warden seated himself behind his desk, and lifted a pair of glasses to his face. ``How may I help you folks?''\n``My name is Martin Kendall; this is my wife June. We're private investigators. We'd like a look at Richard Johnson's file, if we may.'' From his shirt Kendall produced an ancient private investigator's license that he had gone through some trouble to obtain several years before. Cautiously, to keep it from falling apart, he handed it to the warden. The warden examined it for a few moments, handed it back to Kendall, then walked into a back room. When he returned about two minutes later, he carried a manilla folder.\n``Here it is, a heavy one, too.'' He handed the folder to June, and sat down again. ``If you don't mind my asking, who hired you for this? I wasn't aware that there was a private party interested in Johnson's case.'' His voice betrayed a little more interest than the words. Kendall wasn't surprised; prison breakouts didn't happen all that often, especially ones as smooth as this one. Kendall smiled winningly. ``Actually, we're not currently working for anyone. This is sort of a personal thing. Richard Johnson is big news right now. If I can catch him, it will be great for my business.'' The warden smiled. ``I don't really approve of your motives, but I'd be happy to get Johnson back in my hands. I'd love to see him escape from our underground solitary confinement cells! The next time we catch him, we're going to keep him.'' ``I'm sure you will,'' Kendall lied. June had finished copying down something from the folder. She passed it to Kendall, open to Richard Johnson's prison pictures. He noted it carefully, then glanced over the other pages. ``You've got his address?'' June nodded.\nKendall closed the folder and handed it back to the warden. ``Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Gardener.'' The warden didn't lose his smile. ``Good Luck. If you find any leads, though, don't forget to report them to the police. And be careful - Richard Gardener is a murderer, and a cold one at that.''\nKendall nodded. ``We will.''\nRichard looked up from the pile of papers he was reading when he heard the click of a key in the lock. He stuffed the papers back into the drawer, as dishevelled as he had found them, and teleported back to his hotel room with a sound of thunder and a flash of light.\nOnce there, he ordered a sandwich from room service and lay down on the bed to think. All of the obvious places to look for Dinash's documents had failed to reveal any interesting ones. Mostly, the man seemed to collect only contracts of various television personalities, and a few letters from exotic countries that Richard had never even killed anyone in. His safe contained money and jewels, which interested Richard not at all, and the safety deposit box at his bank contained only his will. Richard was running out of places to look.\nBut he wasn't running out of time. It was still three days before he was even supposed to be on the job, and he couldn't kill Dinash before then. If he could find the documents early, recovery later would be easy, but he had little else to do. As a last resort, Dinash could be tortured into revealing their location, but such actions weren't really to Richard's liking. A knock on the door announced the arrival of his sandwich. Richard paid the bellhop, tipping him with a hundred-dollar bill, and sat back to eat. There were still a couple of places he could look, but they could wait until the following evening. He finished the sandwich and turned out the light.\nThe house was surrounded by a fence and a locked gate, but it posed little problem to Kendall. Still legally owned by Johnson, it was not for sale, but neither had any upkeep been done on it in some weeks. The front door was unlocked, so Kendall and June slipped inside, closing it quietly behind them. The house had been searched by the police, but the two investigators went over it equally carefully. Except for a pot of soup moulding on the stove, the house contained little of interest. No documents in the house had been spared by the police. Kendall disposed of the soup, then joined his wife at the table.\n``Well, where do we go from here? He could be almost anyplace.''\nJune shrugged resignedly. ``I guess he'll have to show up someplace.'' She drummed her fingers on the table absentmindedly, staring at one wall of the kitchen. Suddenly, she got up and left the room, Kendall staring questioningly after her. She reappeared a moment later, smiling. ``Martin! There's another room here! Look.'' She indicated the back wall of the kitchen. ``There's no doors leading in there, but that's not the back wall of the house, either. There must be about a ten foot space behind that wall.'' ``How come the police didn't find it?'' ``They might have looked for a secret room, but one without doors? What's more useless than a room without doors?'' Kendall smiled. ``Not useless to a Teletrix, of course. You're a genius.''\nShe took the praise silently, then made a gesture of impatience. ``Well, are we going in?'' Kendall shook his head. ``I'm not going to TP us into an area that I can't see. Let's bring whatever's in there out to us.'' He stepped back and cleared an area in the kitchen. A moment later a suitcase appeared in it, covered by a pile of loose bills.\nJune's eyes widened. ``There must be a million dollars there.''\nKendall squinted at it expertly. ``Closer to a hundred million. Richard is a rich Teletrix. Take some.'' He bent down and opened the suitcase. Inside was more money, which Kendall ignored. On the inside top of the suitcase was a small engraved plate, which read Antosh Eidel. Beneath it was an address. ``Bingo.'' Kendall said.\nThe night watchman looked his way again. Richard was getting a bit tired of avoiding the man's view, so he teleported him down thirteen stories, then remained motionless for a minute or so to be sure that the thunder didn't attract anyone's attention. It didn't. He walked down the hallway to the office which read Edgar Dinash, and teleported himself inside. Again, we waited until the thunder in the hall died down. Still, no footsteps could be heard. He panted quietly from exertion, then looked around.\nOnly one of the drawers in Dinash's desk was locked, so Richard started there. All he found were life insurance policies and contracts for a couple of very big television names. Cursing, he opened the other desk drawers. None contained the information he was looking for, but if the insurance policies were all valid, Dinash's family would be very rich in a few days. Richard sat back in the chair and put his feet on the desk. The office was twenty stories in the air, and probably expensive for that reason alone, but was relatively sparsely finished. Around the room were photographs of various actors in roles that Dinash had apparently cast them for, including one large framed one of an actress that Richard did not recognize, her face not particularly pretty or memorable. It didn't feel right. He stood up and went to the wall where the picture hung, and lifted it carefully down. Behind it lay the gleaming steel of an expensive wall safe. Protection against nearly any device man could invent, it took Richard a mere fraction of a second to defeat it and lay its contents out on the desk. He read a few sentences at the top of the documents and smiled; there was no doubt that this was what he had been looking for. He looked at his watch. It was just after midnight, so today was Friday. By noon on Saturday, Edgar Dinash would be dead.\nThe elevator door opened, and a receptionist looked up brightly at Martin Kendall. He looked back without a trace of warmth, his eyes daring her to comment. ``Thank you, but I know the way.'' He turned toward the office door.\n``You can't go in there right now, sir. Ms. Brandon is busy.''\n``No she's not,'' Kendall smiled menacingly, and opened the door.\nEmily Brandon looked up from her desk at the intrusion, and the beginning of an angry comment came to her lips. When she saw Kendall's face, she stopped.\n``Where is Richard Johnson?'' he demanded. ``I've never heard of any Richard Johnson,'' Emily said quietly. ``I think you should leave this office before I notify security.'' She reached toward an intercom on her desk, but it vanished before her hand contacted it. She stared at the empty space in disbelief. Kendall stretched his smile still further. ``I received your name from a Mr. Eidel, Ms. Brandon. He seemed quite confident that you know where Richard Johnson is. Seems he recommended him to you for a little job you need done. A very illegal job.''\n``You have no proof of anything, and I don't know who Richard Johnson is.''\nKendall shrugged. ``I don't need to offer you proof, Ms. Brandon. I have something far more valuable to you.'' A moment later the office had vanished, to be replaced by the windy building roof. Emily Brandon found herself looking over the edge of her skyscraper, forty stories to the ground. She shook her head violently. Kendall sat next to her on the ledge. ``I assure you that this is not a dream, Ms. Brandon. Where is Richard Johnson?''\n``I don't have to tell you anything. My receptionist saw you come into the office. You'll be found and locked away for murder if you kill me.''\n``Suit yourself,'' Kendall said just loudly enough to be heard over the wind. He gave her a gentle push, toppling her over the edge of the building. There was silence for a moment as she grabbed for a hold, then a drawn out scream as she tumbled over and over away from the building.\nKendall watched, let her fall almost a dozen stories, then teleported her back to the roof, carefully cancelling her velocity. Emily Brandon lay in a barely conscious heap on the top of her building.\n``Where is Richard Johnson?'' Kendall repeated. ``New York City,'' she said breathlessly, wide-eyed. ``He's there to kill Edgar Dinash.''\n``And when's the hit supposed to be?'' ``Saturday.''\n``Where?''\n``I don't know. Honest to god I don't know.'' Kendall nodded. ``Ms. Brandon, the information you have given me had better be accurate.'' A moment later, he vanished. Emily Brandon lay sobbing on the roof of the building for almost an hour before she made her way slowly back to her office. On the first floor, Kendall came out of the men's room. June looked up from the magazine she was reading. ``Well, did she tell you where he is?'' Kendall nodded. ``Yep. She fell for the idea right away.'' June shivered.\nEndgame\nEdgar Dinash found a couple of visitors on his doorstep when he arrived home Friday evening. There was no obvious explanation for how they had gotten there, past the electrified fence and the two guards, and neither the visitors nor the guards seemed inclined to offer any. One of the intruders stepped forward and offered his hand. Edgar ignored it.\n``This is private property and you're not invited guests. Please leave these premises at once.''\nHe was ignored in turn. ``My name is Martin Kendall, and this is my wife, June Kendall. We're private investigators, and we have reason to believe that your life is in serious danger. May we come in?''\nDinash considered. ``Guards!'' he called finally. ``Make sure that they don't have any weapons on them, then let them in.'' He waited until the guards had frisked them, then opened the door for them. Together, the three of them stepped into Dinash's home.\n``Explain yourselves,'' he said simply, and gestured toward several plush chairs sitting around the room. Kendall and his wife sat. June spoke. ``We have reason to believe that a contract on your life has been put out by an Emily Brandon.''\nKendall saw the look of interest come onto Dinash's face. Not surprise, just interest.\n``It's very possible. She and I don't see quite eye to eye.'' June nodded. ``In any event, the hit is supposed to be sometime tomorrow. We don't know when, but the man who is supposed to do it is extremely effective. Your guards won't be any good against him.''\n``So what do you suggest I do?''\n``Take a vacation in the city. Go to a cheap hotel, register under a false name, take your guards with you. Leave us and the police to handle this man at your house.'' Edgar Dinash looked up at one of his guards, suspicion plainly evident in his face. The guard shook his head, however. ``No, they are really legit. I had their licences checked out. They're in good standing, and it's certainly a believable story they have. You should have seen how they got in here. I think we should do it.''\nDinash turned back to June. ``I had the feeling when I got up this morning that it was going to be one of those days. Okay, I'll leave for tomorrow. But if this house is damaged, or anything is missing . . .''\nKendall raised his hands. ``Then you have our names and current addresses from our licence. You really have nothing to lose.''\nDinash remained silent.\nRichard looked at his watch. Midnight. Teleporting the materials out of the safe once more, he packed them carefully in his briefcase and returned to his hotel room. There he changed clothes and packed his bags. Downstairs, he hailed a cab and was back on the streets.\nMinutes later, he was in the back yard of Edgar Dinash's house. He looked up to the upstairs bedroom window, where a light still shone. Richard settled back to wait. There was no rush, now, and everything to be gained by waiting until Dinash was asleep. An hour went by, as other lights in the house turned on and off. Eventually, the bedroom light went out. Still he waited, as another long hour crept by. Then he stood slowly and approached the back door. Richard knew from previous exploration of this house that there was a security alarm on the door. Stepping back, he teleported to the other side. Upstairs, a sound of thunder caused June to look up suddenly from the chair on which she sat. Kendall moved quietly to the window, looked out at the sky, and frowned. A thoughtful look came over his face.\nA slight noise came from downstairs. Kendall gestured for June to remain where she was, and teleported himself silently to the other side of the bedroom door.\nRichard moved as carefully as he could across the sunken living room, but he bumped one of the tables even so. The vase that was on it did not tip, only slide slightly. He paused, but heard no sound above. After a few seconds, he began his slow march across the living room again.\nHe was not prepared for the light to come on. The blinding illumination was not enough to hide the man who stood against the opposite wall of the room, but Richard just stared and shook his head for a second or so.\n``Hello, Richard,'' Kendall said. ``I've been waiting for you.''\nKendall was dressed in nothing but a loose robe, and his hands were empty. Richard made a decision quickly, and drew his long knife from his belt. Holding it in his hand, his mind twisted it into Kendall's chest.\nNothing happened. Kendall noted the effort but descended into the living room without comment. Richard looked at the knife in disbelief, and tried again. Kendall sat down. ``You can't kill Edgar Dinash, Richard. I won't let you. Even a Teletrix will have some difficulty killing him where I've put him.''\nThe battle began and ended in an instant. Kendall tapped a grid of energy, Richard gathered energy from within himself. In a single instant, Richard vanished, and Kendall's mind snapped out toward him.\nA sound of thunder filled the room, and a scream of agony came from outside the walls of Edgar Dinash's house. The upstairs door opened and June came running down the stairs. The first thing she saw when she reached the bottom was the bloody lump that lay in the center of the carpet. The second thing she saw was Kendall.\nHe was sitting in the chair with a look of shock on his face. When his wife sat next to him, he looked up with a kind of pity in his eyes.\n``Thunder,'' he said quietly, carefully. ``The air filling in the space he vacates when he teleports. There's probably a flash of light at the other end to disperse the energy.'' June looked at him. ``So?''\n``He's an amateur, not a Teletrix. The academy somehow never found him.'' Kendall fixed her with a stare. ``He's never been trained in using a grid. Odds are he's teleporting on his own energy; he must have incredible endurance. Certainly he doesn't know how to protect himself.'' Kendall pointed toward the center of the room. ``That's his hand. I teleported it off of him as he was leaving.''\nHe stood up. ``We had the advantage of surprise, and now I blew it. He'll be prepared the second time. We need to find him, and kill him.'' Kendall hugged his wife. ``And soon. Or he'll keep on killing.''\nRichard pushed the darkness from his mind and regained consciousness in a hospital bed. Gently, he examined his arm. The bleeding had stopped, and the flesh at the end had been sewn together, leaving a battered stump; there was no feeling at all in it. On his other arm, blood flowed into him from an I.V. unit.\nShaking his head carefully, he pulled the needle from his arm and sat up. He had lost a lot of blood, but he was still alive, and needed to get out of here before his enemy found him if he wanted to stay that way. Richard sat for several minutes, then stood up slowly, leaning on the bed for support and waiting until the darkness in his head receeded once more. Moving to the window, he looked out. Across the street he could see a fast food restaurant. Summoning all the energy he had in him, he teleported there in a flash of light and thunder. Kendall heard the thunder just as he reached the door of the hospital room. He cursed softly under his breath as he opened the door.\n``Missed him. But he can't have gone far.'' With June, he crossed to the window on the other side of the room. All of New York twinkled in front of him, a thousand lights on a city that could hide a million men.\n``Far enough, though,'' he concluded.\nRichard looked at the ad again. It read, quite simply:\nRICHARD JOHNSON, I WILL BE ON TRAIN NINE OF THE SUBWAY SYSTEM AT EXACTLY NOON ON THURSDAY. WE CAN NEGOTIATE THERE. THE TRAIN IS NOT RUNNING, NO ONE ELSE WILL BE PRESENT. -- EDGAR DINASH\nFor the hundredth time in as many hours, Richard lifted the stump of his left arm and looked for his watch, the pang of loss cutting deep into him as he realized his error and looked at his other wrist. The time was eleven thirty, fully a half an hour before the meeting. He felt as though there were only a half an hour left of his life.\nClearly, the message was the bait to a trap. But a strange, new man had entered Richard's life, the only person in the world who he could fear. Until one or the other of them was dead, Richard would never be safe, never be confident that his power was unique and able to pull him out of any situation. He would always feel hunted. This message might be the only chance he ever had to win the battle. Looking for a long moment at the stump of his arm, Richard knew that he would win. And the man had given Richard knowledge. The trick, of preventing the teleportation of Richard's knife into the other man's body, was not very difficult; all it took was for Richard to know it was possible, and the solution almost immediately presented itself. Mainly, it was a process of continually teleporting oneself to the same spot, preventing intrusion of foreign matter into it. The process was exhausting, but Richard could now do it for almost a minute at a time. He should be safe as long as he didn't take chances.\nAs the appointed hour approached, some spectators appeared, the inevitable result of the meeting's public announcement. Richard told them to leave, quietly at first and then emphatically as some of them began to argue with him. After two of the men identified themselves as also having the name Richard Johnson, Richard got fed up and teleported them to the sidewalk above. None returned.\nRichard checked his watch again, felt a wave of confidence as he unconsciously picked the correct wrist. Five minutes to noon; time to move. He twisted his mind and body, filling the silent subway train with a roar of thunder.\nTwo people were already inside the train car when he arrived. One was the man he had met in the living room of Dinash's house, the other a young woman that he did not recognize. Neither appeared concerned at the method of his arrival. Both were seated on low benches. The windows were covered with heavy black plastic sheets, probably to prevent outsiders from observing their conversation. The only light in the car came from two electric lamps sitting on the floor. Richard stood firm and gazed at them for a few moments, his newly learned shield operating at its fullest potential. ``You said something about negotiating?'' he asked, not wanting the shield's implied time limit to show in his face or voice.\nKendall nodded. ``What will it take to get you off of Edgar Dinash's tail?''\nObviously there really was some negotiating to be done. The trap was baited neatly, if it really was a trap. Perhaps they simply feared him and wanted a way out. Richard seated himself on a bench and looked at Kendall.\n``More than you can pay. I don't back out on a job. I never have.''\nFar away there came the sound of an approaching train. Kendall opened his hands in a friendly gesture. ``We can pay a substantial amount, Mr. Johnson. More than you might imagine. In fact, enough to make you quite comfortable for the rest of your life.''\n``You don't understand. Money is not the object. If I want money, show me any bank in the world which can prevent my taking it. I have been contracted to kill Mr. Dinash, and I will. I won't be bought out.''\nThe distant train drew closer.\n``How much will it take to make sure you never kill again? We can't stop you, the best we can do is pay you to keep the peace.''\nRichard smiled. ``You can't.'' He was beginning to enjoy the game, but equally aware that his shield time was running out. At best, he had another three quarters of a minute, less than that if he didn't want to totally exhaust himself. The rumble of the train began to pass them, shaking their car. Kendall smiled ever so slightly, and made two small adjustments to reality. The bench that Richard was sitting on vanished silently. In his sudden fall, Richard did not notice the slight change in the noise, the minor differences in the shaking. Richard looked at Kendall in surprise. ``You did that silently.''\n``Of course. You abuse your ability by using it as a weapon, Richard. You force people like me to hunt you down.'' Kendall was more powerful than Richard realized. And his words implied that there were others like him in the world. Suddenly, he felt less confident about the interview, but didn't let it show.\n``Hunt me? You can't touch me any more than the police can. Just because you know of my ability and understand it doesn't mean you can stop it.''\nKendall's smile vanished. ``Your arm, I believe, is testimony that I can indeed hurt you. That could have been your heart. Next time it will be.''\nRichard smiled broadly. ``But you can't do it again, thanks to a trick you yourself showed me. No, I think you probably have the most to lose from a showdown.'' He drew a knife from his belt, calm again.\nKendall looked at it uncertainly. ``You know that that won't hurt me.''\nRichard smiled. ``No, but it will hurt her.'' He gestured toward June, and the movement made him aware how much energy he was losing. He could only stay a few more seconds. The knife vanished from Richard's hand, appeared in Kendall's. ``No, it won't. I can protect her as easily as myself. And do you trust your protection enough to challenge me? I think we have nothing more to say.''\nThe train car still shook with the rumble like the passing of a train.\nRichard nodded. ``Indeed. Except this: Edgar Dinash is a dead man.'' He turned away from Kendall, twisted energy in his mind. A roll of thunder filled the car, echoing. Kendall cringed briefly in sympathetic pain, then sat down and hugged his wife.\n``He got away again,'' she said simply, sympathy in her voice. ``No, he didn't.'' With an offhand gesture he teleported the curtains off of the windows, allowed her to see out. ``We're moving,'' she commented.\n``Absolutely. I started us when the other train went by. TP is wonderful for avoiding such nusciances as acceleration. The shaking isn't the other train, it's us.'' ``But so what?''\n``Richard Johnson didn't understand his power. He never used the grid for energy or direction, or enough air would have been shifted back from his destination to fill the gap he left. But he couldn't have known that, or there wouldn't have been so much thunder when he teleported. He wasn't aware that we were moving, so when he left, he wouldn't know to bleed off the excess velocity. Wherever he went, he was stationary with respect to the train. To the rest of the world, he was moving at 120 miles an hour. I just hope he didn't hurt anyone as he died.''\n``Are you sure he's dead?'' June said softly.\n``Completely. And you will be, too, if you watch the news this evening. `Man smeared on pavement'. I'm sure it will be a top story.'' Kendall didn't sound happy about it, only resigned. He stood looking out the window of the train for a long time, searching for something in the blurring buildings. He stopped the train, returned it to the station, derailed but functional. An instant later they were in their own kitchen.\n``I think I need a good nap,'' Martin Kendall said.\nChristopher Kempke is a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University.

Tilenius\nCopyright (c) 1987\nTom sat, admiring the craft, and contemplating. His thoughts\nwere as big as the craft was small, his plans for it as enormous\nas its interior was cramped. This was no ordinary craft. It\nwas the craft that would forever kick Him -- not God, for to Tom\nthere was no such being, but Him -- out of his place in the sky.\nHe broke the bottle of champagne and dubbed the machine ``The\nMissionary.''\nThe long years before had taken their toll on Tom. Tremendous pressures, numerous disasters, and emotional stress. As he stared at the peanut butter sandwich that lay half-eaten on his workbench, its light brown wheat crust flaking onto the floor in small dry pieces, he recalled how his wife and family -- oh, but how he had loved them! -- had left him, with Mary calling him an ignorant self-righteous zealot. It had hurt, but he would never turn back. All the wars, all the strife, all the killing in the name of religion would cease. He would prove it wrong. ``You persist still?'' The voice came from Minister Sol, who had entered into the room, his trim black outfit moving only as it was hit by the silver cross which dangled from his neck. Sol, taking his golden pocket watch of which he was so proud from his side, exclaimed, ``My InfoLink said your call was urgent, so I came right over. I do hope I am still in time? I take it this is not for dinner.''\nAs Sol finished, and slid his pocket watch delicately back into its place on his side, he surveyed the room. It was quite different from when he had been here last, a scant year ago. Amid the old fashioned tools lying scattered around the workbench were some new higher-technology devices. The floor was spotless, though, and clear, except for the highly visible object in the center.\n``By the Lord,'' started Sol, ``What is this monster? You can't be serious! I do hope you plan on moving it soon!'' For the first time in what seemed like ages, Tom was about to speak, to truly speak. He had been alone for such a long time, he hardly seemed to know how to speak at first, but such a task was made easier now that he saw his old friend again. It had been ages since he had seen Sol last, but it always brought a gleam into Tom's eyes to see him. Sol and Tom had been excellent friends back in high school, a friendship strengthened by their diametrically opposite views on practically everything under the sun. They would spend countless hours debating, and Tom had listened to many a ``sermon'' from Sol. But, invariably, their thoughts would return to the one topic that seemed to most separate them -- whether God existed. Back then, Tom had put forth an argument that had society not been brought up on the Bible, and taught it by others in society, man would not know about any supreme deity, and thus it would be unnatural to assume one existed. ``Say you were raised in the backlands,'' he had argued, ``and no one ever told you about Jesus or Moses or Mohammed. What then? You'd likely grow up believing a different myth, a different explanation of how things work. The only reason so many people believe is because they've been told 'this is true' or 'that is true'. What would rationally define a deity? Your background. And there's nothing to prove otherwise.''\nSol, never one to let another get the better of him, had countered, ``But there have been proofs! And signs! God sent Jesus into the world that we could see what is true. Living proof, that died for you, Tom, yet you refuse to accept it!'' And so it went. Tom would never accept it. Nor did he think others should. It was blind, heathen mythology. Others never accepted Tom. He was the heathen, and suffered. A scar on his hand where Mary had slammed the door bore proof of this. ``I must go about the business of stopping all this madness,'' he had told her in one of his more passionate moments. ``Look at all the ills because people are deceiving themselves! If they would realize their situation and better it. But no -- deception, and willfully so.'' She had kicked him out, screamed at him. And he had wandered, hungry.\nFinally, he met up with Lucy. Beautiful, rich, popular Lucy. She seemed to just have everything, yet even when he saw her first, he had felt the deep insecurity, the questioning, the vulnerability. It had been on one of his reflective journeys, visiting the Grand Canyon on the little funds he had left. They had been talking, looking out over the edge, when Lucy had told him about the great confusion inside her. ``Somehow, Tom, I feel I can talk to you about this. I usually can't stand to bring it up, it torments me. No, don't ask me what -- I'll get to it. Really, I've made up my mind that I will tell someone. Oh, you'll probably think me silly and all, but... look out there.''\nShe pointed out across to the richly colored, jagged canyon wall, sparkling in the late day sun that was just beginning to set. The clear afternoon breeze ruffled her fine hair and blew some of it up against the deep blue sky. A bird, flying overhead, piped out the most beautiful song as Lucy's trembling hand pointed to a flowering bush in the distance. Tom, in jeans and a sweater, merely looked and said nothing. ``It's all so lovely, Tom. It couldn't have happened all by chance, now, could it? I was raised in a strict background, taught that God made everything. Sometimes, like today, I can almost see that, yet most of the time I'm so unsure. It's such a material world, how can we say that God exists? Are we looking at a proof here, Tom, or an accident?'' The man in jeans paused, looked out over the canyon, and spoke to the woman who would be his benefactor for the next hellish, in the mythological sense, years of his life. ``Neither. It's nature. It is, beautiful, but not because some unseen power has made it so. Nature, life, is naturally beautiful. It needs no outside force. Who would have thought 100 years ago that we would have accomplished the things we did? We must let go of these myths and be free to grow even more.'' Lucy looked uncertainly at Tom, as though she wanted to find that he was telling the answer. ``I'm so afraid when people start talking about religion and beliefs and all that. They debate them, and discuss them, and defend them. But when they come to asking what mine are, I shrink from it, seek any desperate plot to change the conversation.'' Here she looked imploringly at Tom, as if not to force her into a similar situation, and continued, ``How can I defend mine when I'm not even sure what mine are? It seems that everyone but me believes in something, even you. I can't defend my thoughts against belief. God, Tom, if only I could know.'' That, of course, was when it all happened. The crazy scheme of Tom's unfolded, and Lucy grabbed at it like a baby grabs for its pacifier. Lucy would have her proof, and Tom would finally prove to all the world the lunacy of all these myths. So, today, when Tom kneeled by the machine in front of Sol, he felt as though he had rehearsed for the moment for ages. The seclusion, the pain, the criticisms, the government condemnation of his project which had forced him, with Lucy's help, to bring it underground were all about to pay off. He spoke. ``Yes, Sol. This machine will move. It will move itself, and in doing so, move mountains of 'faith'. For tomorrow both of us, and my benefactor, and the whole rest of the world will have proof that the Bible is nothing more than a story --- or any other document.''\n``What the hell are you saying?'' cried Sol, now becoming a bit more excited, ``Does it test the air for proof of God? What devilish plot have you cooked up to despoil the name of the Lord now?''\nTom rose, and looked at his friend's flushed face. ``Nothing of the sort. It's a time machine.''\n``Now you're really loony! Nuts! Is Lucifer growing inside you? You know that's physically impossible. It would create infinite paradox. You just can't go and change the past!'' A grin crossed over Tom's face, and such a grin it was that one would very likely have thought him devil-ridden, if one were so inclined. His composure soon returned, though. ``It can't change the past, Sol. But it will let you see it. Any place, any time is there for the observation. We can see, now, the whole tale -- of how the Bible was fabricated, written; how the tales of your favorite `hero' Jesus came into being.'' ``You're mad,'' Sol repeated, dumfounded. He fingered his watch nervously, silvering an already worn area in the gold covering. His blackish hair seemed to stick up at a higher angle than before, and the white roots near his scalp became slightly visible, as though someone had planted white-hair seeds their and they were just beginning to sprout.\nBut there was to be no doubt. The machine worked. Tom showed Sol how the mytronic crystal had to be twisted to energize it, after which a tremendously precise time\/place indicator could be set to see anywhere, any time. ``Once there, you can get out and walk around, but you won't be physically there -- anything that touches you will go right through you. You are an observer only, they can't see you and you can't effect them. It's about the closest to a god you'll get.''\nAnd observe they did, Sol and Tom. Taking turns testing the machine in the near past, for only one could fit in the machine at a time. One stood on the podium as Lincoln gave the Gettysburg address, the other jumped in the way of the bullet at Reagan's assassination. They saw all, and affected nothing. Hours later, they decided to call it a day. ``You see, Sol, tomorrow, I will go and get pictures, evidence that your God exists only in people's mind, now as then.'' Sol, who seemed a bit whiter despite his obvious excitement with the technology, merely said, ``It will change nothing. You cannot shake what people believe. They will never believe you. And, what if you discover Jesus, preaching, what then?'' ``I won't. Of that I am certain. And I will bring evidence.''\nWith that, the two friends went to bed. Oh, what a changed world it would be in the 'morrow. Neither of them slept well, and Sol was up most of the night, moving around restlessly. Tom tossed like a child before Christmas, eagerly waiting to open the present which had been hoped for all year. It was decided that Tom should go first in the tiny machine. He took with him a camera and tape recorder, and entered the craft, shutting Sol and the rest of the world outside, and entering his own little universe inside. He carefully adjusted the dials, and pressed the button to start. The world went black. A faint acrid odor permeated the chamber, and Tom went faint for what must have been half a minute or so. But when he recovered, he was there. He shakily, rose and lifted the latch of the door.\nWhat he discovered outside was a completely different world. An arid climate, with sand, a few trees and bushes, people in biblical dress. Damn, but he would prove this his point now! Camera and audiocorder in hand, he set forward, traversing this land. How he longed to talk with these people, to ask them if they had ever heard of Jesus! To track down the lye to its origin! But, how?\nAs he was deeply engaged in thinking about this, his feet moving over the sand and over a rise almost by themselves, he saw up ahead a crowd of people, gathered around a figure who was standing on a small rock and looking around them -- a meeting! Here, Tom might pick up some dialogue that would aid him in his quest.\nBut as he approached, something inside him began nagging, bugging him. That childish superstition that comes to any man when entering a dark cellar and causes great anxiety, even though the man knows there to be no monsters lurking in that darkness. So, too, something ate at Tom now. Could it be that... He put the thought out of his mind -- he had always had an overactive imagination.\nBut the feeling would not go away. As he came closer, he made out that the central figure had a beard, and a rather holy, commanding appearance. ``A leader, preaching,'' thought Tom, ``there is nothing unusual in that. Perhaps he even tells the story of Jesus to those who suck it in.'' So, Tom walked up to listen.\nStraining to make out the foreign tongue, which was actually easier than Tom had expected, he heard the bearded one speak, and promptly froze. The words could hardly have made a more chilling impression if they had ordered his very death. ``The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of all seeds: but, when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.'' The bearded one held up a handful of the fine mustard seeds, and scattered them for all to see. For a moment, Tom stood, stunned beyond belief. Then he regained composure -- how silly it was, to assume that there would be no religious preaching. There always had been, and this was no exception. False ``religious'' teachings had made up the Bible, had they not? He was getting jumpy.\nHis thoughts raced on ahead of him, trying desperately to overcome the surge of anxiety that was overcoming him. But now the nagging had turned into full scale fear, washing over him as the storm did the disciples before Jesus had quieted -- but NO! There WAS NO SUCH PERSON! Or, he was blown out of proportion, if he existed -- he couldn't have...\nThere, in front of his eyes, a cripple walked towards the bearded one. Tom dropped his camera. He wanted to run, to cry out, to yell. His whole life, the pain, the suffering, his conviction, the scar on his hand, Mary! The bearded one bent down and spoke to the cripple. This time Tom yelled. He was sorry, but he couldn't help it -- he just couldn't. This wasn't happening! God, his life, please, God it wasn't all wrong, no, it just wasn't.\nAs though J--- the bearded one had heard his cry, he turned, and looked right into Tom's eyes in such a knowing glance that Tom felt his soul being read. Every facet, every crime, every treacherous statement was known. At that instant, the cripple was made whole.\nBetter than Tom had taken the cripple's place than for this. For now, God, what had he done! A revolting heave came to his stomach, and he found himself unable to keep his breakfast down. He passed out moments later, lying in the pool of his own vomit. When he awoke God knows how much later, he could hardly walk. The cracked camera that lay by his side, the camera that sought to disprove the face of God, was stained in vomit. No one else was around. Dizzily, he staggered back to his time machine, and wrenched himself inside and barely managed to hit the return button before passing out again.\nThe immediacy of his panic had left him when he regained consciousness. It was now more a sense that an inadvertent murderer would have after recovering from the initial shock of killing a man, and now wanting to hide the evidence. Tom's mind worked furiously, and his body quicker. He wrenched himself outside into his lab, and grabbing a stick of explosive, hurled it into the machine as he dragged himself away. Moments later, a blast rocked the lab as the machine sat smoking. As the shock waves wore down, the faint rumblings of a truck pulling away could be heard in the distance. Sol came running in, and looked at the smoking mess, and his war-torn friend. ``Sol,'' Tom gasped, ``help me, please.'' ``What on earth happened?'' the other asked, coming over and embracing Tom. Tom, events, images, his whole life reeling through his head tried to get the words out, but couldn't. Now that he knew, he KNEW the truth, he had to tell it, didn't he? But to give in? To admit complete defeat? To admit that his whole life had been decadence and sin? He had to beg forgiveness to Jesus, to God, to...\n``Ship,'' he groaned, pained -- yet how much less than the pain Christ suffered on the cross! -- ``can't go that far back in time. Explosion.''\nTom slumped, then blacked out again for the unbearable torment. To have lied on top of everything when God was looking on!\nSol held him for a moment, and ascertaining that his friend was unconscious again, gave a brief frown and brushed a mustard seed from his debating partner's sleeve. ``It seems we have both lost today, Tom... You see,'' he addressed the unconscious one, ``I set you up. I couldn't trust your machine. I shorted it out. I hired actors. I... I was afraid of what the truth might be as much as you were.'' Sol ripped the silver cross off his neck and placed it firmly in Tom's hand. ``You are me now,'' he wept, ``and I you.''\nEric W. Tilenius is a Senior majoring in Economics at Princeton University.

She spurted from her mother's body into a sea of gray, lit from above by the twin moons of Daddy's eyes as the crashing surf of the shortwave radio echoed throughout the enclosure. Six months later baby Patty had spit out her first solid food, a dark gray wafer that had been pushed into her mouth by her mother's pinkish-gray hands. The brick of protein landed softly on the cold concrete floor Patty called ``ground.'' Four years had passed since Patty asked her mother what dying meant. Three had passed since Patty asked Daddy what ``cancer'' meant.\nPatty was six when Daddy explained to her that the red-eyed cyclops she had feared since she could remember was really a radiation meter. She had learned to read it by the time she was seven.\nDaddy had a little surprise in store for Patty on her eighth birthday. He went to the back of the shelter and brought out his dull silver box that had never made anything but hissing noises. On this special day, the silver box spoke. It said, ``Hello, Patty, how are you on this fine day?'' Daddy nodded and smiled at Patty. ``I'm fine,'' she said with a shaky voice. ``Who are you?''\n``I'm a friend of your father,'' the box voice said. ``Why haven't you said anything to us before?'' Patty asked with a scolding tone. ``We've been here together and you've never done anything but..'' she paused to think, and then made a hissing noise.\nThe box's voice seemed apologetic. ``Maybe your father should explain to you. I'm sure I'll see you later. Goodbye, Patty.'' The box hissed for a moment and then fell silent. Patty hissed back at it.\nDaddy explained that the outside world had allowed them to talk to other people in other places through the box. He also told her that soon, they would be able to leave their home and venture above.\n``Of course, it will be hard work at first,'' he said with a smile, ``but in return for that work, we'll be able to run free, look up at the sun during the day and the stars at night, and eat real food.''\nThat night, before she fell asleep, Patty stared up at her flat sky, the dark ceiling, and wondered what Daddy meant by ``outside.''\nFive months before her ninth birthday, Daddy opened the doors that led outside. At the end of the long, sloping hallway would be a hatch to the surface.\n``Do you have everything, Patty?'' Her father wore a heavy jacket and backpack. ``Once we start going, we can't come back for more.''\nPatty pulled on the parka that her mother once wore and zipped it. It was far too large for her, but it would have to do. She nodded and picked up a bag filled with her things. Daddy started up the passage. Patty followed, leaving behind the only place she had ever known. When they reached the end of the passage, Daddy turned a crank a few times and then pushed up on a small hatch above them. It popped open, and Patty saw the sky for the first time.\nPatty climbed out of the passage and into the world above as Daddy stood and stared at the horizon. As far as he could see, the ground was dark gray, covered with a mixture of snow, ash, and dirt.\nHe turned to look at the sky, yearning to find a blue ocean with small puffy clouds, and instead found a dark overcast covering the world. There were no cars, no houses, no roads, no plants. There was nothing but a gray sky looking down on a gray world.\nThe world above seemed like a larger version of Patty's world below. She couldn't understand why Daddy had collapsed in tears in the soft ashen snow.\nThe vintage Jeep that was once the pride and joy of a young Douglas Earnshaw was now the property of the Eastern Valley Commune. When the commune set out the share of gasoline to be give to transportation, it was immediately poured in a container and given to Transportation Director Earnshaw, who would unceremoniously drop it in the Jeep's tank. In the commune, possessions dictated social status. Earnshaw was moderately respected, mostly because he owned the Jeep and the shortwave radio. So when he had come into contact with a man who had been hidden away in a shelter for almost nine years, he took it upon himself to bring the man and his daughter into the commune.\nDoug Earnshaw saw the commune as a large rabbit hole in the center of a network of tunnels. It was, after all, planned by a group of survivalists to be the last refuge when the end of the world came. Occasionally, at the outskirts of the tunnel system, would come individuals who had hidden out by themselves. The commune knew they were there, but none had enough foresight to survive the cold or radiation of above and maintain a radio to open contact when the radiation level went down. None except for Mark Olsen and his daughter Patty. How a man could survive and keep a child alive for nine years under such circumstances was incomprehensible. The man's initiative would be a valuable addition to the commune, and if either he or his daughter were fertile, their genes would be just as vital. So Transportation Director Earnshaw found himself behind the wheel of his friend the Jeep, sliding over the snow, ash, and wet dirt, moving toward a hole where two people had spent nine years. Earnshaw didn't see the two until he was almost upon them. A large figure kneeled in the muck, while a smaller one stood beside it. The larger one glanced up, and the tear-filled eyes of Mark Olsen stared in at Earnshaw. He was almost invisible, his pasty skin blending in with the pale world around them. Doug Earnshaw got out of the Jeep and prepared to help Olsen up and into the back. As he turned toward him, though, he stopped at the small figure of Olsen's daughter. Earnshaw gasped in horror as he stared into the eyes of Patty Olsen. She stared through Doug Earnshaw with a distance that chilled his soul, her gray eyes telegraphing a loneliness that he could not begin to comprehend.\n``I don't understand it, Doug,'' a seventeen year old Patricia Olsen said with tears in her eyes, ``he just doesn't seem to care anymore. He lies in bed and cries about the colors, the sky, flowers, things like that. It's like he doesn't want to go on.'' Doug Earnshaw tried to comfort Patty the best he could, but feared it was not good enough. Consoling her was difficult, though, because he avoided looking directly at her. She wasn't ugly, only plain, but he avoided the eyes of anyone under twenty years old. The children's eyes never locked in one place. They always seemed to look through him, gray pools staring out to the horizon. He had known Patty over eight years, but still couldn't bear it.\n``Patty, you can't understand what your father feels. We all feel it, those of us who knew life before... this.'' He gestured around at the dull metal and plastic that surrounded him. ``Your father is worse than most, but he was in that shelter of yours for all that time. I guess he expected the world to be normal when he got out. I don't know if it will ever be.''\nPatty nodded, tried to stifle a sob, and hugged the man who was like a second father to her. When she tried to look him straight in the eye, though, he turned away from her. Mark Olsen's death was not an easy one. He clutched at his faded floral print bedsheets, a pink froth around his lips giving a faint reminder of how the flowers on the deathbed had once looked. Patty was at his side in the last moment, when the darkness of the world that he had known in passing for eighteen years fully revealed itself.\nThe first full-scale outdoor harvest took place as Commune Director Doug Earnshaw stretched out in his bed and prepared to die. He had lived a long life, and under his direction the commune began to return to the agricultural ways of the past. On the day he woke up and knew he would never wake up again, he called for Patty Olsen.\nShe came with her two children. They waited by the door as she entered the room and stood at the foot of Earnshaw's bed. ``I'm glad you came, Patty.'' He took one glance at her and closed his eyes. ``I have one thing to say to you before I die. It's about what your father died looking for.'' ``Looking for?''\n``Colors, Patty. The colors of the world around us. Something you've never experienced as we old-timers once did. But we've begun to plant, Patty. The first harvest is going on as we speak. The skies have finally cleared. Life is resuming, Patty. The world is showing itself in a way you've never seen before. The world has ceased to be gray-on-gray. Appreciate what your father could not, Patty. Do you understand?'' She swallowed. ``Yes.''\n``Good.'' He nodded and turned away. Patty took her two children and left Doug Earnshaw's house and began to walk toward the main street in the town that was what the commune had become. Outside of town, the crops were being harvested. Flowers bloomed on either side of the walkway from Earnshaw's house.\n``Mommy, what did Mister Earnshaw mean about `colors'?'' asked the oldest of her two boys.\nShe stared into his gray eyes for a moment, and then shook her head.\n``I don't know,'' she said.\nJason Snell is a sophomore at U.C.

A chilly breeze swept its way over the waters and along the damp beach, quietly winding its way through the little used barbecue pits past a long, wooden pier, and then withdrew back out to sea.\nBright beams of sunlight danced across the eastern horizon as the coastal palm trees cut the early summer winds into multiple streams of cool jet and spray and the light into stark showers of silver and scarlet.\nMichael Harrison walked barefoot along the shifting earth that divides land and sea. The ankles of his patched worktrousers skidded into the cold waters as he made his way home. The thin blue fabric of a wet dress shirt stretched down his muscular frame to near his knees. His mind pulsated with an overflowing emptiness; thoughts doubled back upon themselves, twisting and turning with the cold waves, drifting against the overwhelming tide.\nHe slowly turned and walked up the whitish sands climbing a thin railed stairway in contest with gravity. The thick wooden doors were already open, and entering, he stumbled in between the white walls of his beach home searching for the null-tube. The entire structure seemed to wobble slowly around him. Squinting between the specks of salt and sand which stung his eyes, he grabbed one wall with his right hand, keeping the left stiffly extended in case he should find another. Suddenly, the room turned sharply, and an invisible foot kicked his legs out from under him. A pleasant softness enveloped his senses as he rolled up warm and passed out cold.\n\"Michael...\"\nHe awoke to a calm feminine voice. Kitara? Still sleepdazed, his bloodshot eyes roamed the room.\n\"Why am I on the floor?\" he mumbled.\n\"Because that is where you retired for the...\"\nMike groaned as he sat upright hearing the now familiar voice. \"I was just talking to myself. You know Cindy, you don't have to...\" Mike's voice drifted off as he slowly realized he was talking to his home's computer system. Her voice circuits paused momentarily waiting for him to continue as he masaged his numb arm.\n\"Talking to oneself is a sign of mental collapse... Mr. Linden is on line one.\"\nHis boss. Mike slumped back on the floor and closed his eyes. \"I'm too tired, tell him to fuck off.\"\nCindy paused for analysis. Mike heard a quiet buzz and a voice, \"Hello... Mike?\"\n\"No Mr. Linden. This is Cindy again. Mike said he was tired and he told me to tell you to...\"\n\"Stop!\" Mike's voice echoed around the entire house. Cindy's voice promptly cut off transmission. \"Cut off the video unit and transfer the line... voice only... to this room.\"\nMr. Linden's voice broke over the speakers, \"... there? Hello? Cindy, I didn't get that?\"\nMike sat up again and rubbed his eyes, \"Chuck, Mike here...\"\n\"Hi, Mike? How's it going?\"\n\"Great... What's up?\"\n\"Well, I've got a gentleman over here from the board who'd like to congratulate you on your last piece. I told him I didn't know whether or not you'd be in today, so he suggested I call. How'd you like to come over and lunch with us?\"\nMike paused, \"Sure, you two gonna be in the Gee-Pee?\"\n\"Yeah, he's checking out our facilities, and he really wants to meet you.\"\nIt suddenly occured to Mike that he should feel flattered. He rubbed the back of his neck and tilted his head sideways until the spine popped.\n\"Ok. I'll be over in... how's three cents sound?\"\n\"Sounds great.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"Okay, thanks. We'll see you then.\"\n\"Bye.\"\nLine one closed with a short breaker. A computer a thousand kilometers away had already multiplied the duration of the call by its distance and tolled Chuck's fund. Mike wondered what the editor wanted.\nThe warm shower spray dissolved the dirt and sweat in no time, and Mike put on a blue mendwear dress shirt, white gelknicks, and a pair of light gravboots. He combed his long, thin, brown hair and tied it in the back. In a few minutes he was in the pantry searching for the standard grub. Picking up a flimsy and light pen he headed back to the living room and straightening his shirt stepped down the stairs into the street.\nThe sun was at high-noon, and the short walk to the subway entrance proved uneventful. There was the usual strain of gravcars and flycycles lined along the beachway, and the hundreds of floaters sailing above the coast made a moving polkadot design of shadows along the sands, but there was nothing unusual in the way the tourists eyed Mike over as if he were a specimen at an alien exhibit. Being the only decently dressed person within several kilometers he walked with a pretended importance, as if he owned the entire beach and could toss them all off at the snap of a finger. He grinned at the thought as he coasted down the escalator at the subway entrance.\nShowing his all-month pass, he headed past security and straight to the terminal. The gravbuses entered and left the port in perfect succession; and within two minutes his bus had arrived. He boarded and easily found a seat. An old lady eyed him from across the car, and a handsome couple with kids quarreled over where to eat. He sat back and looked out the window. His hangover was nearly unnoticeable, and he rubbed his arm where Cindy had indubitably injected him with the get-well juice.\nThe train rose above the surface and fell again to catch another station more inland, the sudden shift from daylight to fluorescence leaving the passengers momentarily blind as their eyes adjusted to the rhythmic tempo of the passing cold lanterns. Two young men entered as the doors opened, their faces twisted in consternation as each tried to make his point more loudly than the other. They fell silent as they headed toward the back of the car, the second's long, bony finger still pointed in exaggerated certainty.\nThe train started rolling again, and this time quickened its pace for some time before eventually rising to the surface. Out the window Silver-Tri-Towers stood as a testament to the might of man. Its arms branching from the main structure reached near the clouds, and the top of the structure blurred with the refraction of light against the atmosphere. The couple's children rushed to the window and pressed their noses against its surface leaving little spots of dense fog on the layered plastic.\nThe train lost speed and dipped under the surface to stop. The old lady got off and the two young men quietly resumed their discussion. The couple sat quietly, and one of their children asked when they would get to eat.\nSoon the train was off again, and as it rose above the surface the kids resumed their former positions at the window, panting puppy dogs with eyes bent skyward. The train turned toward the structure, dipped below the surface, and accelerated. It pulled into a large underground station. Mike quickly exited as a car load of people pressed in.\nHe made his way through the crowds to a lift. Dozens of people entered as the doors closed against the stragglers. The lift stopped on several floors, picking up and dropping off people along the way, until it reached public floor 872, and Mike stepped off. A short walk through the busy halls led him to the Gee-Pee. Mike peeked between the columns and spotted Linden talking with an elderly gentleman and a young woman over three highbowls of zardocha.\nMike held his position and studied the trio. His boss, the section's copy-editor, was putting on a smiley-face for his administrative counterparts. His small body wrapped itself into a tangled web of false composure, as a dim fluorescent beam caught his olive brown face, receding hairline, and large brown eyes at just the right angle to make Mike wish he'd been carrying his trusty camera.\nThe gentleman sitting across from the editor was well known to many in the press office. He had a reputation as somebody who could pull stings, and his white hair and often brittle manner did little to detract from his prestige. Just the opposite, they served to make him appear more distinguished. Mike had seen his picture a dozen times and fit together a dozen odd facts in his mind about the man, but he couldn't connect a name to the face.\nThe lady caught Mike's attention. She seemed strangely familiar. Aside from being simply a woman, her long blonde hair, tan skin, and lithe figure made her appearance incredibly attractive. She sipped her drink carefully, letting the ice flakes clink against the inside of her highbowl as she watched the two men talk.\nThe chatter from the rest of the room blurred together with their own conversation so well that Mike had trouble picking out specific words. He watched Linden's face. The editor looked like he was geared into brag-mode. The other two listened with facinated expressions.\nMike slipped his consumer card through the scanner as he entered the room. Linden noticed him immediately and motioned him over.\n\"Well speak of the devil; Michael, this is Mr. John Clay from the company board, and his niece Miss Robin Clay.\"\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you Mr. Harrison. Charles has just been telling us a great deal about your work.\"\n\"Does that mean I get a raise?\"\nThey all laughed, especially Robin. She seemed to have a special twinkle in her eyes as if there were a secret she wanted to tell him. Her eyes captivated Mike. They were deep sea blue, or maybe sky blue; he couldn't decide. They weren't too dark or too light. Must be implants, Mike thought as he shook off the fascination.\nThen Robin extended her golden tanned arm as if she wanted it to be either kissed from pinky to armpit or broken in half at the elbow. Deciding on the third alternative, Mike extended his own arm in response, and with a smile he shook her hand. It was an archiac gesture to be sure, but one still used among gatherers.\nMichael sat in the empty chair across from Robin. A fourth highbowl filled with zardocha dropped from overhead and floated in front of Mike. He tested it and sent it aside with a gentle nudge. The dark liquorice cafe stung his taste with its frigid strength.\n\"We were actually thinking along the lines of a different sort of compensation.\"\n\"Mr. Clay, I was joking.\"\n\"Within every joke, there must be an element of truth. Without it, the joke isn't funny.\"\nMike smiled, \"Okay, get to the point.\"\n\"Michael, we at the Board of Galactic Press & Publications have been watching this division for a number of years. Your rapid progress and personal achievements have not gone unnoticed by the administration. Granted, there have been pieces of your research, some quite extraordinary pieces of information gathering, which were never published... with good reason.\"\n\"I'm sure.\" Mike echoed.\n\"You, perhaps more than any other gatherer within the sector, understands that we are much more than a news source, and that our gatherers are much more than reporters. They're investigators, they're a form of police, they go into situations where they often risk life and limb.\"\n\"The point.\"\n\"Well, it's actually somewhat stale. I hope you're not offended, but we'd like to hold an awards' banquet for the division as a whole. Just something to boost morale, and to recognize a job well done.\"\nMike sipped the zardocha and glanced sideways at Linden. The editor smiled back; his cajoling face Mike thought.\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"Well, as one of the key figures... as the key figure in your division's success I should say, we'd like you to speak at the ceremony.\"\nLinden beamed, \"You have become somewhat of a celebrity Mike.\"\nMike floated the highbowl in front of his chin, spinning in with one finger to quicken the fluid.\n\"I'm honored... but I wouldn't know what to say.\"\n\"What, with all your experience, with all the various worlds you've visited, not to mention those you've infiltrated,\" Clay laughed at his own joke, \"I'm sure you could think of something to say.\"\n\"I really doubt it, sir.\"\nClay smiled, but Mike sensed something in the older man's eyes that told him to reconsider.\n\"Michael, Charles here has already hinted to me that you might feel this way, and in your shoes, I might feel the same. After all, a gatherer needs a certain amount of anonymity in order to be effective... and just considering what a high profile you have been earning lately... how long do you really think you can keep it up?\"\n\"I really haven't thought about it, sir,\" he lied.\n\"Well, perhaps you should really think about it. This banquet isn't just to fill space and give our people something to do and be happy about. It's opportunity time. An opportunity for us to examine our talent, to redefine our direction, to recruit new prospects into the hierarchy... Charles tells me that you dislike social functions. Is that true, Michael?\"\n\"That would depend.\"\n\"On what?\"\n\"On what's in it for me.\"\nClay paused dumbfounded and then suddenly burst out laughing. Charles and Robin chimed in as if on cue, but Mike was sure he felt someone kick him under the table.\n\"Shy, Mr. Harrison, you're not.\"\nLinden set the floating highbowl down on the table. He looked a little tired and annoyed.\n\"Mike, what Mr. Clay is saying is that you've done a good job, but that with the success you're losing your value as a gatherer. It's time to step up the ladder.\"\n\"You mean behind a desk.\"\n\"Mr. Harrison,\" Robin spoke for the first time in the conversation, \"if you were more valuable behind a desk than in the field, where would you rather be?\"\n\"I'm still pulling my own weight.\"\n\"You and who's army?\"\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"Okay, ask yourself this. How much of your gathering in the field is physically carried out by a third party? If your answer is more than half, then you already over the hill, and half way down the other side.\"\nClay coughed, \"Take care with the metaphors, my dear. Mr. Harrison, forgive my niece, but we understand you've been training a number of research assistants?\"\n\"I'm not going to take a job training gatherers. I've got enough of that already.\"\n\"We're not asking for that. We are simply proving a point, that your useful life is swiftly coming to a close unless you change your field of endeavor.\"\n\"I couldn't be an administrator, and I know I couldn't edit.\" Clay smiled, this time genuinely Mike thought.\n\"You'll be surprised at what you can do when opportunity beckons. Isn't that right Charles? Why, we ourselves are living examples. You think, Mr. Harrison, that your editor was born behind the desk, flimsy in hand? He started just like you. But we all must move on. The banquet is in three days. Yes, it's honoring the anniversary of the founding. It will be at the Lion's Den in GreenFlower. Everything has already been set up, the promotion has already been released in this morning's update, and all you have to do is be there and say a few words to entertain the masses, rub a few noses, and... and pretend that you're having fun.\"\nMr. Clay stood up and grimmaced at the inside of his wrist. The timepiece implant seemed to tell him he was late. He shot Mike a departing glance, \"Then we'll see you at the Banquet, Mr. Harrison... Mr. Linden.\"\nMike stood up, \"Will your niece be there?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Then I won't,\" Mike felt like saying.\nMiss Clay shook his hand in a comfortable contrast to the trial run. For the second time during the encounter she spoke, \"Will you sit by me at the Banquet, Mr. Harrison? I am very much interested in your work.\"\nMike grinned, \"I really don't have a choice about this, do I?\"\n\"Not if you know what's good for you.\"\nMike paused and tried to recall the question. He decided later that it was her blue eyes that made him give in so easily.\n\"I'd be delighted, Miss Clay. If you would like, stop by my house, and I can show you a few items of the trade.\"\nShe smiled, or perhaps blushed. \"I might take you up on that. Where do you live?\"\nMr. Clay conveniently interrupted, \"Come now dear, we must be off.\"\nMike defused the interception, \"Sector E-12, 81152 Beach Boulevard.\"\nShe smiled apologetically as her uncle grabbed her arm and led her out the door.\nWhen Mike turned around, Linden was looking a little angry.\n\"What?\" Mike asked defensively.\nLinden turned away and then tried to keep from laughing. \"Nothing. Just...\"\n\"Just what?\"\n\"Just don't blow it, Harrison.\" Linden was smiling.\nMike smiled back, and they laughed. Everything was still okay.\nMike returned to the house. He recalled that he hadn't seen the morning update, but then he had no will to hear, see, smell, or otherwise comprehend what one dull reporter considered news. He entered the bathroom and relieved himself of the last night's merrymaking. The medical scanner's blue light twirled about until it found and homed in on Mike. He knew Cindy was conducting an analysis. Just as long as she kept to herself about it.\nHe strolled into his room and sat back on the circular bed. The entire chamber glimmered with an eerie, dim blue light. An opaque window on the wall farthest from the door kept out sunlight and the bothersome noises of modern civilization. He relaxed a bit on the edge of the bed and gathered his senses. A shimmering multicolored light on the controller wall betrayed Cindy's presence.\n\"What is it?\"\nIt blinked and moved to the center of the wall. \"What is what, Michael?\"\nHe frowned. Computers weren't supposed to answer questions with questions. \"What are you doing in my room?\"\nThe light blinked a few times. \"I work here.\" Her feminine voice was as matter-of-fact as ever he knew it to be.\nHe decided to beat her at her own game rather than simply getting frustrated. \"Obviously you work here. Please allow me to rephrase myself. Why don't you switch off?\"\n\"Would you like me to switch off?\"\nShe did it again. He contemplated servicing the system by hand with a laser rifle but quickly decided against it. \"No. You're too hard to deal with right now. Switch to lower brain mode.\"\n\"Done,\" the response was instantaneous.\nFrom there he decided to do a little learning as long as Cindy's logic circuits were switched off. \"Access. File. Information. Library. Galactic Press. Person. John Clay. Personal history.\n\"... Insufficient person specification. Please respecify at person.\"\n\"John Clay, Boardmember of Galactic Press. Personal History.\n\"... File accessed.\"\n\"Write Picture.\"\n\"... Insufficient picture specification. Please specify picture type.\"\n\"Facial, forward, most recent.\"\nThe light at the controller wall danced about for a moment, and suddenly the entire wall surface lighted up with a picture of Mr. Clay. Next to him was another man and a woman. They were all walking down a flight of stairs. The others looked vaguely familiar to Mike, but he couldn't place their names.\n\"Read picture from wall. Identify. Persons. All.\"\n\"... Persons identified.\"\n\"Say identifications.\"\n\"... Specify data format.\"\n\"Left to right. Name and official occupation.\"\n\"... Mrs. Helen Jaden, Galactic Press, Tizarian Division, Boardmember. Mr. Edmund Sandair, Galactic Press, Tizarian Division, Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. John Clay, Galactic Press, Tizarian Division, Boardmember.\"\nMike jotted down notes on a flimsy. \"Clear wall.\" When he turned back toward the controller wall, the entire surface was black.\n\"Say personal history, format brief.\"\nThe light at the center of the wall reappeared and began to flicker on and off. \"... Personal history, Mr. John Clay in memory. Loading format brief... Mr. John Clay. Born two-hundred and twelve standard days into the Imperial year five-hundred and ninty-one. Attended University of Arcadia majoring in interstellar corporate business. Highest degree received, Master's, at age of twenty-four standard years. Joined with Galactic Press Arcadian Division as marketing advisor in Imperial year six-hundred and sixteen. Was promoted to chief marketing advisor...\"\n\"Stop,\" Mike was getting bored, so he decided to zoom in on his real object of interest. \"Access file. Information. Library. Galactic Press. Person. Miss Robin Clay, niece of Mr. John Clay, Boardmember of Galactic Press. Personal History.\"\n\"... File Accessed.\"\n\"Write picture, Planetary Identification, Tizar, most current.\"\nA mug shot of the girl he met that afternoon slowly rotated on the controller wall. Mike studied it quickly and then prepared to jot down more notes.\n\"Say name. Format first, middle, last.\"\n\"... Robin Athena Clay.\"\n\"Say official occupation.\"\n\"... Independent contractor, gatherer, Galactic Press, Tizarian Division.\"\nMike blinked in disbelief. \"That's what I am.\"\n\"... Illegal command ignored.\"\nHe went to the kitchen, got an algea-cooler and some nutrichips, and returned to the bedroom. Sitting once again in front of the controller wall, he watched the flickering light at the center of the wall for nearly a minute before deciding on a course of action.\n\"Say list of accomplishments.\"\n\"... Illegal command ignored.\"\n\"Say list of articles where subject is mentioned.\"\nThe light at the center of the screen flickered for a while longer. With Cindy's interpretive processor shut down, the command would take time to be understood.\nThe light disappeared.\n\"Stop.\" Mike was becoming impatient.\n\"No process in effect. Command Ignored.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"... Illegal command ignored.\"\n\"Is subject mentioned in any articles?\"\n\"... Illegal command ignored.\"\nMike began to drink the cooler. He didn't stop until it was finished.\n\"Switch to higher brain mode.\"\n\"Hello Michael.\" The artistically feminine voice of the SNDI system, so often applauded by computer evaluators, had never sounded sweeter.\nMike got right down to business. \"I assume you have all the data of my conversation with your lower brain.\"\n\"You assume correctly.\"\n\"Is Robin mentioned in any articles?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Has she written any articles?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"What is her occupation?\"\n\"She's a gatherer.\"\n\"... Who hasn't written anything.\"\n\"That is correct.\"\n\"She has to have been mentioned in at least one article.\"\n\"She isn't.\"\n\"Cindy, check for birth announcements.\"\n\"There are none.\"\n\"Is there a copy of her birth certificate on file?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"When was she born?\"\n\"On the ninty-first day of six thirty-three.\"\n\"Nearly a year before Niki.\"\n\"That is correct.\"\n\"Where was she born?\"\n\"Greenflower, Silver-Tri county, Tizar.\"\n\"That's close.\"\nMike opened the package of nutrichips and began to munch. \"Cindy, in all your experience, when have you ever encountered a person who was born without the mandatory birth announcements?\"\n\"Offhand, Michael, I know of no single instance.\"\n\"Cindy, randomly choose one thousand people from that county, all who were born in six thirty-three, and tell me how many of those people do not have corresponding birth announcements in the news on the day of their birth.\"\n\"... There are zero people who do not have birth announcements.\"\nMike popped a few chips into his mouth, \"Check Tizarian Library files. See if her birth announcements are there.\"\n\"... There are birth announcements in the files of the Tri- Towers Library.\"\n\"Why don't we have them?\"\n\"Because when the file was loaded into my banks, the birth announcements weren't in place.\" She changed her tone of voice as if a little annoyed at the obvious question.\n\"Check in our own files for her birth certificate. When was it loaded into your banks.\"\n\"The ninety-ninth day of this year, six fifty-six.\"\n\"Why wasn't her birth announcement also loaded in.\"\n\"News files are read-only after their initial loading. There are no editing features available with this system due to the inherent unlawfulness.\"\nMike munched on some more nutrichips. They tasted good for a change, and he wondered what the deal was about Robin.\n\"Mike, you have a visitor at the front door.\"\n\"Identify.\"\n\"The visitor is not identifiable from the people in your files.\"\n\"Describe\"\n\"The visitor is female. She has blonde hair, blue eyes, her height...\"\n\"Stop. Open the door.\" Mike headed out of the bedroom and toward the front door. Robin was dressed in the white summer dress she wore to lunch.\nShe smiled, \"Hi.\"\nMike stepped outside. The sun was into its brilliant afternoon splendor, and the entire coast was lined with tanning bodies, just waiting to be sizzled to a crisp.\nHe smiled as if surprised, \"Hi. Come on in. I wasn't expecting you so soon.\"\nShe stepped forward cautiously, a little embarrassed, and at the same time enjoying her predicament. \"Well, I just happened to be cruising by... and when I remembered your address... and...\"\nThey both laughed.\nShe stopped in front of him and smiled. The sunlight caught her bright blue eyes, but he was prepared for them this time.\n\"Well, since you're here... would you like something to drink?\" He was careful not to talk into her. He didn't want to blow the second impression by the smell of munchies.\n\"Sure, if you have water.\"\nHe grinned, \"Sorry, we're all out. No, just kidding... c'mon.\"\nHe led her to the living room. Getting two glasses and filling them with water was no major task, and soon he found himself sitting at the chair next to the sofa he had missed the night before. She nimbly seated herself on the couch and accepted the glass of water from his hand.\n\"So,\" he started, \"Why ya really here?\"\nShe paused and then smiled, \"You said you'd show me some of the tools of the trade?\"\n\"Oh, sure.\" Mike went to the bedroom and picked up his camera and workset. When he returned, Robin was in the kitchen looking for a place to drop the empty glass.\n\"Should I just put it here on the countertop?\"\n\"Yeah. That'd be fine.\"\nShe walked back into the living room while Mike hooked together the camera. \"This is a Niko 700AR. The small lens in front here is an all-purpose zoom.\"\nShe walked over to him. \"Can I?\"\n\"Sure,\" he put it into her delicate fingers. \"Careful, it's kind of heavy.\"\nShe looked through the lens and smiled, \"Wow. Thirty all the way to a thousand millimeters... plus light intensification. No need for a flash.\"\n\"Yeah.\" Mike was pleased that she knew something about cameras. \"That's not all, look.\" He showed her the storage drive, printer, viewer, and controller board. \"Y'know what this is, too?\"\nShe stared in wonder. \"So this is top of the line.\"\nHe laughed. \"For external stills, it's as close to it as is practical to use. I mean, it's low tech enough that it can fixed on most worlds if it gets damaged, and, of course, it's replacable. That's its best feature. This thing here is the storage drive. It can hold up to ten-thousand photos in color. More in black and white. I can plug this hundred picture cartridge into the camera, take pictures, and then transfer them to the drive. If I decide that I don't like them later, poof; I delete them. This thing lets me see 'em, and this printer makes a hard copy. With the controller board you can also edit the pictures in a number of different ways-- splicing them, shooting color in, mixing them together, going in pixel by pixel and drawing. Like Niko says, `It defies the imagination.' So what'd'ya think?\"\n\"Pretty wild,\" She smiled.\n\"By the way, I heard you were a gatherer with the company.\"\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\"Linden said something about it.\"\nShe bit her lip, \"I'm just kind of getting into it. Right now I do some research for my uncle.\"\n\"Oh,\" Mike was disappointed, but he was far from through.\n\"What kind of research,\" he smiled innocently.\nShe mimicked the smile, staring straight into his eyes, \"Y'know, research.\"\nHe stopped the questioning. It was still too early.\n\"So,\" she continued, \"do you really make money at this?\"\nMike looked theatrically around the house. She laughed.\n\"Of course I make money at this.\"\n\"But how can you? Information is so cheap these days.\"\nDouble meaning, Mike thought. \"Yeah, it's cheap. But there are a lot of buying customers. Every two to four weeks the Tizarian Division puts out an issue of 'The Galactican.' Every year, I get a good enough story to convince them to give me a large cut of the paper. That, plus front page stories three or four times a year keep me going nicely. We sell to almost a trillion people in this sector alone. Now even if I took only a millicredit off of every buyer every year, you start adding up the numbers and tell me how rich I'd be.\"\nShe grinned, \"Very rich.\"\n\"Ridiculously rich. And I don't settle for any mere millicredit.\"\n\"Wow!\" She was being obviously sarcastic.\n\"And that's only half the story.\"\nShe smiled, \"What's the other half?\"\n\"Through writing these articles people get to recognize my name; and when I turn around to sell other writings, they'll go ahead and load copies into their own terminals since the price of information, as you put it, is so cheap.\"\n\"What other writings do you do?\" She seemed genuinely interested this time.\nMike shrugged, \"Political stuff, argumentative essays, that sort of thing.\"\n\"You must be a fantastic writer.\" She looked serious.\nMike grinned, \"Not really... Y'see, when it comes to writing, it's not the style or the syntax or anything like that. It's your subject. Most of the news people I've met are great writers, but they simply can't research a story. They fall flat on their faces when it comes to the subject simply because they start out with boring material.\"\nRobin looked confused, \"How can you say that? You're supposed to be a writer.\"\n\"No, I'm a gatherer, big difference. It's like your uncle said, the most important thing that I do right now is investigate. All the polishing can be left to the editor and staff, but researching the facts and getting them down is the most important thing for a gatherer. Hey, what're you doing?\"\n\"I'm putting this thing together.\" Robin connected the storage drive and monitor. She began paging through the memory.\n\"You sound like you're already missing it. What's this?\"\nThe picture was of a shallow sea. Sulferous storm clouds loomed heavy over the horizon, and a still yellow mist shrouded the water. Far away, a number of humanoid creatures crouched in the steaming mud and pointed toward the camara.\n\"That's Aiwelk\"\n\"Are those reptiles?\"\n\"Amphibians. They actually the decendants of mutated humans if you want to get technical.\"\n\"What are they doing there?\"\nMike smiled, \"They live there.\"\nRobin rabbit-punched him in the ribs. \"You know what I mean. What were you doing there?\"\n\"I was taking pictures.\"\nMike braced his ribs for the second blow.\n\"Okay, they say one picture's worth a thousand words. I was working on a safari expedition at the time.\"\nRobin gasped.\n\"It's not what you think. We were low on cash, so were hiring ourselves out as animal catchers. Aiwelk's a protectorate, so were couldn't catch there, but this science team hired us on to catch a few of these critters for 'scientific purposes.' They eventually set up a base on-world, but at the time, they were working from a circular satelite. I took some pictures, because the scientists wanted to know exactly where they came from, and what their physical and social environment was like. They already knew the physical pretty much, but they thought it was important to know who was standing next to who and how they were acting among themselves before we caught them. I don't know if that makes any sense.\"\nRobin nodded, \"So what'd you find out?\"\n\"Okay, y'see this character here, in the middle. He's like their shaman. No, I'm not kidding. One thing you learn in this job is that everybody's got their own screwed-up religion. Now, before he was, 'examined' physically all-the-way, okay, the scientists were able to decipher a good portion of their language from him, and with it a good portion of their beliefs.\"\n\"Because every language is constructed of beliefs and values.\"\n\"That's right. I couldn't have said it better. Now, he wasn't the strong guy, but he was more or less their leader, and without these stills with him in the center, and without the moving pictures we caught of him giving instructions, he'd have never gotten the special attention such an important 'specimen' deserves.\"\n\"What'd he think about being a specimen?\"\n\"I'm not sure he really thought about it at all.\"\nRobin zoomed in on him and refocused. The dark scales showed well in the poor light of the dim red star.\n\"So how'd they examine him physically?\"\n\"Oh, you know scientists.\" Mike looked away from the monitor.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Sometimes I just wish we let them be.\"\n\"Did they find anything unusual?\"\n\"Would it matter if they did?\"\nRobin suddenly looked irritated, \"Mind if I use the ladies room?\"\n\"Through that door and to your left.\"\nShe got up from the couch and went through the hallway to the bathroom, leaving Mike to gather his wits and wonder what it was that he said.\nHe looked toward the speaker unit by the videophone. Its black shiny surface glittered in the blue fluorescent light.\n\"Cindy?\"\n\"Yes Michael?\"\n\"Use the medical scanner on Robin but keep its light off.\"\n\"What do you want to know about her?\"\n\"Anything unusual.\"\n\"... She's taking her ear off.\"\nMike's heartbeat jumped. \"She's what?\"\n\"... She's taking her ear off, and she's not human.\"\n\"No shit... What is she?\"\n\"An android.\"\nJim is a full-time MBA student at UC Riverside. He recently founded the UCR Gamers' Guild and co-edited the first issue of its quarterly journal, `The Guildsman'.

The flat was still in chaos, furniture and personal belongings scattered haphazardly, but he was sure it was not because of the quarry. Sule stood in the doorway, sharp eyes transfixed upon her servant as soft, blue rays of predawn light fell silently along her icy, white mane. Vlep ignored her while she stood there contaminating the mental space with frustration.\nFrustration, definitely, and yet there was something underneath it, some sort of satisfaction.\n\"Nothing?!\"\nHe shook his head, \"It is as I told you before.\"\n\"You ran us into a dead end, before.\"\nVlep turned, cautiously. Her patience was like a strip of rubber ready to snap.\n\"Is it my fault that your quarry decided to go to the Runyaelin during the ceremony of sacrifice? How am I supposed to trace him from such a place of death?\"\n\"No excuses, psyche. I need information now.\"\nHe shrugged. She understood very little about the second sight. Explaining the difficulties would earn few favors. He decided to shovel out the few answers he had rather than bank on her dwindling hope.\n\"I will be plain Sule. I don't think this mess was caused by the quarry.\"\n\"You said Harrison was here.\"\n\"He was. I am certain of it. But I don't believe he did this.\"\n\"Why didn't you tell me this before.\n\"I was not sure before,\" he lied. \"Beside, would you have believed me?\"\n\"Come here, Vlep... closer.\"\nShe smacked the sheepish grin off his face before he even noticed her hand in motion. By the sting it left, he guessed that there would be blisters.\n\"When you have permission to think, I'll let you know. Until then you do as you're told. Clear?\"\n\"Ah, very,\" he replied, surprised that he hadn't seen it coming.\n\"Who is this person who is with Harrison?\"\n\"I don't know. A man, I think.\"\n\"And he didn't follow Harrison to the Runyaelin?\"\nVlep shook his head, \"I'm not sure. I was keying on Harrison only.\"\n\"Get me answers,\" Sule commanded, stepping back from the doorway.\nVlep rubbed the side of his face, looking again around the flat.\n\"He was looking for something.\"\n\"Obviously. Did he find it?\"\nVlep stepped into the hallway, crossing the threshold into the bedroom. The impressions were mixed and strong as before.\n\"The girl Harrison was with... it is difficult to see past her.\"\nRed twill hung silent in the still morning air. Somewhere up above, a bird was singing.\n\"Try harder, Vlep.\"\nHe put his hand on the window sill. A mixture of anxiety upon anxiety, fresh and unpolluted. Vlep crossed back to the front door, this time almost running.\n\"What is it?\"\nOutside, the sidewalk lay empty except for the clutter of dead leaves and the white, government car.\n\"What is it, Vlep?\"\n\"He sees something, yet it isn't there.\"\n\"What does he see?\"\nHe descended the steps, looking at the pavement directly in front of the flat. From the corner of his eye, he could see an alley cat cross the sidewalk and hide underneath the car, its two occupants oblivious to the intrusion, and in the back of his mind he heard the whine of a chemical engine.\n\"Vlep!\"\nVlep felt his arm extending to point down the street, \"He was running from something.\"\n\"Get in the car. You're going to take us where he went.\"\n\"No. I have to be on foot.\"\n\"Okay. Come people! Vlep's taking us for a walk.\"\nSoft voices crossed within the fog like knotted strands of hair, pulling taut and then snapping as they spiraled and blurred beyond recognition. The lumpy terrain seemed familiar, but the wispy, white haze swirled his recollection into a befuddled mass of disarranged static. Below, a small girl with long, sandy hair and wide, hazel eyes stood screaming, her voice lost within the vacant space between. Then the old city rose cautiously to its feet, a museum of looming statues, gargantuan and hollow, all abandoned except for the rush of tattered echoes, voices of bogeymen, or so he was told.\nHe'd occasionally see them, their skin drab and mottled. They kept a distance, eyes webbed with curiosity, daring to look but not to touch as he snapped images like a tourist at the zoo. Sometimes he pretended to be some famous archeologist searching for relics of the past, sneaking home later to bury his trophies before anyone should discovered his absence. The bogey-people didn't seem to mind. They would sometimes even leave him gifts which he would collect with a gravitic net and boil before handling.\nThey had only become angry once, and then they poured out enough anger to sate the frustration of an entire lifetime. Mobs of them had stormed the Naval Hospital, the one safe place in the old city or barrens as it became known. The underground routes to the suburbs were caved-in, and the overland barriers were laced with mines. After the battle, the hospital stood alone, the buildings around it reduced to rubble by explosive detonations. Hours were counted within by the number of corpses incinerated on the 40th floor. Volunteers, they were called.\n\"Put on the slickersuit, or you'll be next,\" his father had warned. Mike spent a week just learning how to secure the plastic helmet. Righty-tighty... clip, tighten, tie... swivel, clip, tighten, tie, check. Or was it tighten, clip? \"My son, the space cadet.\" He accepted his father's recognition with a sense of accomplishment, holding the memory with a youthful pride which bordered on the pompous. A year would pass before he learned that the comment wasn't meant as a compliment.\nHe cheeks wore a rosy hue that day, somewhat brighter than the burnt brown of the doctor's whose thick, blue veins and patchy tufts of white hair blew back and forth in the ventilating stink. Dirty beads of perspiration glistened on his brows, flowing in trickles from the wrinkles between his eyes, as he stacked small metallic cylinders into the small, silver box.\n\"Here boy,\" he offered in a soft but desperate voice. \"Take this to your mother. And watch yourself while you're out there. Lei got away; crafty, little runt.\"\nOutside, sunbeams bathed the asphalt in a bellowing heat, and the dust of the dead fell about him like a summer shower, clogging the filter as he unfastened the helmet and gulped for air. The buildings stood about him in various states of disrepair, the tall communications tower rising like a lone palm tree amidst a rocky and deserted beach. Memories of her running along the flat, wet sands sparked to mind. She'd been crying. Her brother destroyed the house she'd built for the small, white, kitten crabs. He couldn't remember why.\nSomewhere in the distance he heard her voice, sweat accumulating in his eyebrows as he searched the hillside. She stood near the top beside the old cathedral, its tall, stained-glass windows, once polished and beautiful before people came and painted graffiti on the saints. Now, instead of reading from scrolls, they played long violins and wore red and black headbands. The big guy in the dome window no longer smiled, and his chalice and loaf were replaced with a straight-backed snake and a bulging phallus.\nThey'd visited it several times. The few who attended sat in sparse clusters, their moods somber and suspicious. She'd once gone wandering, greeting people as they came in. His father grabbed her by the shoulder and put her over his knee. Later she asked him why, but he wouldn't explain. He just looked up at the dome, muttering something under his breath.\n\"Does Jesus sing, Daddy?\"\n\"He snaps the sticks, sweetheart. Can you hear him?\"\nThey never went back after that, but his mother told them stories about how people used to pray there, especially after what had happened. He didn't understand what she meant by praying, but it seemed like a serious business. It had something to do with the guys in the windows. She often showed him her favorite.\n\"Michael!?\"\nShe started running down the hill, her bony legs quaking with each hop until a moist patch suddenly gave way and she blundered into the thickets, her legs falling away from underneath, hurtling her into the dense brush below. He felt a cold lump of cotton form in his throat, stealing his voice. Then she crawled out, tears streaming down her cheeks as patches of blood showed through the knees of her white stockings.\n\"Mike, don't leave me. I'm afraid.\"\nA shaft of stark red cascaded from the dome, its bright, pulsing heat joining with the perspiration in his brows. Together, they splashed into his eyes, blinding him within in a warm veil of brine. For a moment he was aware only of the sun's broad cymbals clashing on his skull and of his pounding heartbeat and the sprinting sound of his feet touching the ground and leaving again in quick succession.\n\"Michael!\"\nThe pounding grew louder, like a sledgehammer crushing a block of marble, all the splinters shattering in all different directions, jumping out at people, bodies imploding in a maelstrom of hydrogen and fire, and then the blurry ground rising as he skidded and slid down the loamy slope, skipping over brambles and thrush as large stones protruded from the path to strike him. A dew-laden carpet of grass and twigs lay before his feet, the small, crooked trees emerging sporadically from the dense brush as birds scattered from their branches, the squashing noise of his sprint splashing dirty water toward either side.\nHe'd dropped the metal box somewhere far behind and kept running until her wails were only a thin whisper in the distance, the sound reverberating against the walls of his conscience, a texture soft and familiar but which he could never seem to reach.\n\"Namarie, nilimo, ve firnuvan hior.\"\nAnd then it faded until it was too quiet to distinguish as more than random noise.\n\"Mike...\"\nHis whole body tingled, a fluttering sensation as though he were chopped into pieces and frozen. He tried to move his fingers, yet his hands couldn't find them, nor could his arms find his hands, and so forth, all the way to his spirit, unshackled and floating free, ready to draw away with the gentle barrens wind.\n\"Son of a bitch is giving up... five more cc's.\"\n\"C'mon Mike, pull out....\"\nA thin man stood over him, watching Mike as though he were some spectacle at a freak show. Mike imagined the tall spokes jutting from his skull to be the long fronds of a palm, it's stalk swaying in the coastal wind. Thin, brown eyebrows danced like frolicking caterpillars, the soft eyes beneath shimmering a placid blue.\n\"Did you hear me? Five more!\"\n\"Got it....\"\nWith the sudden jolt in pulse-rate, Mike's fingers gripped at the null field for something to squeeze.\n\"Well... that worked....\"\nJohanes pulled back the syringe as the convulsions began, a rattling of bones against flesh all suspended in air.\n\"Is he gonna make it?\"\n\"Of course he will... although...\"\n\"Although?\"\n\"What's left when he gets back....\" Spokes shrugged his shoulders apathetically, \"Unhook him.\"\nBeneath a canopy of skull, thin fibers pulled taunt and disappeared, the throbbing hum echoing into the silence of an invisible rhyme. Johanes quickly cleaned the connections before replacing their caps, and Spokes bent over Mike, checking the pupil reflex with a bright penlight.\n\"How ya feeling, Harrison?\"\nMike felt the grid solidify as he involuntarily rotated toward the cheery voice. His eyes overcompensated for the distance making the figured blur in and out of focus, and he could hear a steady pounding in his head. Spokes slapped him on the cheek and watched as the sensation tingled slowly across the gatherer's face.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"You need to talk to me, Harrison. How many fingers do I have up?\"\n\"Uh... three.\"\n\"Excellent. You don't mind if I check out a few reflexes, do you?\" A crisp bolt of electricity arced from somewhere above, its touch like icy fire upon his forehead. Mike winced at the shock.\n\"Good. Now, try saying something intelligent for us.\"\nMike paused, finally blurting out the first thing that came to mind: \"Where am I?\"\nSpokes beamed, apparently impressed.\n\"Tyberian compound. How much do you remember?\"\nMike pictured Vilya sitting under the ventilation shaft, her dark hair shuffling gently in the damp current. From the corner of his vision he could barely discern the outline of her shadow amidst the yellow rays of sunshine which scattered evenly through an open doorway and onto the cold cement floor. All the while Spokes kept trying to make conversation, threatening to test a few more reflexes if Mike didn't mumble a response every so often.\n\"You folding up on me, Harrison?\"\nMike yanked his head to the side but the field re-solidified, closing him within a tight bubble of gravitational force. Spokes, looking vaguely apologetic, readjusted the controls as the field gently settled Mike to the floor.\nThe shadow and a pair of legs crossed the chamber in synchronous step, finally meeting like twin V's at a pair of quagga-hide loafers beside the bio-monitor's tall, metallic frame. Mike watched his own pulse rate in the electronic display for several seconds before he realized that it matched the faint pounding noise in his head. A pair of electronic pinchers still wavered carelessly in the gravitic null. The densest objects were always the last to fall due to over-compensation on the part of the computer. Johanes snatched them on their slow descent as he watched Spokes unplug the inertial modules. Then he looked toward Mike, his sweaty face the color of a rotten egg.\n\"Anybody home in there?\"\nMike considered the question carefully, but Johanes seemed impatient for a response.\n\"What's the matter? Can't he understand?\"\n\"Of course he understands; he's just a little whomped.\"\nSpokes finished stowing the equipment and turned around, a white plastic tube in one hand and a pair of silicon adapters in the other. He knelt down beside Mike, cautiously extracting a thread of optifiber from the tube and uncapping two of the jack's on Mike's skull.\n\"This is going to feel sorta funny, but we figure it's better to zap you while you're still dead to the world.\"\nSpokes worked both ends of the thread into the adapters, finally plugging them into Mike's skull so that the optifiber seemed to emerge at one point and sink back at another. Mike felt a tingling sensation within his joints which spread along his skin as Spokes sat back to admire his handiwork. The tingling slowly grew into a strange, blazing sort of itch, as though hundreds of electrical spiders were crawling within his stomach, head, and limbs. Spokes and Johanes held him down as the floor seemed to wrap itself around his body in a vain attempt to extinguish the fire. Johanes was talking in a worried tone, but Spokes kept shaking his head as if everything was normal.\nMike listened to the sound of the voices, finally accepting the burning sensation which swept back and forth along his spine and through his legs like the icy Aeluin on the gentle, sloping shores beside Erfalas. Then, it slowly began to transform itself into a numbing, almost paralytic massage, the tingling returning, and the entire series of sensations beginning anew and repeating, over and over. After more iterations than he cared to count, Mike noticed that the familiar hands which held him down during the burning periods had mysteriously disappeared. He waited for awhile to see if they would return, finally observing that the yellow rays were also gone, and the room was bathed in dim blue and pink, most of it generated by the bio-monitor's video display and small glowbeads scattered about the walls.\nReaching to his head almost instinctively, he carefully unscrewed the adapters, allowing the sensations to leave him like a decent lover: sweaty, sore and thirsty. A sluice-stick lay conscientiously beside him on the floor, and he chewed it open and sucked out the syrupy contents while righting himself into a sitting position. Something sharp bumped into his head, and he crouched back down, squinting toward the ceiling. A flimsi-leaf seemed to dangle in mid-air, \"try me\" scrawled across it in dim, glowing pink. Mike tugged it free from two long black cords which hung from one of the many ceiling cables, curling it and himself into a tight ball. The cold cement felt strangely comforting, the wet, sticky sluice still coating his numb lips as he watched the cords swing gently back and forth, beckoning in the dim light.\nHe reached toward them, propping himself up with one elbow as he tugged himself back into a sitting position. Mike examined them, cautiously, the dim pink light changing in intensity as the flimsi slowly stretched itself out. The cords ended in adapters not unlike those he had recently unscrewed. Shrugging, he screwed the new ones into where they seemed to fit. At first he could just hear voices, but from the shadows around him, ghosts seemed to emerge.\n\"Well look who's here.\"\n\"Hey, Harrison. How ya feeling?\"\n\"Who is he?\"\n\"Must be a novice. He doesn't seem to be very talkative.\"\nMike felt a sudden jolt of static like an electric slap across his senses.\n\"Hey, cut it out. He's my guest.\"\n\"Sorry.\"\n\"Hey Mike. That was pretty quick. You okay?\"\n\"Spokes?\" Mike gulped down, blinking his eyes to refocus. It didn't seem to matter whether his eyes were open or closed. They were still there, all the same.\n\"Yeah, it's me. Cecil's here too.\"\n\"Hi there, little one.\"\nCecil's image seemed to have yellow eyes, shining faintly through an acidic smog like the sun on Tyber. Mike nodded, still contemplating whether or not to tear the twin cords from his skull.\n\"You seem a little uneasy.\"\nMike shrugged, \"I've having a weird day.\"\n\"I zapped him after we installed his output,\" Spokes explained.\n\"So soon?!\" The yellow eyes flared brightly.\n\"Easy Cecil. Johanes said they were in a hurry.\"\nThe eyes dulled and tilted slightly.\n\"So how did you like the jitters, Michael?\"\nMike frowned, \"What's he talking about?\"\n\"Technical stuff. In order to stick in the outputs, we have to go all the way to the amygdala, and that means that we have to get close to the hippocampus.\"\n\"The butcher speaks.\" It was a voice from the crowd.\n\"Shut-up; I didn't do him,\" Spokes retaliated.\n\"I'm lost,\" Mike confessed.\n\"Whenever you go that deep, anything can happen. The mind has a tendency to flip-out sometimes. We talked about it before the operation.\"\n\"We did?\"\n\"Yeah. You don't remember, but we did. That's another problem with getting too close to the hippocampus. It tends to scramble short-term memory.\"\n\"The last thing I can remember it talking to Johanes.\"\n\"He brought you in this morning. We took you to the doc.\"\nYellow eyes seemed to dance in circles.\n\"The doc?\"\n\"The butcher,\" Cecil interrupted. \"I felt that I still owed you a favor.\"\n\"Some favor,\" Mike mumbled, except that his voice carried across the ether loud and clear, much to the amusement of several electronic loiterers. Even Spokes seemed to get a good snort out of it. Then he turned serious, as though perfectly able to jump from one emotion to the other without crossing the intervening space.\n\"It was time to join the club, Mike.\"\n\"Is that why you're helping me now? Because you wanted a new member for your sick society?\"\n\"No, actually I'm getting paid.\"\n\"Johanes?\"\n\"Yep.\"\n\"So where's he been while I've been twitching on the floor all day?\"\nMike heard a few more snorts, exact replicas of the earlier ones, except this time some vague maniacal laughter seemed to hover in the distance, yellow eyes swirling excitedly.\n\"You can stop talking with your mouth now, Harrison. Everybody can hear you. Use your head. Just look at me and focus.\"\n\"Like this?!\"\n\"Hey....\"\n\"What were you doing to me today, Spokes?!\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"I'm talking about the funny feeling you said I'd have. Can you see how much I'm laughing?!\"\nMike felt an on-rush of static block the way between them. Cecil stopped laughing and stared intently.\n\"What are you two fighting about?\"\n\"He's pissed 'cause I zapped him,\" Spokes confided.\nThe yellow eyes nodded, knowingly.\n\"It had to happen eventually, old friend. Spokes let your mind get to know itself. Auto-feedback was all it was. The pathways have to build-up mental calluses, and you have to learn to deal with pain. Spokes here is surprised you came out as quickly as you did. For many people, it takes much longer.\"\nMike straightened, \"I don't understand.\"\n\"Johanes wants you to go into the dodec,\" Spokes interrupted. \"If it tries to nail you in any way, the only chance you're going to have is if you have some resistance. You understand?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Well don't worry about it. It was for your own good.\"\n\"Where is Johanes, and where is the dodec?\"\n\"He went back to the Arien Mansion. He took the dodec with him, Mike.\"\n\"Shit. Where are you?\"\n\"At the Sintrivani.\"\n\"You mean you guys got done with me and just left me here to rot?\"\nSpokes sort of shook his head and nodded at the same time, \"Johanes said that ISIS has some psyche bloodhound sniffing your trail but hard. He went for help to smear the scent, but neither of us are yearning to be around you right now. Is that so hard to understand?\"\n\"I've heard enough.\"\n\"Johanes said he'd be coming back for you, so don't go any...\"\nMike unscrewed the cords from his jacks and watched the electric apparitions evaporate into darkness as graciously as they had appeared. Outside, a chilly breeze flapped across the streets, lifting loose dirt and leaves into the sky and inducing the hairs on his bare chest to prickle and tense in rows. With a fuzzy warm ambience enshrouding his senses, he ambled along the side of the road, waving down a taxi before the main gates.\n\"Where to?\"\nThe driver was middle-aged, his sparse, graying hair combed straight back, eyes sunken and tired in the rear-view mirror. Mike dipped his hands into his pockets, the emptiness sparking an image of Cecil's money in a pool of blood. Sighing, he mumbled an apology and shuffled himself out of the car.\n\"Is okay. Where you want to go?\"\n\"I'm broke.\"\n\"Get in.\"\nThe driver opened the front door to prove his sincerity, and Mike climbed in, unsure whether to thank him or just do as he was told, and the driver looked sympathetic.\n\"You know where you're going?\"\n\"Erfalas.\"\nMike felt his back and shoulders affix themselves to the plastic seat covers, a sticky noise resulting every time the car hit a bump in the road. The driver either didn't notice, didn't mind, or was just being polite.\n\"So what the name of you?\"\n\"Michael; my friends call me Mike. You?\"\n\"Pateras; my friends call me Pat,\" he qualified with a smirk.\n\"Why the charity?\"\n\"You look like you need it. You know the output of you bleeds?\"\nMike reached to his skull, withdrawing a smear of pasty orange puss.\n\"Here, use this.\"\n\"A towel?\"\n\"Hitch-hiker must never forget it.\"\nMike draped it over his head, catching the ullage as it tried to drip down his neck. The rest began to dry into a sticky crust.\n\"The daughter of me was a chiphead. She tell me which is input and which is output. That all I know.\"\n\"She was a chiphead? What is she now?\"\nThe man half smiled, half winced. He dug out his wallet and extracted the image plate. Mike leafed through those in memory, several of his little girl, first as a baby and finally as a teenager with all the years in between. The last one showed a bald kid in a hospital bed.\n\"They burn out head of her, you know. She not know which way was up.\"\nMike handed back the plate.\nErfalas was cold and windy, and the driver offered him the towel.\n\"What have I need of it? Is blood of you. You clean, yes?\"\n\"Yeah. Thanks for the ride.\"\nHe stood, watching, as the tail-lights ebbed into the distance. The beach was soft and sandy, and moonlight sparked along the watery horizon, however, the hooks on the cliffs were no longer to be seen. Only rarely would one emerge from the pounding waves, and then it would sparkle like a diamond across the dim, lavender seaside.\nMike winced as the cold water stung his scalp and the bleeding renewed. Though he couldn't smell any salt, the nerves around the wound told him that some was there. He finally staggered out of the water, throwing the towel around his body as he curled up between two tall rocks. The cold breeze continued to blow airy waves of fine white dust over his still form. Sticking to his skin, the tiny particles bonded together in the darkness and slowly dried until he found himself wearing clothing made of sand that cracked and flaked away when he shifted in half-slumber.\nFaint violet rays warily peeked over the eastern horizon, glinting across the smooth, narrow stretch of sand which teased the incoming waves. Beneath the noise of water grasping toward shore, Mike heard the distant gurgle of a chemical engine. At first, he thought it was the final illusory fragment of a dream, but the sound grew steadily, until it resided at the top of the cliff where Vilya had shown him the eyehooks and so splendidly demonstrated their use. Several people were climbing out of a white, government car, each peering toward the dim violet horizon. Half-buried by the sand, Mike watched them from his shadowy lair between the two tall rocks. He tried to make out their features in the faint, shifting light, but it was difficult even to count them. Then he glimpsed the white mane, its owner allowing the breeze's gentle tendrils to reshuffle her hair to its own liking, and for a silent moment his eyes widened with fear.\nJim Vassilakos (jimv@ucrmath.ucr.edu) just graduated from UCR with an MBA.

Beneath the cliff's grey face, an undulating seascape swayed tauntingly, the roar of pounding waves echoing between the sharp protruding rocks along the dim, purple coastline. It was like Harrison to come to such a place, she thought. It would be even more like him to stay. She motioned Jun and Clark down the rocky slope along either side of the ridge as Vlep massaged the rocks at the head of the cliff, laying on one side as he reached downward along its face.\n\"What is it, Vlep?\"\n\"Fear.\"\n\"Harrison's?\"\n\"Either his or that of children who were sacrificed so long ago. Who can tell?\"\n\"You'd better.\"\nVlep looked up, a light drizzle beginning to fall from the clouds above.\n\"The quarry was definitely here, Sule. I can feel his presence and that of his psyche all over these rocks.\"\n\"Go down.\"\nVlep slumped his shoulders, wishing he hadn't revealed so much. Carefully stepping along the damp, slippery face of the cliff, he crept down part way and then looked back up, half expecting mercy.\n\"It is not very safe, Sule.\"\n\"Be careful.\"\nVlep sighed, certain that she would be the death of him yet. Continuing to the eyehooks, he could sense fear all the stronger, most of it his own. And yet there was more, like the gleam of a diamond in the middle of a dim, crimson pool, water splashing all around yet never washing away the stain. The roar of the waves seemed to lose rhythm, and then the screech of brakes imparted a small cloud of falling dust, bits of sand sprinkling upon him along with the soft morning shower.\nVlep climbed back up. It was the guard Sule had posted at the Tyberian Compound. He was holding a small, black object before Sule, his eyes gleaming in the dim predawn light.\n\"Look Sule. The android brain.\"\n\"Very good, Mito. Did the gatherer come back?\"\n\"No, a boy. It was dark, and I made a mess of him. I'm sorry, Sule.\"\nShe bit her lip.\n\"Forget it. We have what we're looking for.\"\n\"What about the quarry?\"\n\"This dodec is the real quarry, Mito. Now go collect the others, and call in the hydrofoil. I have a delivery to make.\"\nVlep dusted himself off, thankful for the reprieve.\n\"Does that hunk of cermic mean that I don't have to go swimming?\"\n\"What did you find out?\"\n\"Is very hard to say. Harrison's impressions are probably more than fifty cents old, possibly as much as a full day, but the fear is very intense.\"\n\"Strange.\"\n\"I know what you are thinking, Sule. If he wanted to take a boat, this cliff is not the best point of access.\"\n\"He didn't dive off?\"\n\"He climbed down and then back up. I'm certain.\"\n\"One immediately following the other?\"\nVlep shook his head, \"That is hard to tell. The impressions go right into the water.\"\n\"If he knows about headquarters...\"\n\"How could he?\"\n\"I want you to continue to track him wherever the trail leads from here. Take the others in the jeep and leave me with the government car. We'll meet back at the Arien Mansion for Erestyl's appointment. Understood?\"\nClark carefully descended the steep hillside, a flashlight in one hand and an automatic pistol in the other. Purple-hued sands shifted in the crisp sea breeze, droplets from above snaking through the turbulent air as two pointy rocks jutted up from the beach, their shiny grey surfaces glinting ominously in the faint predawn light. He crept toward them, shining his flashlight into the narrow crack between.\n\"Clark!\"\nHe turned, unsteady, as the wind tossed a shower of soft sand into his eyes.\n\"Damn. Mito?\"\n\"It's just me, Clark.\"\nClark lowered the pistol, shaking the dirt from his eyes.\n\"I heard you pull up. You bring the IR goggles?\"\n\"Yeah, they're in the jeep. They came in real handy.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"That android brain. It showed up at the Tyberian Compound. Lucky me.\"\n\"Harrison went back?\"\nMito shook his head, \"A kid. I was so raw I just blew him away without thinking. I feel like crap.\"\n\"No shit.\"\n\"C'mon, Sule wants us.\"\nMike stayed between the rocks until the wind stole their voices. One glance in infrared and he knew he'd be finished.\n\"What I still don't understand is how you got him to agree. The Arien's couldn't be too thrilled about working for ISIS.\"\nSule smiled, \"Everyone has a price, Vlep; albeit, not everyone yearns for the same commodity.\"\n\"You speak in riddles, traveler.\"\n\"Is that what you dirtsiders call neghrali who have power over you?\"\nThe others arrived, each one posing in the typical \"recruit's stance\", trying not to stand out from one another for fear of being ordered to do something either dangerous or repugnant. Finally, Clark stepped toward the jeep, pulling a pair of infrared goggles from the back seat. He turned back, examining the landscape on both sides of the cliff as the gentle rain continued to fall.\n\"Nothing.\"\nMike surfaced from the frigid waters as the jeep began pulling away. The woman sat leaning against the hood of the government car, her wet, stringy hair blending against the white paint. Ducking back beneath the waves, he swam to the foot of the cliffs, wading into shore beneath the steep hillside. He dropped to the ground when the faint hum of a hydrofoil played across the windswept waves. Slowing and settling amid the choppy crests, the craft's two gravitic modules kept its thick, silver frame from sinking entirely.\nHe recognized it as the Tizarian Skipstone-Cruiser, one of the few fast and submersible, four-seater hydrofoils on the market. The more popular SkipstoneSafari model discarded two seats in favor of an autocannon and munitions magazine. Mike remembered reading about how vacationers preferred to shoot the local critters rather than take their friends along to snap images.\nMike ducked back down when he heard the splash, and by the time he mustered the courage to peek over the rocks, the blonde woman was already aboard, her white mane dripping in the tender morning drizzle. She carried the dodec, and Mike gritted his teeth in disappointment as the vehicle turned sharply about and sped into the distant horizon.\nThe government car's fiberglass window put up a valiant resistance, but Mike eventually forced his way inside. Reaching under the dash, he yanked loose two wires and crossed one over the other. The engine coughed and turned over, finally starting with a belated roar, and Mike found an automatic pistol and three clips of ammunition resting inside the glove compartment along with a pair of handcuffs and a pack of breath mints. He smiled, shifting the stick into reverse and letting up on the clutch. With only a mild groan, the car lurched backward down the back of the hillside. He wheeled the car around and stepped on the gas, memories of the chase on Telmar flooding into his mind. Mike had been driving while Davin and Bill were at the back window, unloading everything they had into their pursuers. If they'd only pulled over and ditched the car, he figured maybe Davin would have survived.\nThen he noticed his mistake.\n\"Hey...look at that.\"\nClark peeked over Jun's shoulder. The blue monitor showed a pixel of light trudging upward from bottom toward center.\n\"Sule?\"\n\"Bet you a month's wages it's Harrison.\"\nClark's eyes widened, threatening to jump out from their sockets. Then the pixel disappeared.\n\"Yep. It's him.\"\n\"Turn around and floor it!\"\nThe jeep ground to a near stop before swinging around and speeding back toward the coast.\n\"Why weren't you able to find him, Vlep?!\"\n\"I...I've got a real bad feeling about this.\"\nMito groaned, \"Look, just everyone shut-up. If he gets away, we're all dead. You understand?!\"\nClark clicked off his pistol's safety switch and stood up in the seat, firing several rounds into the tall brush.\n\"Over there! He's off the...\"\nThe jolt in his chest sent Clark sprawling backward off the vehicle. A few moments later, several rounds had shattered the windshield. The jeep skidded to a halt, and two figures darted into the brush as Mito fired on the government car from behind his driver's door. The left side of his neck suddenly spattered open, hurtling him into the door.\n\"Shit, he's behind us.\"\nVlep kept his nose to the ground as Jun fired numerous rounds into the bushes, finally dropping down to reload. With his head pounding, he tried to pull himself to his feet and assume a covering position, but something in his brain told him to stay down, freezing his legs into place. Meanwhile, Jun fumbled a clip of ammunition into the handle of his automatic.\n\"What are you doing just laying down?!\"\nVlep opened his mouth to respond, but there was no need. Jun's head had already swiveled forcibly, a bullet's impact ripping the nose clean from his face. Jun tried to turn back around, raising his firearm toward the bushes and squeezing the trigger, but his skull popped sideways, a red cascade with bits of bone erupting from his ear and flailing into the cold rain. Vlep wanted to raise his weapon also, but his hand remained frozen, his entire body quaking with indecision as he felt the quarry's presence sweep over him. He waited several moments for the recognition of death that his elders had taught him to respect, but instead, he saw only Harrison, panting in the windy precipitation, clutching a firearm which was aimed steadily in his direction. There was no vision, no angels to lift his spirit, but only the thunderous pounding of an icy, blue curtain into a wall of grey hillside. So they waited together, each to his own thoughts, as Harrison bent over slightly to catch his breath, and together they listened to the crashing waves and the angry chirping of white-feathered gulls that rose haltingly like the voices of crying children caught somewhere in that vertical plane between the clash of two mighty and unrelenting elements.\nCrystal blue eyes surveyed the horizon, daring a blink only as the hydrofoil came into view.\n\"You look thirsty, Mr. Clay.\"\nThe Director offered him a purple-violet concoction, Draconian dweomerwyne if memory served.\n\"It's been a while since I've seen her.\"\n\"It.\"\nClay smiled as he accepted the highbowl. It bobbed slightly in total ignorance of the waves. Steadying it with two fingers, he allowed a portion of the crisp, sweet liquid to drain down his throat.\n\"Robin is more than an it, Director, even if we must be enemies now.\"\nThe Director nodded. She seemed more bemused than interested. Clay sighed and turned back toward the railing as the hydrofoil slowly turned and circled. It kicked up water, splashing it away from the houseboat as it slowed to a full stop. Tossing it a line, the deck hand slowly reeled it in and lowered a stiff rope ladder. Sule hopped on board and showed her prize to the director, but Clay ignored them both, at once revolted and yet strangely entranced by what his psuedoniece had become.\n\"What's the matter, Mr. Clay?\"\n\"It's just strange to see Robin like this.\" He accepted the dodec from Sule, adding, \"I suppose it's all she ever was.\"\n\"Let us hope so. What of the gatherer, Sule?\"\n\"He still eludes us. I left Mito in charge of the pursuit team, and they are continuing the search as we speak.\"\n\"I still want him.\"\n\"Director, I am working with untrained, unskilled, untalented...\"\n\"I am aware of your excuses, Sule. Find him. And while you are at it, you might as well take Ambassador Kato and Erestyl with you. We don't want them to be late for Mr. Arien. Meanwhile, we'll let Mr. Clay crack the dodec for us. I trust that Robin knows you, John?\"\nClay grimaced, \"It does.\"\nHe stepped below deck as Major Doran emerged with the Draconian Ambassador. Cuffed and half-conscious, she looked more like the door prize at a Calannic orgy than a high ranking diplomat. Sule regarded the Draconian with a contemptuous scowl.\n\"I take it she has not been completely cooperative.\"\n\"She made her decision, Sule. It is unfortunate that we could not use her.\"\n\"She could be valuable, Director.\"\n\"I doubt it.\"\n\"With her knowledge of the DSS...\"\n\"What knowledge?\"\nSule caught the Ambassador as she slumped forward into her arms. Doran smiled and returned below deck.\n\"But when the drugs wear off.\"\n\"What drugs?\"\nSule nodded, finally understanding.\n\"Mr. Arien may not accept her in this condition.\"\n\"You will make certain that he does not know until it is too late.\"\nThe deck hand carried Ambassador Kato to the hydrofoil as Doran emerged with Erestyl. The Cassiopeiaen physicist looked emaciated and worn, his small body no more than a slender bag of bones. The scanner operator accompanied them, a sheepish look of uselessness about him as he ran his fingers through a patch of curly, red hair. Sule motioned Doran toward the hydrofoil and then turned back to the operator.\n\"No luck?\"\nHe shrugged, \"Erestyl put up a determined fight. I think we can crack him with enough time, but there's a risk that we may wipe the information we're looking for. What we really need is a telepath.\"\n\"What about the ambassador?\"\n\"We didn't really have a chance. It was obvious from the onset that she was well trained in resisting the scanner. That, plus her psychic talents...we just decided to go in and make her useless to the Draconians. She'll have the drugged look for the rest of her life. With therapy, maybe she could learn to talk again, if she's lucky.\"\nSule nodded, turning back toward the director.\n\"I'll be back with Erestyl tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Terminate him after you receive the necessary information from Mr. Arien. We can't chance him falling back into Draconian hands.\"\n\"And what of Mr. Arien?\"\n\"He'll be taken care of once we are all offworld. We have already reserved rooms aboard the Crimson Queen. Before another day begins, we will be aboard her, traveling back to Ares in the very lap of luxury.\"\nSule smiled, \"Assuming all goes well. You know I can't guarantee Harrison. But when we're done with Erestyl, I'll radio you.\"\n\"Forget about Harrison. We can dispatch a unit to Tizar to deal with him when he returns.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nMajor Doran sat at the pilot's seat as Sule entered the hydrofoil's fuselage.\n\"Where's the pilot?\"\n\"You're looking at him.\"\nSule nodded, \"Well, what are we waiting for?\"\nThe hydrofoil sped away, skipping along the waves as it reached 150 kilometers per hour. Back aboard the houseboat, Clay was supervising the techies.\n\"Turn the camera on me. I want to be the first thing she sees. You're ready with the access code?\"\n\"Check.\"\n\"Okay, make the connection.\"\nThe deafening noise sped across the waves, and for a bare instant, Sule thought that god had dropped a piece of the sun on the ocean just to watch the steam it would make. In back of them, the fireball increased in size until she could feel the heat blistering her face through the windshield. She hit the stick, but power control was already gone. The blast shock sent them tumbling end over end, finally drilling them into the water as a huge tidal crest swept overhead. Cold water jetted into the cabin as the superstructure creaked and whined, threatening to implode with each passing moment.\n\"Doran!\"\nHe was knocked out cold.\n\"Damnit, Doran!\"\nShe scrambled out of her seat and unfastened his belt, throwing him into the back as she tangled with the controls.\n\"How do I stabilize? Doran, wake up!\"\n\"Wha...?\"\n\"How do I re-start this thing?!\"\n\"Lower left...pull it.\"\nThe craft's engines refused to acknowledge her efforts. Even the ultra-reliable gravitic units balked at their call to duty.\n\"The electronics must be fried.\"\n\"Floatation...\"\n\"What?!\"\nThe major pointed toward a red lever on the corner of the floor. She unhitched its safety and gave it a stern yank. A moment later, she heard a gas release. Two yellow bags appeared from the bow, slowly raising the craft toward the surface as Doran tried to find his way to the front passenger seat.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"We got nuked, Major.\"\nThe noise of the blast could be heard up and down the coast for more than twenty kilometers. Mike looked skyward, expecting to see a wasp fighter just crossing the sound barrier. The morning clouds were burning off fairly quickly, and a majestic rainbow cut between bands of blue, white, and grey clear from one horizon to the other. He squinted at the continual on-rush of air, quietly cursing himself for shattering the jeep's front window. If he'd only remembered to shut off the tracer on the government car, he could have avoided the entire situation.\nIt was noon before Mike reached the geyser or Sintrivani as it was known locally. He parked along the ridge facing the coast beneath a tall hotel and condominium complex. Below the ridge, the hot waters of the Sintrivani shot from a manmade spring, reaching well over half a kilometer in altitude before they came tumbling back to earth in the form of a warm, misty veil. A crowd composed mainly of children flew about in saucershells, small makeshift floaters shaped as flattened spheres. They soared with gleeful zeal to the top of the geyser while dodging and just as often crashing into loose globules of water held together by faint geepoints in the giant low-gravity field. Those without the shells contented themselves with jumping upwards, a hundred meters or more, and then coasting back to the surface, splashing water pockets on friends and strangers. Naked above the waist and barefoot, Mike figured he didn't look very much out of place.\nHe found Cecil and Spokes camping out on the circular cement amidst about a hundred other people, mostly parents. If it wasn't for their gleaming head-jacks and Cecil's three cameras connected to his skull via invisible radio beams, they would have looked like the stars of some Tizarian vacation commercial, laying back in lounge chairs eating pocket-bread meat pies and sipping iced guava juice beneath tall, shady umbrellas. Vilya's cat wandered nearby, coaxing food from children and parents alike. Mike approached, carefully side-stepping its stage ego, as the two chiphead nodded their acknowledgments.\n\"Greetings, gatherer.\"\n\"Well if it isn't Mr. Lucky.\"\nMike sat down on the green, ice chest between them, picking out a bottle of guava and uncapping it with his teeth. Spokes regarded him with a mysterious mixture of fascination and regrets.\n\"Where did you go last night?\"\n\"The beach.\"\n\"Johanes told us that the Imps came looking for you at the Tyberian Compound. Said he almost got nailed coming back for you. A mutual acquaintance of yours bit it in there.\"\nMike gulped down the juice. It was bitter and tangy, the sort of stuff best sipped during idle hours under the sun rather than taken in mouthfuls.\n\"Good time for you to take a vacation, Spokes?\"\n\"I'm just a part-timer. I'm not going back until Johanes tells me this thing is over.\"\n\"Where is he, by the way?\"\n\"In the condo. He's watching the news. Something big must have happened, I guess.\"\nMike nodded, \"Then that's where I'm going.\"\nThe main lobby was about as clean as Mike remembered it, sand scattered about on turquoise tiles, white walls smudged with the occasional dirty hand print, and children running about everywhere. Mike strolled through cautiously, slowly scanning the faces as a hazel-eyed girl ran by. Upstairs, the floors were cleaner, the noise level much quieter. Cecil once said that he liked the quiet as much as the noise and that he would refuse to buy into a place without a balance of the two. Mike tested the door and then knocked when he found it locked, pressing his palm against the peeper. A long moment passed, and then the door swung outward, almost knocking Mike on his rear. Johanes hunched down on the floor, reaching up with a pistol.\n\"Michael.\"\nMike put his hands up, waving them like a politician seeking office.\n\"Hey, take it easy. I just wanted to surprise you.\"\n\"A guy can get dead that way.\"\n\"Like the kid?\"\nJohanes dropped the pistol on a counter top, hesitating ever so slightly as Mike laid out the question. A flicker of resentment invaded his eyes even as he shook it off, crossing the room to turn up the volume on the three-vee.\n\"His name was Nicholas.\"\nThey sat on the floor in front of the depth box as three-dimensional images of gravcars and choppers circled over an empty expanse of sea. In the background, a reporter was chattering about devastation to the oceanic wildlife. The scene cut to the cliffs of Erfalas. Mike's eyes widened as mention of a nuclear detonation reached his ears.\n\"I heard it.\"\n\"Was it loud?\"\n\"Sort of.\"\n\"They say it was small. Under a hectoton. Good thing the magnetic pulse didn't reach this far.\"\nOutside the window Mike could see dozens of children circling the giant, watery plume. He imagined the gravity inhibitors failing as tiny bags of blood and bone would spatter on the wet cement.\n\"Quite a image for your Galactican. Eh, Michael? Front page material?\"\nMike gulped down a hunk of air, belching it back out with as much force as he could muster. Johanes grinned wearily as Mike studied his reflection on the glass.\n\"You thought that was funny?\"\nJohanes nodded, \"Proof that we're real men. We've got guns, and we can make disgusting noises.\"\n\"There's more where that one came from.\"\n\"Spare me.\"\n\"On one condition...you tell me why it happened.\"\nJohanes dropped his grin, \"They're still trying to figure that part out.\"\n\"About Nicholas.\"\nHe shifted, then shrugged, \"What's to say? We were coming back to pick you up. He ran inside before me, and then I heard gun spray. You want me to say it straight out? I got scared and ran away.\"\n\"Why did the kid have...\"\nA knock at the door cut him off. It was Cecil, bitching about how he was being locked out of his own place. Johanes looked toward the door sluggishly and then turned back toward the three-vee.\n\"You get it.\"\nCecil looked somewhat disgruntled as Mike opened the door, as though the sanctity of his domestic life were somehow threatened by his old friend's presence. He seemed to cheer up when he saw Johanes, however. Even the kitty seemed entranced by the Draconian as it half-jumped, halffell from Cecil's arms to greet him.\n\"Down you go, Pooper-dumper.\"\nMike winced, \"Pooper-dumper?\"\n\"Cat had to have a name. How do, Johanes? Much good on the boob-box?\"\nMike scratched his head and tried to look offended.\n\"You're happy to see him but not me?\"\n\"We figured that if he was still here, it's probably safe to be around you.\"\n\"Hey Harrison,\" Spokes came in lugging two of Cecil's cameras.\"Gimmie a hand with the ice chest, will ya?\"\n\"Where's his other cam?\"\n\"Look out the window.\"\nMike grabbed one end of the chest and dragged it inside, looking outside the window into the silvery mist of the geyser as he reached the center of the room. A girl was gliding Cecil's camera upward in her saucer-shell, steering it toward the apartment complex while warm blankets of mist fell over her, making her appear halfsolid, half-ethereal. Cecil was already on the balcony waving for the others to follow. Only Johanes refused, and Mike couldn't resist making rabbit-eared fingers over his old friend's head. Cecil noticed it right away, of course, but he snapped the image anyway. When they came back inside, it danced about on the three-vee, changing hue and shade with each new iteration.\n\"Will send a copy to Tizar. You can consider it our team photo.\"\nSpokes winced, \"Do me a favor and don't let it get out. I don't want to be more connected to this gatherer than I already am.\"\nMike grinned, \"Can I quote you?\"\n\"I'm serious, Harrison. I could already lose my job.\"\nCecil snorted, trying to cover up his reaction as Spokes looked him over.\n\"You got a problem with my job now?\"\n\"Other than that it stinks, none whatsoever.\"\n\"Yeah, well it's safe. I like safe. I don't have any psychotic urges like other certain people to be a big hero. I don't need medals and trophies. Money will do just fine, thank you.\"\n\"Speaking of trophies,\" Johanes dug something out the bottom of the trash container, \"Catch, Michael. We were saving her for you.\"\nMike watched it tumble in mid-air, the etching of a song bird on jet black. With a fluster of clashing perceptions, he fumbled the dodec to the floor, still scarcely believing his own eyes.\n\"Well, either you're a lousy catch...\" Johanes looked out the window, watching the tiny blue waves sway along the horizon. He decided to snatch his pistol off the counter top, slipping its nose down the crack between his butt cheeks as he turned back toward Mike.\n\"Tell me you're just a lousy catch.\"\nMike shook his head, turning toward the three-vee and then back again. It all started to make sense.\n\"Your doing?\"\n\"I'll explain later.\"\nSpokes looked worried and confused, stepping out of his way as Johanes headed for the door.\n\"Hey, where're you going?\"\n\"Out for a walk.\"\nJohanes headed down the hall toward the elevator as Spokes watched after him in the doorway, ducking down so his tall jacks wouldn't scrape against the frame.\n\"Well at least tell me if it's still safe to be here!\"\nShe found the white government car resting slightly off the road, all four of its tires punctured with bullet holes. Three corpses were propped over it, and rigor mortis had already set in. Not being in the mood for a burial, she would allow them to rot in the white, hot sun. Vlep was asleep at the steering wheel. That he had been hand-cuffed to it without sustaining so much as a bruise angered her even more. It meant he gave in without a fight. She expected as much from a psyche. Leaning close to his ear, she allowed her breath to brush the soft wax within.\n\"Vlep!!!\"\nHe hit his head on the roof, nearly tugging his wrist out of joint in the process.\n\"Sule?\"\n\"Who did you think it was? Your fairy godmother?!\"\n\"Sule...Harrison was here.\"\n\"Really?!?\"\nShe grabbed the steering wheel, yanking it clear of its housing. Vlep tumbled out of the car, dropping to the ground at her feet. He knew she was strong. Biosynthetics often had that tendency. But he had no idea she was that strong. He picked himself and the steering wheel up from the dirt, dusting himself off with his one free hand.\n\"I...I can follow him, Sule. I can find him.\"\nShe watched him with a mixture of sympathy and scorn.\n\"I don't care about Harrison, you idiot. I don't give a damn about the robot brain. This futile chase has cost us everything.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"Everything, Vlep! HQ is gone!\"\n\"How?\"\n\"Look at my sunburn and take a wild guess!\"\nVlep pondered the problem, his mind refusing to so much as acknowledge the possibility of a nuclear detonation. Sule watched the skepticism fade from his eyes, finally kicking a dent into the car door to vent her anger.\n\"I've got the major and two prisoners in the hydrofoil. They're probably going to be sick, and we've got no transportation.\"\n\"The hydro...\"\n\"The magnetic pulse fried the electronics. I managed to get one of the engines working manually, but it's not going to get us anywhere I want to go. I was hoping, almost praying that you guys would be able to take care of yourselves without me. There were four of you! Did Harrison have a fucking army?!\"\nVlep shook his head, \"I don't...no he was alone.\"\n\"Then why'd he let you live?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"You didn't fight!\"\n\"I've never fired a gun in my...\"\nShe belted him across the face with the back of her hand, sending him sputtering to the ground as he held his face. He tried to take solace in the fact that at least now his cheeks would match.\n\"You're going to learn, Vlep. I'm going back to the hydrofoil to get the major. With luck, we should be able to drag Erestyl and Ambassador Kato to the intersection of the main highway. By the time we get there, I want a vehicle. I want it badly, and I don't care how get it. Understood?\"\nVlep nodded as she shoved a pistol, probably the major's, into his one free hand.\n\"Remember, I can kill you at any moment I choose. So a word of advice, Vlep. Don't think. Just do it.\"\nTangerine rays seeped quietly through the sliding, balcony window, its glassy surface coated with a thin, warm mist. Outside, the hot sun bathed the Sintrivani in a saffron orange glow as the afternoon slipped carelessly away like the shadows of children beneath a warm, golden fog.\nSpokes was baking peach and cranberry muffins, playing the spunky apprentice to Cecil's wizened if absent-minded mentor. Mike didn't much care about the respective roles or the protocols associated with each. All he knew was that he was about to be fed, and his stomach grumbled in anticipation.\nCecil seemed more interested in the dodec than the food, however. He kept turning it end over end, feeling its edges and especially the subtle crevices of its etching. It was in the shape of a songbird, a robin to be more precise, and in place of an eye and tip of a beak, there were two tiny ports of access. Spokes looked over occasionally, watching the blind man at work.\n\"You making progress?\"\n\"Found an inny and an outty.\"\nSpokes nodded, checking the muffins' state of readiness.\n\"Done.\"\nHe took them out, leaving them on the counter-top to cool while Mike watched the three-vee, its volume turned so low that it was barely audible. The Calannans had pin-pointed the source of the detonation to an Imperial owned sea vessel. Shortly after the initial announcement, there had been rioting in Xin, most of it aimed at neghrali-owned businesses, and the Imperial marine commander had declared Xekhasmeno a red zone, temporarily closing it off to air and ground traffic alike. Meanwhile, public officials alternately pleaded for calm or more often demanded explanations from the Imperial embassy. None were forthcoming, and even the Crimson Queen's orbiting convoy initiated alert status, temporarily refusing boarding to all but preferred passengers.\nMike switched the box off and rose to take a peek at the muffins. Spokes, ever protective of his alchemy, watched Mike with a suspicious smile.\n\"Just another cent, Harrison.\"\nMike reached into the cooler and had another gulp of guava. He sat back down beside Cecil. His old friend swiveled the cameras back and forth from dodec to gatherer.\n\"Dumb.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"We forgot to give our friend current inhibitors.\"\n\"They're not coming out of my salary,\" Spokes injected. The cameras turned toward him, zooms activating with an audible hum. Cecil smiled when he found what he was looking for.\n\"Good idea.\"\n\"No, Cecil. I just bought these.\"\n\"Lend to the gatherer. He needs them more than you.\"\n\"And what if he burns them out like my last pair?\"\n\"Better them than his grey muscle.\"\n\"That's debatable.\"\nSpokes carefully disconnected them, attaching them to Mike's jacks. Mike watched half doe-eyed, instinctively wanting to protect his scalp but also realizing that he had to keep his hands well out of the way lest Spokes should make a mistake. It made him feel small, and he smiled at his own helplessness.\n\"Are the muffins ready yet?\"\n\"No.\"\nMike suppressed a whine, and Cecil grinned knowingly.\n\"Let's see if we can make some hell in that head of yours, Michael. Go ahead and connect him.\"\nSpokes leaned over, collecting two of the four thin cords which curled from the dodec. Each merged with its neighbor near the point of no return. Cecil held two for himself as Spokes toyed with Mike's jacks, finally nodding agreeably as the translucent image of a mechanical combination lock appeared in front of Mike's face. From within its hazy background, Mike heard a woman's voice: \"Enter your clearance identification number.\" Cecil's grin widened as his cameras studied the look running across Mike's face. He handed Mike a flimsi. A long string of three digit numbers glowed pink upon its transparent surface.\n\"Lesson number one. Learn to think in directions.\"\nMike began turning the imaginary dial, each thrust of his mind sending it spinning.\n\"Easy now.\"\nAfter a few aborted attempts, he had the skill mastered. The dial twisted and turned as he imagined placing his hand upon it and rotating it gently. Finally it disappeared, and Mike saw her face, not an exact copy of the physical version, but an outline, deep blue eyes twinkling like distant stars and blonde hair waving back and forth in the electric static.\n\"Robin?\"\n\"User's access rejected. Security action two in progress.\"\n\"Robin, it's Mike Harrison.\"\n\"...Mike Harrison is not a legitimate user.\" A grey field of haze began to form between them, building like an ocean swell and threatening to engulf him.\n\"I'm with Johanes. We need your help.\"\nThe static foamed, spitting like acid as it washed over him. Then, just as suddenly, it disappeared. Mike blinked. The illusion of her face was no longer there. Instead, he saw Spokes fiddling with the connection, and once glance at the dodec told him it was all over. It was smoking, a vial of acidic chemicals released somewhere within its core.\n\"She was trying to fry you, dude. When she realized she couldn't, she just fried herself.\"\nCecil unplugged, a smile crossing his face as their team picture danced about the three-vee.\n\"Success,\" he drily announced.\"Time to scarf.\"\nThe muffins tasted even better than Mike had imagined, and Spokes served up bowls of sliced green apples immersed in chilled, sweet yogurt and topped with warm caramel and honey, finally gathering a bowl and a spare bottle of guava juice for himself before he slipped out the door.\n\"Where's Spokes going?\"\nCecil concentrated on his food, savoring every taste. Either that or he was savoring the captured data. Sometimes Mike found it hard to tell what his friend was thinking about.\n\"Cecil...\"\n\"He doesn't want to be here. He's afraid of knowledge and the danger it brings.\"\nMike nodded, \"And you aren't?\"\n\"When have you ever known Cecil to be scared of knowledge?\"\n\"You went in with me, didn't you.\"\n\"It was perfect, Michael. When you told her who you were...\" he chuckled.\n\"What did you find out?\"\n\"Enough. You provided an eon or more, after all. When you told her your name, she was...perplexed. A gatherer does not acquire such a combination. She had to think about whether or not she wanted to let you in. For an A.I., she was very hesitant.\"\n\"She decided to fry me in a matter of seconds.\"\n\"Yes, an eternity. The recon program was able to follow her hesitation and map logically where she looked for her decision. There was more than enough time to copy the gyroscopic logs. There was time to copy more.\" A camera lens bobbed up and down knowingly, \"If you dare to doubt...\"\nThe image of the team picture on the three-vee was suddenly replaced by a map of Xin. A red squiggly line zipped into the city, dashing directly to the hotel where Mike had been dumped by Cole. It continued to the Underway terminal, down to Xaos, and then back up again to Vilya's flat. Then it left the city and came back from another direction, finally darting to the Runyaelin, and then up to the Arien Mansion along the outskirts, before diving again off the map.\nCecil smiled, \"It knows where it goes.\"\n\"Can you zoom out? I want to see where it went before it got to Xin.\"\nCecil concentrated, and the city seemed to reduce in size, becoming a tiny dot at the center of the image.\n\"Curious. This can't be right. It comes from the water.\"\n\"Just map it.\"\nThe image continued to encompass still greater area as the line dived into the water from near Xekhasmeno and then darted back again.\nMike nodded, \"Okay, the point where it stops and turns around, how far away is that from ground zero.\"\n\"The nuke?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Less than a kilometer.\"\n\"Then that confirms it.\"\nThe image disappeared, and Cecil looked flustered.\n\"Confirms what?\"\n\"Johanes is paying you to find the local branch of ISIS, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, the information is obsolete. There is no ISIS headquarters anymore.\"\n\"What?! Why would they blow-up their own...\"\n\"Exactly. Johanes did it. He used me as bait and Nicholas as a sacrifice just to make it look genuine.\"\nCecil tilted his head, \"Explain.\"\n\"I was at Erfalas this morning. ISIS trailed me there, and they had what I first thought was the dodec. I knew they must have gotten it at the Tyberian Compound in Xekhasmeno. I just didn't know it was hand delivered courtesy of the Draconian S.S.\"\n\"Hence, your clutzery when he tossed it to you.\"\nMike nodded, \"Johanes didn't know whether or not I saw the Imps make off with it. For all he knew, I was dead or sleeping on the roof of some building and woke up when I heard the gun spray. When I showed up here, he had to find out one way or another.\"\n\"And you were a dead give away.\"\n\"Yeah. I just wasn't sure he got them where it counts. Now I am.\"\nCecil smiled, \"And the beauty of it is that he still doesn't know.\"\nMike winced.\n\"What?\"\n\"Cecil, you remember that locator that your friend found in my shoe two nights ago?\"\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\"How did he find it?\"\n\"Bug detector.\"\n\"You have one here?\"\nCecil dropped his jaw as the phone rang, and Mike shook his head, again disgusted with his own stupidity.\nJim Vassilakos (jimv@ucrmath.ucr.edu) just graduated from UCR with an MBA. In between responding to employment advertisements and attending Job Fairs, he DM's a hearty group of dormies and wonders how he's going to finish Harrison off once and for all.

The Draconian Chapter 12 seemed to read his mind from afar, sifting implications through the Copyright(c)1992 pours of Mike's skin.\"\nThe condo's comm-board continued to beep, muted light from the Sintrivani sketching dim lines across the white, plaster walls. Cecil curled his lip into an angry grimace.\n\"Great hindsight, gatherer.\"\n\"Just answer it.\" Mike added a t-cross with his finger and thumb, an old gatherer hand-sign, and one of the few which he remembered teaching Cecil. It usually meant \"track\" or \"follow\", but given the proper context, it could mean \"trace\". Cecil's cameras bobbed in comprehension as Johanes' image appeared on the three-vee, a slight nod displaying all the greetings he wished to convey.\nCecil snorted, \"Speak of the devil and he shalt come.\"\n\"Look, I don't have time to dance the verbal footsie with either of you. I know that you're probably tracing this call, so just stop me if I start getting long-winded.\"\nMike smiled, \"Fat chance.\"\n\"I'm calling on your behalf, Michael. I realize that right now you probably think that I'm lower than a swamp slog.\"\n\"You could have killed thousands of people, Johanes.\"\n\"But I didn't.\"\n\"And you tried to set me up. You sacrificed Nicholas. And for all you knew, that nuke could have gone off in the heart of Xin.\"\n\"All true.\"\nMike shook his head is disbelief, \"You don't even care.\"\n\"There's a lot at stake, Michael.\"\n\"Doomsday?\"\n\"I've already told you far too much.\"\n\"Now you have to kill me, I suppose?\" Mike grinned his baiting grin, waiting for anything that would keep Johanes on the line just a few moments longer. The Draconian seemed to read his mind from afar, sifting implications through the pours of Mike's skin. He took a deep breath.\n\"If I wasn't pressed for time, perhaps I would do the honors, but I imagine the Imps will do a far better job with you.\"\n\"Too bad. You could have done us all. Why didn't you?\"\n\"Just do yourself a favor, Michael. Get back to Tizar. Forget about this story. If you try publishing even half of what you know, it'll be the same as signing your own execution warrant.\"\n\"How many times have I heard that before?\"\n\"This isn't like the other stories. Don't give them a reason to pay you a visit. It's not worth it.\"\nHis face flickered off the depth box as the connection broke, and within a minute, Mike had dismembered the \"bug\" from its battery.\n\"Hmm... didn't self-destruct like the others. Did you trace him?\"\nCecil shook his head, \"He's a crafty one. He piggy-backed on a remote dialer. Could have found him, but he dropped the line before it became apparent.\"\n\"Damnit, Cecil! I had him on for how long?!\"\n\"Cecil be sorry.\" The camera's made a dejected pose. \"Got the last of it recorded from the remote if you're interested. Just didn't think to extend the trace in time.\"\n\"Great hindsight, hacker.\"\nThe camera nearest Mike perked sideways like a confused dog trying to see things from a slightly different perspective: Cecil's way of acknowledging a turn-about. However, something about its hound-like stance and the crumpled flimsi in his pants pocket told Mike the chase wasn't over. The comm-address glittered faintly as Mike flattened the flimsi out on the rug.\n\"Cecil, I just thought of something.\"\n\"Congratulations.\"\n\"Spokes managed to trace a call I made him from Gardansa's to a restricted comm-address.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"He was using amplitude logs or something. Can you do the same thing?\"\nThe camera seemed to shrug.\n\"That could take days.\"\n\"I bet you he's at the Arien mansion. Just compare the dialing records to the mansion and the immediate area around it.\"\nCecil half-sighed half-grumbled.\n\"He's not going to be that stupid, Michael. If he doesn't want you to find him, that's the last place he would go.\"\n\"Unless...\nCecil's cameras started rotating in victorious delight as Mike looked out the window toward Xin.\n\"...he has an good reason to be there. That was fast. He's inside the mansion, I take it?\"\n\"You aren't planning on going down there, are you?\" The cameras stopped rejoicing as Vilya's cat pawed at one of them, uncertain as to it's edibility.\n\"I'd like to know more about the Ariens themselves. They're playing some part in this, Cecil.\"\n\"And probably on both sides of the court, knowing how psyches are.\"\nMike smirked. It was like Cecil to understate the galaxy's most common prejudice just to needle him. He was probably baiting for the sort of reaction that could get them into an hours-long argument. Anything to waste time and keep Mike from going there. Cecil would simply consider it a friendly favor on his part.\n\"I'm going down there. I don't believe Johanes will carry out his threat.\"\n\"Well, then say hello to the rioters. Tell them you're a nice neghrali and maybe they won't hurt you either.\"\n\"I doubt I'll see any. Whatever unrest there is in Xin is not being directed against the Ariens.\"\n\"Oh really?\"\n\"Yeah, really.\"\n\"Anger, once sparked, burns a path toward the most opportunistic form of release, no matter how malign or misdirected.\"\n\"What idiot said that?\"\nThe quote flashed across the three-vee. Below it, \"Shattered Eden, Michael J. Harrison, Tyberian Publications.\" Mike scratched his head trying to figure out whether or not Cecil was pulling his leg.\n\"So I write a lot of stupid things. Big deal.\"\n\"What are you going to gain by going there?\"\n\"Maybe I'll be able to talk to Mr. Arien. I met him briefly, the last time I was here.\"\n\"Met him?\"\n\"Okay, Tara met him. I was there.\"\n\"Along for the ride.\"\n\"Yeah. All right. I don't really expect him to remember me, but if he does, it could be the break I need.\"\n\"Or break you don't need.\"\n\"You have a better idea?\"\nCecil shrugged, \"Investigate from afar. It's less dangerous.\"\n\"If I had access to Cindy, I would.\"\n\"SNDI? Supernatural Data, Incorporated? You've got it, Michael. What did you think the Doggie Blitz ran on? Punch cards?\"\nMike tried to formulate an appropriate response as Cecil taught him how to hook into the phone jack. From what he gathered, higher brain functions were off-limits to all save the super-users or \"wizards\" as they were called. Mike considered calling the favor, but he figured that lower-brain would be just fine as long as he could avoid running into snags. Cecil retired to the balcony. Outside, the warm, jetting waters of the Sintrivani carried a late evening crowd high above the dispersed illumination save for the few strands of blue and purple laser light captured within the misty fog.\n\"Woof!\"\nMike jumped slightly, though the cat seemed neither to notice nor care. The noise was in his head, no more than an electrical illusion.\n\"Access. File. Information. Library. Galactic Press.\"\n\"...Woof!\"\n\"Does that mean...\"\n\"Woof!\"\n\"Damnit.\"\n\"...Woof!\"\n\"Access. File. System. Output parameters. Errors. Command. Set format. Long.\"\n\"...Pant pant.\"\nMike rubbed the side of his face. For a moment, he could almost smell wet, sticky, dog breath.\n\"Very funny.\"\n\"...Woof! Illegal command ignored.\"\n\"Access. File. System. Output parameters. Errors. Command. Ignore. Keyword woof.\"\n\"...Pant pant.\"\n\"Access. File. System. Output messages. Command. Galanglicize. Message. Most recent.\"\n\"...Done.\"\n\"Access. Userlog. Current. Command. Find. Username. Spokes.\"\n\"...Done.\"\n\"Query. Date. Login through logout. Most recent.\"\n\"...Insufficient format specification.\"\n\"Tora-centric. Positive past. Unit centim. Single decimal.\"\n\"96.2 through 71.9.\"\nMike looked out the window wondering what Spokes was up to. The evening was hacker time, and Spokes had been gone long enough to make it back to Xekhasmeno. Long enough to get pulled off the road and molested by locals, Mike figured.\nCecil was leaning back in a lounge chair, luxuriating in his abstinence from the electronic environs as thin layers of warm mist settled over him and the gleeful screams of children resounded in the distance. He used to say that he needed the condo to get away from it all. Then, when he was rested, he'd go back into a little cubicle somewhere and not be seen for days or weeks. It didn't make a great deal of sense to Mike, but then a lot of things didn't make much sense. He hoped that Spokes had the same idea. Better isolation than dislocation.\n\"Access. File. Information. Library. The Aggressor. Interstellar society page. Command. Search. Keyword Arien.\"\n\"...Insufficient file specification.\"\n\"Most recent.\"\n\"...Done.\"\n\"Say file.\"\n\"...Incompatible format error.\"\n\"Show file.\"\nA page of the local paper appeared in glowing blue Calannic in front of Mike's face. Even blinking his eyes refused to dislodge it, and whoever scanned it into memory hadn't bothered to reduce it into text. Instead, it was simply an image with a list of keywords attached to it. Sloppy but cost-efficient.\nAs he began to scan the first few lines, Mike realized that the article wasn't about the Arien family at all, but he instantly recognized the picture. Long, dark hair fell straight along her spine, her sharp, brown eyes watching the row of black grav-limos rising from a well manicured lawn. The color of the cars clashed against her white evening dress, her shoulders bare save for the reflection of headlights on deep, bronzed skin. In the background, a crowd of people were escaping the Lion's Den. Mike remembered the awards ceremony all too well. The headline read, \"Draconian Ambassador Disappears.\"\n\"Cecil!\"\n\"...Illegal command ignored.\"\n\"Command. Pause.\"\nCecil poked his head in.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"I got something. How do I display this on the three-vee?\"\nCecil strolled in, unplugging Mike and plugging himself in with two swift motions of his wrist. The image appeared on the depth box a moment later.\n\"You know her?\"\nMike nodded, \"I met her at an awards banquet just before coming to Calanna. It looks like this image was taken just after it.\"\n\"How did this turn up?\"\n\"It says she was married to...\"\nMike read the paragraph again, still shaking off his disbelief.\n\"...Alister Arien. An unnamed source in the Draconian Embassy blamed the DSS. I don't believe this.\"\n\"Good. The written word is rarely worth believing.\"\n\"Why would they kidnap their own ambassador?\"\n\"Cloak and dagger stuff. Conspiracy of hate. You know how it is.\"\nMike looked up incredulously. His old friend wore a fool's grin, the sort he'd throw on for guests he was planning on throwing out. Mike stood up, stepping toward the door.\n\"You don't buy any of this, do you.\"\n\"It's a local rag, Michael. The Aggressor rarely prints anything worth reading beyond its entertainment value. Too bad Doggie Blitz doesn't carry The Galactican. But then we'd have to deal with those silly writers' royalties, not to mention all varieties of interstellar propaganda.\"\nMike winced, \"I'm not biting, Cecil. I have to get to the Arien mansion.\"\n\"You already know Cecil's opinion.\"\n\"That I'm being hideously stupid?\"\nThe nearest camera nodded, and Cecil sighed.\n\"Before you go, there's something more you should know.\"\n\"Such as?\"\n\"Found something interesting while sifting through the booty from that android brain.\"\n\"Robin?\"\n\"She had some very peculiar orders, Michael. Orders which she had to consult before deciding to fry you. She was to kill you and Niki upon touch down and then report to her temporary supervisor for further instructions.\"\n\"Clay?\"\n\"A chap by the name of William Walker.\"\nMike blinked, \"Bill?\"\n\"One and the same.\"\n\"That doesn't make sense.\"\n\"If she recognized him and he had the proper access code, then he could have gotten inside just like we did tonight. Judging from these orders, he could have gotten further.\"\n\"Why would Clay turn her over to Bill? Why would he send us on this mission just to kill us?\"\nCecil smiled, \"A change of plans, perhaps? Now, at least, you and Johanes might have something interesting to talk about. Give the Draconian Cecil's warmest regards. Translation: if he blinks, fry him.\"\nEvening descended into night as Mike approached the outskirts of Xin, his impatience forcing a speed well beyond the limits proscribed by Calannan law. Judging from the radio reports, however, he wouldn't have to worry about being pulled over. The police were most likely busy in the inner city, quelling the incessant looting and vandalism.\nHe'd seen riots before. Even in his early youth, he'd learned what to expect. What made \"Shattered Eden\" a success wasn't so much the accurate description of such events. It was the human nature that got people, the law of opportunism as Cecil might have called it. To Mike, it was just sloth.\nPeople liked to take the easy out in nearly all endeavors whether they were flagellating their brains in the electronic void or expressing rage at things they only barely understood. Even the grand Imperial bureaucracy which sought to destroy an entire world had shied away from the big bang approach. Too messy, they must have figured: bad for interstellar relations. Germ warfare had been far easier for them, far less newsworthy.\nThese locals were no different. Mike knew they would try to hit the obvious targets. But unlike Eden, the two most obvious targets, the Arien mansion and Xekhasmeno, were both out of the way and very defensible. The Calannans could fume and fuss, destroy small businesses, even kill a few unfortunates. But if they wanted to make the sort of statement worth making, they'd have to take casualties. Mike suspected that few rioters would be so inclined, because at heart, those most indolent were often the most cowardly.\nThus, the Arien mansion resembled not so much a war zone as a refugee camp. Bathed in the moon's faint luminescence, a quarrelsome throng resided outside the front gates, tossing occasional molotovs onto the lawn and shouting threats into the studded darkness. Mike parked at the side of the road among the other vehicles and started circling the mansion grounds on foot to glean some idea of his chances. He guessed that the direct approach would likely constitute a recipe for suicide, as just outside the moat, he could discern the movement of clumsy shapes in the darkness: a row of Alister's mutated minions most probably. He could imagine the worgs wearing hungry grins, the sort normally reserved for career bureaucrats and used grav-car dealers named \"Slim-price Sam\".\nHalf way around, he spotted the yellow motorbike. It sat beside a row of shrubs on the near side of the moat, plainly visible from the fence but hidden from the mansion itself. Mike figured that either Johanes was taking half-hearted precautions or he was planning a swift get-away. Another step yielded sudden pain from below. Several thick cords of barbed wire lay strewn about, one snagged on his bare foot. Mike knelt down, tearing it loose with a determined yank. Someone had cut it off the top of the gate, motion sensors and all, and a new wire was strung loosely between the severed ends carrying electricity from one side to the other but skipping the portion in between. Mike climbed up and over, smearing blood on the cermelicon rails and finally settling himself on estate grounds just inside the gate.\nAs though on cue, the noise of gun spray cracked through the air. Mike froze, huddling into a ball before he realized that he wasn't a target. The gun towers were firing on the front gates as gas canisters exploded in the crowd's midst. Though nearly half a kilometer distant, Mike could still see the gates open, cermelicon railings reflecting the moonlight as they slid to the side allowing the worgs to charge through. It was a slaughter, pure and simple, and those who couldn't make it back to their vehicles were chewed up and left to rot on the blood stained pavement.\nMike picked himself off the grass, the moments ticking in his mind with each heartbeat in his ears as he began bolting toward the mansion. Every stride ate precious time, but with all attention focused on the front gate, Mike skidded to a halt beside Johanes' bike having apparently attracted no notice whatsoever. The bike's motor idled quietly, its noise muffled by a black, plastic jacket. A long, insulated tube extended from the jacket, running to the moat beneath the shrubbery. It was a cooling sheath, Mike guessed, keeping the bike both quiet and invisible to infra-red sensors as well as protecting it from overheating.\nReaching up, Mike gently switched off the motor and pocketed the key, glancing toward the moat as though it were an after- thought, a fifteen meter wide after-thought with gun towers looming overhead and tales of a moat monster fully appreciated. Still, the mansion walls beckoned, and Mike knew he'd never have a better chance. The water was warm and mucky, its thin layer of brown surface jelly sending memories of Aiwelk tumbling about in his head. Holding the automatic pistol overhead, Mike tried wading across but sunk into the deep, slimy mud along the moat's banks. He finally resorted to lodging the barrel between his teeth and dog paddling like a mad man.\nLeafy, moist vegetation hugged the mansion's stone walls amidst a tapestry of drab moss which dipped gently into the water. The thin vines were surprisingly strong, and Mike found himself climbing upward toward the second floor windows when he felt an annoying tug at his legs. The moat had extruded a long, grey tentacle which had wrapped a determined hold around his ankles.\n\"Good evening, Mister Harrison. So good of you to drop by.\"\nMike nearly fell off the wall, his mud caked hand frozen just inches from his mouth. The voice came from the nearest gun tower. He could see Mr. Arien's head sticking from a window one floor above him, his sparse, silver hair glittering in the dim moonlight. Johanes stood beside the old man, a dour grimace painted across the Draconian's lips. The barrel of a rifle poked out an adjacent window, its laser sights cutting a fine beam of light through the damp air between it and the back of Mike's neck.\n\"At a loss for words?\"\nMike spat, propelling the pistol from his mouth into the murky water below. The grey tentacle immediately retreated back beneath the surface either in response to some unseen command or in order to examine its new, metallic visitor.\n\"That's better.\" Someone handed Arien a flimsi. \"Let's see what we have on you. Mmmm... juicy. You've been up to mischief, young man?\"\n\"A little. Can I come inside?\"\n\"Just hang out.\"\nMike gripped two vines and stayed put, the thought of diving back into the moat playing back and forth between his brain lobes. Leaning over slightly, Johanes seemed to whisper something into Arien's ear.\n\"Kill him?! Our first truly determined trespasser in how many years?\" Johanes winced and gritted his teeth as the old man continued. \"Mr. Harrison, being that I am expecting company rather soon, I don't have a great deal of time to chit-chat, so you'll have to be brief. Why shouldn't I blast you off my walls like the bug you are, and more importantly, why does your Draconian friend want me to?\"\n\"To your first question: Ambassador Kato. To your second: he's not my friend.\" Mike bit his lip, half expecting to become a late night morsel for the moat creature. Arien, however, seemed to frown in consideration.\n\"Bring him up.\"\nThe rope was easier to climb than wall carpet, and Mike accepted the invitation with a healthy tug. Inside, Johanes and Arien were surrounded by a number of guards, each wearing black body armor and carrying automatic rifles with electronic sights. Perfect for sniping the locals, Mike figured, though a bit long ranged for disposing of nosy gatherers.\n\"Do not be afraid, Mr. Harrison. I have no intention of killing you so long as you speak the truth. Where is she?\"\nMike gulped down, trying to conjure the knowledge as Johanes answered for him.\n\"You're wasting your time. He knows nothing. If you refuse to punish him directly, Alister, at least turn him over to the police.\"\n\"Silence, Draconian. I wish to hear what he has to say.\"\nMike looked back toward the open window. Muddy footprints left his trace easily visible. He shook his arms off, finally turning toward Arien with a discouraged shrug.\n\"I don't know where she is. The last time I saw the Ambassador was on Tizar. She wanted me to come here to Calanna.\"\n\"To do what?\"\n\"To die, apparently, or so Robin said.\"\n\"Robin?\"\nJohanes stepped between them, \"We don't have time for this nonsense, Alister. Sule will be arriving with the Ambassador and Erestyl at any moment.\"\nMike squinted, \"Sule? ISIS?\"\n\"Stay out of this, Michael.\"\n\"ISIS is coming here?! What, their mind scanners didn't work, so you're cooperating?\" Mike gazed, incredulously.\n\"I'm warning you...\"\n\"No. No, you're not. You want Sule. One bullet, and it'll be over. You're aware of the nuclear detonation today, Mr. Arien?\"\n\"Michael!\"\n\"There's a fair chance that the Ambassador was at ground zero. You already know that I'm wanted by the police for homicide. Well Johanes here isn't wanted for anything, and it's very likely that he's guilty of murdering your wife.\"\n\"Michael, we're not playing games here! Your fantasies will have to find another audience.\"\n\"Why the fast getaway, Johanes? You planning to just kill and run?\"\n\"I have no intention of running.\"\nJohanes drew a pistol from his coat, an integral laser pistol to be more exact. It's polished iridium handle made it look more like a hood ornament than a weapon, however, with it aimed between his eyes, Mike didn't doubt its lethal competence. Given the proper setting, he'd seen such devices carve holes in flesh so neatly, they could cauterize the wounds they inflicted before spilling a single drop of blood. He guessed that Johanes had been saving this weapon for a special occasion and tried to feel honored.\n\"No!\"\nThe voice was Arien's, and Johanes obeyed it, if only for a moment.\n\"Alister...\"\n\"Put it down.\"\n\"I am politely asking your permission to kill this liar.\"\n\"Put it down or be punctured.\"\nNearly every automatic rifle in the room pointed toward the Draconian, the glint of steel wary with expectation as three of the guards crouched down at the corners to avoid the cross fire. It was the sort of threat that would be carried out with neither postponement nor afterthought, and Mike watched, silent and breathless, as Johanes, wavering with indecision, reluctantly complied.\n\"Restrain him.\"\n\"Of for... there's no need to...\"\n\"Remain still, Johanes. I do not wish to see you damaged. Please continue, Mr. Harrison. Your hypothesis intrigues me.\"\nMike sat down on the window sill, oblivious for once to the squashing sound of his muddy pants. He imagined falling backwards into the moat, nose cartilage sunken deep within his skull and Johanes' boot print embedded firmly upon his face. Johanes was thinking it too. His eyes betrayed him, if not his fists or the veins in his neck. Throat dry with expired fear, Mike swallowed a warm drop of saliva and blinked in consideration of where to begin.\n\"It's no longer hypothetical.\"\nMike withdrew the key from his pocket.\n\"Your fence has a hole in it. Just across the moat you'll find Johanes' bike. There's a cooling sheath wrapped around the motor. That he was planning a quick escape was obvious. I just couldn't figure out why. Now I can. If Sule is coming here with Erestyl, it means that the mind scanner wasn't a success. They need a telepath to get inside his head. Somebody good. Like you. Am I right?\"\n\"Continue.\"\n\"However, you've never worked for Imperials, at least not to my knowledge, and according to Kitara, you have as much reason to hate them as I do.\"\nArien's eyes sparkled at his recollection of the Siri.\n\"You knew Kitara?\"\n\"Very well. You probably don't remember me, but we've met before. A year ago. She told me a few things about you. If you're working for the Imps, you must have a very good reason. That's where Ambassador Kato comes in. ISIS has her. Just stop me if I'm wrong.\"\n\"You're right.\"\n\"Are you're certain she's still alive?\"\nArien looked down, drawing a deep breath. \"No. However, as long as the possibility remains...\"\n\"You'll do anything for anyone. And Johanes here, he's to deal with Sule as soon as the Ambassador is safe. To let Imperial blood fall on Draconian hands. Pardon my candor, Mr. Arien, but you're a fool.\"\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\"Did Johanes explain to you what's at stake?\"\n\"He didn't have to. I've known of the Prometheus device for some time.\"\n\"Prometheus device?\"\nArien glanced toward Johanes, his eyes betraying a mixture of uncertainty and solicitation.\n\"He doesn't know?\"\nJohanes shook his head, \"I was trying to protect him from the details.\"\nMike broke in, \"What about this Prometheus device?\"\n\"It's like one of those weapons we were talking about, Mike, the kind that kill en masse. Only this one gives en masse a whole new definition.\"\n\"Doomsday?\"\n\"You don't want to know the details. Trust me.\"\n\"What makes you so sure?\"\n\"Because... if you publish so much as a peep, you're dead meat.\"\n\"The Imps already want to kill me, Jo, and at least one member of the DSS seems to feel the same way.\"\nJohanes smiled, \"I don't want to kill you, Mike. I want to throttle you, and then I want to kill you.\"\n\"Oh, thanks. That makes me feel so much better.\"\n\"Don't take it personally. I want to do likewise with Alister here.\"\n\"Now is not a good time to be threatening me, Johanes.\"\n\"You think I give a damn? You think I'm in this for my jollies like Mike here? Tell me something, Alister. Even assuming that Sule's telling the truth and Kato is somehow still alive, heaven forbid that should be the case, but just supposing it is... tell me something. Is she worth it? Doomsday for a single human life?\"\nArien looked insulted, then confused, then finally a mixture of the two.\n\"How am I supposed to answer that?\"\n\"Don't answer it. Just think about it. It's not too late. We can still turn this thing around. All I'm asking for is one clear shot. I'll take Sule out like a can of garbage. We'll have Erestyl. We'll find your wife, if she's still alive. Just trust me. For one lousy night, trust me.\"\n\"If I let you kill Sule...\"\n\"I know what you're going to say, Alister, and she's already dead... or worse than dead. Why the hell can't you see that?! You know what ISIS does to captives like her.\"\n\"Mental mutilation.\"\n\"That's right. She'll be a zombie, Alister. You'll be trading the secret of Promethius for a zombie. Think it over.\"\n\"I have already,\" He looked toward Mike as he announced the decision, not so much at him as through him, and strange it may seem, Mike found himself frozen, unable to turn aside from the tone of finality in the old man's voice, unable to blink from the sight of his eyes nor even shut his mind to the message they contained. It was as though Alister had seen something in him, a fragment of thought, a whisp of spirit, or even a moment of future destiny. Whatever it was, he counted on it, settling more weight upon its value that Mike cared to ascertain. And then Alister turned away, the moment lost in the shuffle of a heartbeat.\n\"As you perhaps know, Johanes, there are ways of repairing such injuries given the proper precautions, and Draconians are, generally speaking, very cautious people. I'd thought I'd convinced you to bide your time, to wait for the right moment, however, it seems that you have reverted to your original idea. Kill her at the first opportunity, and leave old Alister to pick up the pieces. Who can tell why? Perhaps you expected that the right moment would never come, that it was stolen by things that go boom in the daytime.\"\n\"Nuke?\" Mike queried.\nArien nodded, \"I'd always known it was a fitting nick-name. Her temper was rather explosive. But if I'd known what would be her end...\"\n\"Both Sule and Erestyl apparently survived.\"\n\"Regardless, this Draconian filth tried to sacrifice her like some...\"\n\"I know what I did! I'm not pleased about it anymore than you, but I'd do it again, and you know damn well the reason!\"\n\"Yes, of course. You were just being cautious.\"\nA small, metallic sphere floated in through the door, a red light flashing at its zenith.\n\"Speak.\"\n\"Sule has arrived, my lord. She is outside the front gate awaiting permission to enter.\"\n\"Grant it. Guards, make our guests comfortable.\"\nArien left, bequeathing his private soldiers with a simple if indefinite task. Mike stood back, smiling ever so slightly as Johanes was physically searched in the most comprehensive manner allowable by law. Being that Calannan law was rather lax on such matters, he had some time to wait and wonder if he was to be their next victim. Several minutes later, they found themselves in a basement cell, Johanes wearing a towel one of Arien's more generous employees had loaned him. He stood in the cell's corner, feet together and legs slightly bent, the white towel knotted around his waist. Mike tried to churn forth a wholesome expression.\n\"Did it hurt?\"\nJohanes merely gritted his teeth in response, angry eyes glaring stubbornly at the opposite wall. Mike nodded, trying to look sympathetic.\n\"I'm just asking, because if you think you need a proctologist or anything...\"\n\"Shut-up, Harrison.\"\n\"Right... um,\" Mike paused, searching for the right words, \"Do you mind if I ask you a question?\"\nJohanes ignored him, wincing as he shifted his weight slightly.\n\"Were you really going to shoot me back there?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You were.\"\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\"May I ask why?\"\nJohanes snorted and then winced again as the vibration crawled down along his spine. Mike looked away, granting him some private latitude for expression of discomfort.\n\"I mean, it's a little extreme, isn't it? To shoot somebody?\"\n\"Why don't you ask Bill Walker.\"\n\"Where did you hear about that?\"\n\"Various places. Before the operation you were telling Cecil all about it.\"\nMike shook his head, \"Then you heard it was self-defense, and Bill was a friend.\"\n\"A friend, perhaps. As for self-defense, I understand that he was unarmed.\"\n\"I had no choice.\"\n\"Precisely. You were protecting your own precious hide from an unarmed friend as you put it. I, on the other hand, am trying to protect millions of people.\"\nMike smiled, \"Let me get this straight. You pull out a laser with every intention of carving holes in me, and two cents later you're calling my morality into question?\"\n\"You got it. Oh, and by the way, I didn't have the heart to tell you this before, but you'll probably figure it out sooner or later. Your friend was working for the Imps, true enough, but he didn't know it until it was too late. He thought he was working for the DSS, for John Clay to be more precise. He didn't really know what he'd gotten himself into until Sule came prancing along.\"\nMike stared back incredulously, the smile wiped from his face as thoroughly as if he'd been hit by a ton of bricks. Johanes simply nodded and continued.\n\"ISIS found out about Erestyl being on Tizar when Clay, one of our boys, decided he was getting a lousy deal from the agency. He cleverly diverted our internal investigations after the raid on the med-center by shifting the blame for Erestyl's capture to you. Then he disappeared, and that disk you stole from the Solomon mansion... that disk you left in Walker's hands... it became extremely valuable to ISIS. I don't know whether Clay told your friend what to expect from Robin upon reaching Calanna or whether he just figured it out by himself, but either way, Walker saved your life, and you repaid him by blowing a hole through his chest. Why, if it wasn't for your juvenile curiosity combined with those amazing trigger-happy reflexes, your friend would still be alive.\"\nMike held his breath for a moment to keep from bolting to his feet. Getting into a fight with Johanes was not something he would let himself be talked into.\n\"You're twisting it, Jo. He was with Sule. He was trying to get me captured by ISIS.\"\n\"For questioning. My guess is that he figured that you knew just about nothing regarding Erestyl. Sule probably promised him that you'd be set free, and who knows, you might very well have been at that point. You were still blissfully ignorant, and you'd already done them a great service. You played right into their trap, after all.\"\n\"You don't honestly believe that.\"\n\"What you or I believe isn't particularly important. It's what Bill believed that is interesting. You wrote him off as a traitor without even bothering to attend the funeral. When the locals got around to doing an autopsy on the body, they found the primary arteries in his neck already shattered. The culprit was a tiny capsule with its own radio receiver, timing mechanism, and explosive charge courtesy of ISIS. Their leverage over him, Michael. Your friend knew that he'd made a huge mistake. He knew that you were in the process of making another similar mistake, and he wanted to get you out of the picture as quickly and as painlessly as possible, even if it meant handing you over to the Imps. As far as he was concerned, they'd catch you sooner or later.\"\n\"The psyche bloodhound?\"\nJohanes nodded, \"A gift from Alister. Before the Imps admitted to having Ambassador Kato, they had Clay pay Alister a social call. Clay, I am told, was very convincing in blaming Kato's capture on rogue elements in the DSS. He requested psychic assistance in tracking her down.\"\n\"Arien couldn't see through it?\"\n\"Clay has a psionic shield implant.\"\n\"You're reaching, Jo.\"\n\"If you don't believe me, the why don't you look at his file. I'm sure Cecil could supply it now that he's virtually jumped Robin's bones.\"\n\"She doesn't have any bones, and I'm not buying any of this.\"\n\"Her circuits then, and yes you are. Because it's true, and you know it.\"\nMike took a deep breath. \"Why are you telling me this?\"\nJohanes shrugged, \"Because, it's as close to throttling you as I'm likely to get... at least in this lifetime. You may not realize it yet, Michael, but you're not long for this world.\"\n\"Sule doesn't even know I'm here.\"\n\"If Vlep lives, she knows.\"\n\"Vlep?\"\n\"The psyche bloodhound.\"\nMike winced, \"He lives.\"\nJohanes cocked his head sideways, \"What makes you so certain?\"\n\"I hand-cuffed him to a steering wheel this morning.\"\nJohanes coughed, \"You what?\"\n\"It's a bit of a story.\"\n\"We seem to have a bit of spare time.\"\nDespair curled about the corridor like knotted strands of raw meat, a nourishing meal, though people rarely gobbled it with enthusiasm. Pausing, she carefully rested her hand upon the stone tile. Johanes and several of the guards had passed recently. Remnants of their emotions lay scattered carelessly, and yet there was more, the gatherer she had yet to meet. He was neither angry nor dutiful. Instead, he seemed relieved, as though being jailed in the mansion's dungeon had been more reprieve than punishment. Why Sule had requested him, she could scarcely imagine. The bio-synthe was difficult to read. So many of them turned out deranged, trying to establish a telepathic rapport was rarely worth the effort.\nMixtures of fear and respect pressed quickly away as the guards stepped aside to let her pass, and with a slight motion of her thumb, the one at the end opened the tall, brown door. Its metal plating was rusty with age, and its grey, galvorn lock jutted out conspicuously like some misbehaved organ. Inside, Johanes leaned against a wall as the gatherer sat on the bench, looking up cautiously, his eyes keen and brown, a web of fear swept over whatever curiosity still lingered.\n\"Korina?\" Johanes pressed against the bars. \"Kori... tell me you've come to let me out of here.\"\n\"In your dreams, Draconian. Father sent me for the gatherer.\"\nShe watched the figure on the bench. He stood slowly, naked save for a pair of mud-caked britches. Turning, Johanes slumped his shoulders.\n\"Sule wants him, eh? We'd already assumed as much.\"\n\"Get out of the way.\"\nJohanes complied, escalating Mike forward with a swift boot to the back.\n\"Go ahead, Michael. And good fortune. You'll need it.\"\nMike let himself be escorted down the corridor. Two guards stayed behind them, their rifles ready for a moment's distraction. The young woman at his side seemed to ignore them, her green eyes lost in a dreamy haze. As they passed a row of windows, he considered making a break for it. To die with bullets in his back or bullets in his front, it made little difference. Even the gullet of the strange moat creature seemed preferable to a meeting with Sule. Green eyes watched him from the corners of their vision.\n\"Don't be afraid. As long as you are here, my father will see to your safety.\"\nMike nodded doubtfully, the poke of a muzzle nudging his spine.\n\"And what about Erestyl?\"\n\"He is Imperial property.\"\n\"Oh,\" Mike gulped, \"so that's how it works.\"\nShe stopped in the antechamber before the sanctuary. Mike remembered the mauve carpet and indigo tapestries all too well. Tara had been ignoring him the night of their visit, so he'd wandered around until he was sure he was lost, eventually winding up in the meditation chamber with his head poked out a window, sky-diving snot wads and half-nibbled hors d'oeuvres on the patrolling worgs. She found him after a few direct hits, apparently aware of some bizarre sense of satisfaction he was feeling and curious as to its source. They ended up spending half the night there before the servants finally kicked them out. Green eyes stared through him, her expression lingering in the grey stretch between curiosity and bewilderment. Mike looked back at the floor and consciously cleared his mind.\n\"My thoughts are my property.\"\nShe opened her mouth as if to respond and then shut it again. Mike regarded her indecision with contempt.\n\"If you have something to say, say it.\"\n\"I was curious as to why she wants you.\"\n\"Sule? Why don't you read her like you did me?\"\n\"She...\" green eyes narrowed, \"it is difficult.\"\n\"Must really stink to have a puzzle, eh?\"\n\"I'll survive.\"\nMike let his annoyance fade into a mediocre smirk. \"Are we going in or not?\"\nShe thumped the base of her palm against the door, the resulting sound dull but determined, and as though by its own volition, the wooden barrier slid quietly into the wall. Sule stood at arm's reach, her silver-hued eyes glinting with the barest trace of anger.\nMike gulped down, \"You called?\"\nJim Vassilakos (jimv@ucrmath.ucr.edu) just graduated from UCR with an MBA. In between responding to employment advertisements and attending Job Fairs, he DM's a hearty group of dormies and wonders how he's going to finish Harrison off once and for all. Judging his protagionist's current situation, he may not have to wonder for very long.\n`The Harrison Chapters' will be continued next issue.","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

And good riddance.' Then she broke into a by Jim Vassilakos sprint, and Mike heard the sound of gunfire. He hit the turf, Chapter 13 holding Kato down as bullets continued to whiz overhead.\" Copyright (c) 1993\nShe stood before him, silent and expressionless as subtle strands of moonlight bathed the sanctuary in dim shades of purple. Then a coy smile played into her silver eyes, and her white mane rippled in the icy darkness, hair like blades, etching an icy trail along his throat. Her nails left only a thin trickle of blood, barely a distraction, one following closely upon the other in preparation for her knee's decisive collision with his crotch. He doubled over, falling to the floor with a heavy thud and torn, mud-caked britches.\n\"Out of the frying pan and into the fire, eh Harrison? That was for making a fool of me. This is for trying to nuke me.\"\nHer palm pressed against his nose, two fingers slowly but resolutely forcing their way into his eye sockets.\n\"I didn't do it.\"\nShe held the pressure for a moment and then changed her grip on his face, lifting him to the wall by the scruff of his chin.\n\"I was going to kill you mercifully, but lies piss me off.\"\n\"He's not lying.\" The voice belonged to green-eyes.\nSule rocked Mike back a foot and then bounced him off the wall, dropping him to the mauve carpet like a wet rag. He was still shaking off stars as Sule turned toward Arien's daughter.\n\"Get out!\"\n\"What are you going to do, Sule? Beat me up?\" The young woman stepped forward, confidence filling every movement. \"If you touch me, my father will kill you, and if you touch him, I'll kill you.\"\nMike raised his head slowly and blinked, the gleam of moonlight off iridium scarcely catching his notice. She had Johanes's laser. An appropriate weapon, Mike figured. With nothing mechanical to slow her down, it shaved the bio-synthe's edge to a bare minimum. Sule's scowl faded slightly, a touch of amusement sparking silver eyes.\n\"You are a foolish girl.\"\n\"And you're on my turf, Sule. Don't forget it.\"\nMike raised himself halfway off the floor, taking a wider surveillance of the chamber. Erestyl's emaciated body lay folded in a corner, his eyes staring at nothing in particular. Mike crept over, fumbling in vain for a pulse and finding a spent hypo on the floor.\n\"He outlived his usefulness,\" Sule contemplated. \"The reason you came to this space sick planet is dead.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Efficiency.\"\nMike coughed, \"Efficiency?\"\n\"With the aid of Korina and Alister, his mind was peeled open such that I could question him in solitude. After he disclosed the details of his treachery, there was simply nothing more of value to learn from him. Now all that remains is to dispose of the body, a matter to which I must personally attend.\"\nWith that she picked up the body and carried it out the door. Mike followed her, still limping, outside and across the moat's narrow bridge. Outside, the Worgs guarded the mansion, their hungry eyes perched upon blood-drenched snouts. Sule dropped the body several feet from the moat, placing a small vial on Erestyl's chest and breaking it with her boot. A moment later, the body was consumed in flame, and several of the Worgs took up a mournful howl. She waited a minute, finally kicking the charred remains into the water.\n\"Food for your pet, Alister.\"\nMike turned around. Arien stood behind him with Korina by his side. He seemed despondent, light from the dying flames flickering in his eyes.\n\"The first cooked meal she's had in years.\"\n\"You're sure you won't let me take this gatherer with me? I'd rather like to keep him.\"\nArien smiled, \"If it wasn't for Mr. Harrison, Sule, it might be your burnt corpse in that moat.\"\nHer eyes narrowed, but she never got to respond. A gravcar slipped casually over the gate, turning back only as the laser cannon opened with a warning burst. Arien raised his arm, effectively restraining further damage to his lawn.\n\"Your ride, I take it?\"\nSule nodded, \"Vlep and your wife. You want her, you'll have to fetch her.\"\n\"Mr. Harrison?\"\nMike looked at him dumbly. \"Don't you have guards to do that sort of thing?\"\n\"Please, Mr. Harrison. Oh, you'll need this.\"\nHe handed Mike some hi-tech gizmo, a makeshift medical scanner if Mike guessed correctly.\n\"To check for anything physically out of the ordinary. It's been pre-programmed. All you have to do is hit this button. Easy enough for you?\"\nMike was about to say no, but the look in Korina's green eyes told him not to bother. The front gate was wide open, and crossing through it, Mike saw Vlep in the driver's seat.\n\"Long time, no see.\"\n\"Why are they sending you?\"\nMike shrugged, \"I'm sure he has his reasons.\"\nAmbassador Kato was in the back seat, her brown eyes glassy and sluggish. Mike opened her door, and began scanning. The gizmo seemed to say she was okay, and he offered his hand in what he figured was his most diplomatic gesture of the evening.\n\"C'mon Ambassador.\"\nHe reached in and shook her shoulder, finally getting some figment of attention.\n\"Mind scanner?\"\nVlep ignored the query.\n\"It's okay, Vlep. Sule can't hear you.\"\n\"You'd be surprised.\"\n\"Oh,\" Mike nodded, \"she's got a vice on your balls does she?\"\n\"In my neck.\"\nMike made a T-sign, turning the scanner toward Vlep.\n\"You know what that means, don't you?\"\nVlep looked up, somewhat confused.\n\"You're just gonna have to do what you do best, Vlep.\"\nMike leaned in, grabbing Vlep's hand and pressing it against his forehead.\n\"Understand?\"\nHe picked Johanes' bug out of his pocket, screwing the two pieces back together. Then he dropped it in Vlep's hand.\n\"It's the only chance you've got.\"\nMike lifted the ambassador from the vehicle and pointed her in the direction of the mansion. She leaned against him as they walked, and he felt as though he were training a baby to put one foot in front of the other. They met Sule half way across the lawn. Her white mane waved gently in the cool, night air, and she held a small metallic cylinder in one hand, its tip gleaming golden in the moonlight.\n\"Goodbye, Harrison. And good riddance.\"\nThen she broke into a sprint, and Mike heard the sound of gunfire. He hit the turf, holding Kato down as bullets continued to whiz overhead. Then all was silent, and the gravcar was gone. Mike picked himself unsteadily off the lawn, helping the Ambassador to her feet. Korina was there moments later, her father trotting close behind.\n\"Thank the fates. We thought you both dead.\"\n\"Vlep's no marksman, but all the same, it's amazing that he missed,\" Arien added.\nMike shook his head and started back toward the mansion.\n\"He didn't miss.\"\nMike leaned against the tile wall, his groin still aching as he watched the last of the moat gook slither down the drain pipe. Coating his body in a gentle, sleepy embrace, the shower's warm spray made him more than a little drowsy. Considering everything, it was a strange feeling. Getting shot at usually kept him wired for an evening. Lately, however, the slugs had been flying so thick and fast that they were no longer a novelty. Adrenalin was becoming a tiresome companion. Even Sule's knee in his crotch seemed in retrospect like nothing grander than a momentary distraction, though, at the time, he was quite certain that the universe was coming to an end. He curled his lips inward at the memory, letting the warm water invade his mouth and nostrils until he had to spew it out just to breathe. It was a good memory, he decided. It helped him forget about sleep.\nThe black fleximesh laid out for him was vastly superior to the mendwear he usually threw on. It was designed along some Draconian, poly-adaptive, one-size-fits-all concept. All-within-reason is what they actually meant. Mike aired off and slipped into the new threads, still damp from their soaking. Once they dried, the fibers would expand and harden. Decent protection, Mike figured, and it was air-tight to boot, better than a flak vest or a vacc suit and at a fraction of the bulk. Mike checked the fit in the mirror, the imperious grin sliding off his face as the glint of polished iridium met his gaze. A draconian, military insignia lay etched into the left breast: external intelligence if his guess wasn't too far off.\nKorina and Johanes were still in the study, each perched over the medical console like a pair of determined vultures as they argued over the finer features of a sub-dermal charge. Mike tried to meet Johanes' smile with one of his own, but even in his fleximesh uniform, the Draconian could put on a dastardly grin, unbeatable considering the image of the Realm most people carried around.\n\"Vlep's cooperating,\" Johanes patted the reception unit. \"They're going to Xekhasmeno... to the starport it seems. Oh, by the way... nice outfit.\"\n\"Same to you. You mind telling me why we're wearing these?\"\nJohanes put on a play frown, \"You don't like 'em?\"\n\"Walking into an Imperial starport with this on isn't exactly the quintessence of sanity.\"\n\"Well, it isn't exactly an Imperial starport anymore.\"\nKorina sighed, \"The Calannan government has assumed temporary control.\"\n\"Because of the riots?\"\nShe nodded, \"And all Imperial vessels have been banished from the planetary airspace.\"\nMike finally managed his smile, no longer wondering why Johanes seemed so pleased with himself. With a Royal Fleet passenger liner in orbit, it was a hefty blow to Imperial pride. Johanes had every right to be pleased, however, he dropped his smile when he noticed it becoming contagious.\n\"It's politics, Mike. The Imps are going along with it to help quell the riots.\"\n\"So Sule's gonna have a hard time finding herself a ride.\"\n\"A very hard time.\"\n\"That still doesn't answer my question.\"\nJohanes took a deep breath, cautiously scrutinizing the vacant space several inches in front of his nose.\n\"It's like this, Mike. The locals hate the Imps.\"\n\"They hate neghrali.\"\n\"But they hate the Imps in particular.\"\n\"Jo, the starport guards are not going to give you free run of the facilities just because you're a Draconian.\"\n\"If they have orders...\"\n\"Who have you been talking to?\"\nJohanes resumed his smile, \"A friend of yours.\"\n\"A friend?\"\n\"A powerful friend.\"\nMike winced, \"No.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I don't want to hear this.\"\n\"General Gardansa. He's now in charge of the starport. And the beauty of it, which is still making me crazy, is that this whole plan depends on you.\"\nMike sat down on the edge of the table, the med console casting a faint blue glimmer against the side of his face.\n\"What have you told him?\"\n\"Enough. Enough for him to understand how important it is that we find Sule before she gets offworld.\"\n\"Then what's the problem?\"\n\"He wants to hear it from you. He trusts you.\"\nMike coughed, \"That's absurd.\"\n\"I agree completely, but then again, he doesn't know you like I do.\"\n\"Yes he does.\"\nJohanes shrugged, \"Then I pity him.\"\nMike considered a jab to Jo's stomach but stuffed the notion back where it belonged. The fleximesh would make a stump of his hand before he'd ever inflect so much as mild irritation.\n\"You still haven't answered my question.\"\n\"Appearances are important, Michael. He doesn't want the world to know he's taking cues from a gatherer, particularly one to whom he owes favors.\"\n\"I'm sure he doesn't feel that he owes me anything. Besides, people will recognize me.\" Mike fingered his jacks to demonstrate the point. Johanes just cracked a grin.\n\"I'll find you a helmet. Look, Mike. He's not the nicest person on this planet, but he's all we've got, and we desperately need his help.\"\n\"Jo, whatever he does, he does for himself, not for you or me. If we go there, it's going to be us who are helping him accomplish his agenda. You understand?\"\nJohanes nodded, \"Yes. And I can live with it as long as it means stopping Sule. Why do you have a problem with it?\"\n\"If you knew him like I do, you wouldn't have to ask.\"\n\"Maybe I do, Michael. Spokes told me a few things, while you were busy having your jitters.\"\n\"Like what?\"\n\"He told me that Gardansa had you take a bath... with his limo. It took a little research to find out why. Gardansa's been effectively grounded this past year, his black market stolen by strong arms in the military.\"\nMike nodded, \"I know the details. He was too greedy. And I also know that he's trying to buy his way back in, except he isn't going through his people, Jo. He's going through ISIS. Did Spokes mention that?\"\n\"He told me.\"\n\"Then why are you doing this? For all we know, Sule could be sitting on Gardansa's lap, playing patty-cake with him right now.\"\n\"I doubt it.\"\n\"Why's that?\"\n\"It's what you said, Mike. He's greedy. He can get what he wants by turning us in to ISIS, but he can get much more by capturing Sule and holding her for the highest bidder. Think about it, and think about what the Imps will pay.\"\n\"They'll kill him.\"\n\"He's run that risk before. He'll run it again. And he may even make himself the planetary governor in the process.\"\n\"And you're going to let him?\"\n\"Appearances, Mike. They're more important than the reality. Gardansa can hand her over to us and then lie like a moon rock. He'll get paid by both sides, and when the Imps do get her back, there won't be any more in her head than is in Kato's. A justice fitting the crime.\"\nMike blinked, disgusted and impressed all at the same time.\n\"I can tell you've put some thought to this.\"\n\"You disapprove?\"\nMike gritted his teeth, \"No.\"\n\"I didn't think so.\"\n\"You figured all this while I was taking a shower?\"\nJohanes blushed, \"What can I say?\"\n\"Tell me about Vlep.\" Mike motioned toward the medical console, and Korina swiveled the screen toward him.\n\"Your scan shows a rather complex piece of equipment in his neck.\"\nMike exchanged glances with Johanes as she continued, pointing toward various points on the monitor display.\n\"The receiver is here. This seems to be the timing mechanism. This is a transmitter, presumably for location purposes, and here's the charge.\"\n\"Large package.\"\n\"Minute, actually. But it packs a wallop. Sule must have a transmitter somewhere on her which we assume will activate the charge.\"\nMike nodded, \"She was holding some sort of metallic cylinder as she passed me.\"\n\"Anything about it distinctive?\" Johanes interjected.\n\"No. Well, it had a gold tip.\"\nKori hit a key on the monitor, switching it off.\n\"To help Vlep, you're going to have to block the signal.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"The starport med-bay has durilium sheaths. Without knowing what frequency it's keyed to, it's the best we can do. I've already made the necessary arrangements.\"\n\"Thanks. How's your mom?\"\n\"They're freezing her downstairs. The radiation dose she took was killing her rather quickly.\"\nJohanes cringed, and Mike tried hard not to smirk.\n\"I didn't know your mother very well, Ms. Arien, and I'm no fan of the Draconian government, but I do hope they find a way to make her better. I hope everything works out for both of you.\"\nGreen eyes stared blankly back at him, either unimpressed or vaguely angry.\n\"You sound like you're making a farewell speech.\"\nMike looked toward the ground, almost certain that he didn't mean a word of it, and very certain that she knew.\n\"I guess I am.\"\nShe snorted on that one.\n\"Y'know. If there's one thing about you neghrali, it's that you're as presumptuous as hell. This may be news to you both, but I'm going with you. And before you say anything stupid, just remember, I've got more reason to want Sule than both of you put together.\"\nThe ride to Xekhasmeno aboard the Arien's grav limo proved both safe and expedient. During the trip, Mike kept a watch out the window as the amber glow of the city's electric barricade grew slowly in the distance. The city itself, however, lay covered in a murky shroud, as though the cold, ominous wind sweeping beneath the clouds had shattered every light and killed every flame. From the corner of his eye, he could see Kori watching him, her green eyes glinting faintly in the silver moonlight.\n\"Pretty incredible, eh Harrison?\"\n\"The locals must of knocked out the main reactor or something. The outer fence is on a separate capacitor.\"\n\"You didn't think us locals had it in us,\ndid you?\"\n\"You know, Korina, you're not really a local any more than your father.\"\n\"I was born here.\"\nMike nodded and shrugged, \"Well, congratulations.\"\n\"Here Harrison. Watch this.\"\nShe steered the limo into a dive so that Mike no longer had to tilt his head to see the ground. The earth below was nearly invisible against the night, a black tapestry marred only by a single long row of glowing specks. Every now and then, one of the specks would flare up and then die down slowly. As they continued to descend, the reason for the congestion became apparent.\nThere were rioters, perhaps a thousand or more: adults and children and many somewhere in between, each hateful enough to make the incident at the Arien estate seem more like a tea party. Instead of tossing their molotov's on a green stretch of lawn, they were throwing them into vehicles. One congregation worked on forming a blockade with burnt-out automobiles while others took pot shots at people as they ran from their cars. The smarter motorists took their vehicles off-road and out of the death zone. The limo leveled off at around a hundred meters altitude, and Mike felt more thankful for gravitics than he could ever remember.\nThere was less bloodshed at city's gates. Starport authority personnel had apparently been called out to supplement the city guard. Together, they held the line at the customs checkpoints, trying desperately to sift the deluge of legitimate inbounders from those who would get into the city just to wreck havoc.\nThe limo touched down outside the starport as a team of Imperial inspectors cruised around checking city passports and ID's. Mike was resigned to hiding beneath the floor in a tight space the Arien's had reserved for special occasions. He felt the gravitic propulsion kick in with a sudden jerk, knocking his head against the compartment's wall, and by the time he crawled back out, Kori was steering them into an anchoring shed over the starport's upper concourse.\nThe entire concourse deck was flooded with people, mostly offworlders seeking shelter from the rowdy locals, while groups of Calannic guards stood at the escalator entrances double- checking ID's and frisking the prettier ladies. The power on the escalators was down, and people were using them as stairs, most pausing as they stepped on, as though expecting the metallic steps to lurch from underneath and send them hurtling to the bottom.\n\"See something interesting?\" It was Korina. Mike tried to conjure a wholesome response, finally shaking his head and frowning.\n\"Here. This might help.\"\nShe placed the helmet over his head, helping him lock it in place. Mike squinted as the light-intensification automatically switched on. He could suddenly see clear beyond the landing ledge and all the way to the city gates. The moon glared like a strobe light on full beam, its glassy surface seemingly enlarged by the white clouds fusing beneath to form a bright, billowy halo.\n\"Better?\"\n\"I guess. Any word from Vlep?\"\n\"He's been quiet ever since we left the mansion. I can barely make out his breathing, but that's all. I'll give you a buzz on the helmet when I find out more. Okay?\"\nShe patted him firmly on the head as she exited the vehicle and began climbing down to the crowded deck, Johanes's reception unit swinging back and forth on her belt.\n\"Until we meet again, gatherer.\"\n\"Where's she going?\"\nThe Draconian casually removed his white overcoat.\n\"Somebody has to get Vlep's sheath and keep track of the bugger, right? We'll meet her at the med bay when we're done finalizing our arrangement with Gardansa.\"\nMike chewed his upper lip as Jo started patching in a line to the tower.\n\"I'll talk with Gardansa alone, Jo. You'd better go with her.\"\n\"You don't trust her?\"\n\"She's got revenge on her mind. She might try to go it alone.\"\nJohanes paused for a brief moment, finally putting his overcoat back on and heaving himself out the door. Mike waited a minute before placing the call.\n\"Tower, this is the DSS. Get me General Gardansa.\"\nPerkins sat at the edge of the airlock, fists sunken deep into his pockets as the cold night air washed over his face and into the hold. Beyond the landing platform, he could hear shouting and the loose carnage of Imperial gunfire. Long ago, it could have made him cringe, but he'd learned to expect such things from Calanna. The mood of her people was as unpredictable as her weather, balmy as a swamp on one evening and as cold as death the next.\nHe stood upright as the flat-top approached, Dilly behind the controls, and two locals with badges wandering among the crates, poking around here and there with Imperial mass detectors. Just trying to look busy for each other, Wendell guessed, though he had to wince and scrape a strange, leathery tongue off the roof of his mouth. Dealing with newbies was almost always a problem. He reminded himself to be polite, and stepped forward, nodding and smiling.\n\"Hi there.\"\n\"You Captain Perkins?\"\n\"Call me Wendell.\"\nDeep brown eyes consulted a flimsi-leaf.\n\"You fill claims form?\"\n\"My broker handles it.\"\n\"Ah... where is?\"\n\"You should have it on page three-dee.\"\nThe inspector tapped the corner of the flimsi with his light pen, obviously struggling to find the correct cell. Wendell smiled, trying to look alert and nonchalant all at the same time.\n\"You boys are new at this, aren't you? Look, do you mind if we load up here? We're sort of on a schedule and all, and I don't want ol' Louise blown out of the sky 'cause we missed our launch window. Okay?\"\nHe tagged it with a laugh. The two locals either didn't understand or weren't paying attention.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"Load cargo? Put boxes inside?\"\nThe one in charge nodded apologetically and waved his hand, as non-committal a gesture as Wendell had ever witnessed. Dilly seemed as confused as his boss until Wendell finally snorted and spat on the white cement, narrowly missing the inspector's boots.\n\"Go ahead Dil. If they start bitching,\nwe'll just have to stop.\"\n\"Is okay.\" The inspector nodded again and then got a curious look in his eyes, \"We go in ship.\"\n\"Well, that's perfectly understandable,\" he forced a grin. \"You are inspecting us, after all.\"\nMike yanked off his helmet, the resulting pressure release making his ears pop as he stood squarely before the plush mahogany desk. Grinning with a faint air of supremacy, the general tilted backward as far as the gravitic recliner would allow. Like his newfound power, it was just another toy, ripe for his sportive abuse. Mike wondered how long Gardansa would last this time as the general lifted his gaze, the fleshy folds of his chin jiggling as he gurgled with delight.\n\"Draconian Harrison, much time without sight as you offworlders say, eh? How long has it been? Three whole days?\"\n\"Something on that order,\" Mike smiled and found himself a seat, placing the helmet on a corner of the desk. \"You're surprised to see me, aren't you?\"\n\"Like this,\" Gardansa tilted upright, \"who wouldn't be.\"\n\"Forget the costume. It isn't important. Forget even why I'm here, and why you're behind that desk instead of hiding away like some snake.\"\nGardansa's eyes widened for a moment, as though he were contemplating calling his guards. Then he leaned back again, letting the gravitic waves catch his fall.\n\"An angry gatherer, eh? I am really the one who should be angry, you know. Did you see what they did to my car? To my driver?\"\nHe continued with a feeble shrug, \"Even though you are angry, and have every right to be maddened by rage, you must believe that I had no idea that ISIS wanted you dead. I guessed only that they wanted to talk to you and that they would catch you sooner or later despite your best efforts. You remember how I tried to convince you to leave the planet? But no, you would have none of my advice. So what was I to do? Let you slip between my fingers? Let you walk into their arms without even the gentlest of nudges?\"\n\"Why not?\"\nGardansa smirked, then sat upright as if to make an important point.\n\"Because like your friend, Mister Dulin, I was rotting. Deprived of all freedoms, I was less than dead. You asked me to free him, and yet you expected me to do nothing on my own behalf?\"\n\"I trusted you.\"\n\"Then you made a mistake. And so did I. Here, let us drink to the hope that we will both make many more before the fates claim us, eh?\"\nGardansa opened a desk drawer and pulled out two glasses of white brandy, already poured and ready for drinking. That was the sort of alcoholic he was. He didn't merely get drunk. He planned for it well in advance. Mike accepted the glass, placing it on the edge of the table without taking so much as a sip. The general watched him with a curious stare.\n\"Go ahead. It is not poison.\"\n\"I don't believe in fate,\" Mike explained.\n\"Then believe in luck. Worship her, my friend, for she worships you like no man I've ever known.\" And with that, the general's eyes widened again as he downed his glass in one, fitful gulp. Mike smiled, sipping his own.\n\"You also, General. And remember, it is not often, on Calanna, one is granted a reprieve. I assume you've been briefed by my associate?\"\n\"Johanes. His name was Johanes, yes?\"\n\"If that's what he told you.\"\n\"He told me you are looking for a bio-synthe and a psyche. My people are watching for them, although I make no promises. Smuggling has been elevated to a form of art on Calanna, and my resources are already stretched to their limit. It is more than conceivable that they could slip through.\"\nMike shook his head, \"It's not the finding part that I'm worried about.\"\nDilly breathed a sigh of relief as the inspectors steered the flat-top back down the loading ramp. What they lacked in efficiency they had more than accounted for in thoroughness. Back in the hold, Wendell was opening up his special box, the one that would double their profits and pay for some much needed repairs. He helped his Captain get the top off and fetched a pair of blankets out of the locker.\nBy the time he returned, a tall blonde woman had slipped out from beneath the numerous sacks of half-frozen quagga livers. She pulled out her companion with a determined yank, and he fell to the floor, clutching his sides and shaking from the cold. Dilly had to chuckle to himself as he held his nose before the wretched and exceedingly smelly pair.\nWendell handed over the blankets, trying hard to sound official, \"Welcome aboard the very independent freighter, Louise. This here is my first mate, who's going to check you folks out whether you like it or not, so I suggest you just stay put and be friendly.\"\nDilly slowly inched the metal scanner up and down the woman's sides.\n*Beep*\nHe didn't feel her swipe his feet off the floor until he was laying on his spine, clutching the back of his head and making angry faces. Her silver eyes flickered with something between hatred and amusement, and he felt his legs inch him back along the steel plate floor almost of their volition. The Captain, automatic pistol in hand, looked only moderately impressed.\n\"Not a wise move, lady.\"\n\"Frisking was not part of our contract.\"\n\"It is now. Show us what you've got, or there will be no contract.\"\nSeveral strands of snowy white hair fell across her face as she tilted toward her silent companion. For his benefit, or so she made it seem, she extracted the object of interest, a small metallic cylinder, its golden head shimmering in the dim actinic light of the hold. Wendell studied it from afar, motioning his first mate to once again preform his duties.\n\"You hand it to Dilly now.\"\n\"And if I don't?\"\n\"Look lady, I'll transport you and take the risk of getting caught, but I'll not strain my luck with my own quiet cargo.\"\n\"You are straining your luck, Captain. And my patience. This is a personal item. It does not concern you.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"A transmitter.\"\nWendell squinted his eyes, finally waving his mate to continue the scan.\n\"Except for that one thing, she's clean.\"\n\"Fine. Now try this one.\"\nHer companion tried to crawl away as Dilly approached.\n\"Don't worry. It doesn't hurt.\"\n\"No...\"\n*Beep*\nGardansa arched his eyebrows, an incredulous smirk traversing the width of his face.\n\"Friends of yours?\"\n*Beep*\nMike grimaced, \"One can never tell.\"\nGardansa watched, the petulant folds of his fleshy chin jiggling at the slight as his neghrali friend placed the helmet over his head.\n\"What's up? ...okay... consider it done.\" Mike whisked off the helmet, \"Sule's on the Merchant Vessel 'Louise'. She knows she's been spotted.\"\nGardansa nodded, pushing a button on his desk. \"This is Gardansa; get me Colonel Fen immediately.\"\n\"...Fen here, General.\"\n\"Where is the vessel 'Louise', Colonel?\"\n\"...Parked on platform eight.\"\n\"Seal off platform eight. Nobody comes off it.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\nHe pushed the button twice more, this time seeming in no particular hurry.\n\"Get me Kano Magor.\"\nHe turned to Mike, \"Platform eight is a parking lot, Michael. She isn't going to have time to escape us on foot, and if she takes to the air, we will shoot her down.\"\n\"...Magor reporting, General. What seems to be the problem?\"\n\"You have been restless and eager, Commander. Now it it time to prove your competence. I need an air strike on the 'Louise', a vessel on platform eight.\"\n\"Ah... an air strike, General??\"\n\"I also need you to float whatever you have in the air over that platform to make sure that nobody gets off it alive. Am I clear?\"\n\"Very.\"\n\"That will be all. Oh... and do not worry about peripheral damage. It is expected.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\nGardansa pushed his button again, a smug laugh escaping his lips. Mike could easily see why he liked having power. It meant he could overkill with complete impunity.\n\"This channel is restricted. If you wish to reach Commodore Reece, I suggest you leave a message with the Imperial embassy on-planet.\"\nThe voice on the other end coughed.\n\"Look, whoever the hell you are, I don't have time for this shit!\"\n\"I'm sorry but...\"\nTabor swore and pulled the reception cap off his head, drawing more attention that he cared for, particularly with Captain Dunham less than ten paces from his station. Dunham regarded him with that peculiar, ebony-eyed stare that he hated so much.\n\"Problem, Ensign?\"\nTabor shook his head, then nodded, then opened his mouth to explain.\n\"Captain,\" Lish looked up from her station, \"I've been monitoring the starport as you requested.\"\n\"One moment, Lieutenant.\"\n\"Sir, there's been a disturbance.\"\n\"Rioters?\"\n\"Unknown, sir. My readings show surface explosions.\"\n\"Explosions?\"\n\"Yes sir.\"\nThe dark creases along his forehead wrinkled in consternation.\n\"Give me that, Tabor. Hello?\"\nThe channel yielded only static, then a cough, then a voice, as ragged and course as a sander on flesh.\n\"Who... hell are you?\"\n\"I am Captain Dunham of the Crimson Queen. And who the hell, may I ask, are you?\"\n\"ISIS... operative.\"\n\"ISIS?... Hello?!\"\n\"Tell Commodore... hurt. Hurt bad. Get off this planet alive... mission success. Need air support.\"\n\"Wait. Mission... what mission?\"\n\"Tell her. ISIS out.\"\nJim Vassilakos (jimv@ucrengr.ucr.edu) works part-time as a programmer at a place so cheesy that he declined to mention the name.

Look at it. Does it look like it went through an explosion?' Chapter 14 `No.' `Which means that it's probably a little Jim Vassilakos going-away present. For us to go away. Permanently.'\"\nMIKE WATCHED FROM THE PLATFORM DECK AS EMERGENCY CREWS ADVANCED IN TEAMS, quenching the burning blaze. Magor had done a thorough job with his air strike, taking out not just one ship but two. That left fifteen unscathed; he'd probably get a medal for precision.\nFrom the Louise they'd pulled out fragments of at least three bodies. Fortunately, the other craft had been empty with not so much as a goldfish on board, at least according to starport records. Despite its crew's luck, however, Mike was sure they'd have a few choice words for the General. He'd be a caldron of hot water, and so far, he had nothing to show for it.\nJohanes was still busy chewing the bull with a pair of inspectors while Korina sat quietly beside a burnt piece of fuselage, her long, dark hair obscuring the left side of her face as her cheek and forehead glistened crimson against the fiery blaze. Mike walked over, doffing his helmet, his knees still wobbly from the senseless destruction. She stared directly at them, but didn't otherwise acknowledge his presence. Above, the stars seemed to fade as the billowing clouds of smoke settled amongst the black of night.\n\"You're trying to sense for Sule, aren't you?\"\nShe blinked and looked up. Mike sat down beside her, the cold, damp air layering a blanket of chill along his jacks.\n\"And you're not finding anything.\"\nKori looked down at the cement pavement.\n\"For a moment....\" she struggled to find the words, her eyes narrowing into thin slits. \"I thought I'd felt her laughter.\" She smiled, probably at how stupid it sounded. \"I guess I just feel cheated. I wanted to kill her myself.\"\nShe stared back at him through the flickering, smoky light, uncertainty clouding her green eyes, and Mike gave her his thought, if only for the humor's sake. She smiled, then tittered at the edge of the joke, and then frowned again.\n\"Yes, Mr. Harrison. She was capable of laughter. But it wasn't the kind of laughter you or I know. I'd first felt it when she kicked Erestyl's burnt corpse into my father's moat. It was the sort of victory laugh that has nothing to do with anything anyone normal would call funny.\"\n\"Are you sure you felt it... here?\"\nShe stared into the flames, but wouldn't answer. She didn't need to. Mike stood up, sliding his helmet back on.\n\"Keep trying.\"\nJohanes, having finished with the inspectors, was busying himself by nosing around the ship's shattered cargo hold. He picked up a piece of smoking meat, smelling it and finally taking a bite.\n\"Devouring the evidence?\"\n\"Quagga liver. This stuff is great. You ever try it?\"\nMike shrugged, \"My dad used to love it. What did you find out?\"\n\"There were supposedly two crew members on board when it happened. That makes four corpses, one unaccounted for. You thinking what I'm thinking?\"\n\"This place is a mess, Jo. Three may not even be the correct body count.\"\n\"Don't kid yourself. I'm a professional, alright? Three is correct.\" He handed Mike an automatic pistol.\n\"Where'd you get this?\"\n\"It was on the floor. Check out the clip.\"\nMike opened it up.\n\"Fourteen of fifteen isn't bad.\"\n\"Only the difference between life and death, or being healthy versus feeling like slog shit.\" He smiled.\n\"Why would she leave it behind.\"\n\"Exactly. I don't think it's her's at all. But somebody did fire it for one reason or another. This here may be the reason.\" Johanes pointed toward a small, metallic, gold-tipped cylinder, still gleaming in the light of the flames. \"Look familiar?\"\nMike leaned over to grab it.\n\"Don't, Michael. Look at it. Does it look like it went through an explosion?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Which means that it's probably a little going-away present. For us to go away. Permanently. You understand? I had the worst time steering the fire crew clear of it when they came in here, so I'll be damned if you set it off.\"\n\"You sure you're not just being paranoid?\"\nJohanes smiled, \"Just because you're paranoid, Michael, doesn't mean they aren't really out to get you.\"\nJohanes kept poking around, chewing quagga liver, hoping to find some shred of evidence to prove himself wrong. Not too far away, Gardansa was talking on a portable phone.\n\"You say to them that their petition is under consideration, however, if they violate our airspace, they will face the consequences of their trespasses. That is all.\"\nHe hung-up, wiping his forehead with the back of his sleeve, and Mike put a hand on his shoulder.\n\"What's going on, General?\"\n\"Trouble.\"\n\"Of what nature?\"\n\"Of an Imperial nature. Commodore Reece sends her malevolent tidings, a delegation of inspectors to assess the damage.\"\n\"So what's the problem?\"\n\"They will be accompanied by the Crimson Queen's escorts to ensure interstellar peace and the sanctity of Imperial property.\"\nHe added a flowery emphasis to the last part. If Xekhasmeno was Imperial property, then the starport was even more so. The planetary government's treaty with the Empire made that point abundantly clear. It was the very reason the city was under siege, and it was also the reason the Imps would float a dozen armored gunships over the starport, regardless of airspace.\n\"How long do we have?\"\n\"A centim. Two perhaps.\" Gardansa shrugged, \"I hope we have finished our work here.\"\n\"You're going to back down?\"\n\"I have no choice. They know, and I know it. The situation is, in short, frightfully plain.\"\n\"Then we've achieved nothing.\"\n\"Can you prove that?\"\n\"No, but I'm working on it.\"\n\"Do it, and I will destroy every vessel on this platform just to be done with her.\"\nMike blinked, \"I take it you've met Sule?\"\n\"She visited me before you arrived three days ago. Told me that ISIS would be watching, and that if I didn't cooperate, she would emasculate me and have my testes for breakfast.\"\n\"So it was love at first sight.\"\n\"Hardly.\"\n\"Admiration perhaps?\"\nHe sighed, \"Admiration and love are two distinct creatures, sometimes confused, occasionally compatible, but otherwise the one has absolutely nothing to do with the other. No my friend. It was something more akin to dread and dishonor mixed together with a touch of avarice, the sort of complementary qualities a man can sink his teeth into.\"\n\"She made you an offer.\"\n\"She made me betray you, or at least I chose to.\"\nMike smiled, though Gardansa could not see it through the helmet's face plate.\n\"You'd better get inside, lest Sule make good her promise.\"\n\"She is dead.\"\n\"She wants air cover so she can get out of here.\"\n\"You are hallucinating, my friend.\"\n\"Just do me a favor.\"\nGardansa laughed, turning around, \"What is it now? Shall we scorch the entire platform on a gatherer's hunch?\"\n\"That's not a bad idea.\"\n\"And start a war in the process, not to mention putting my neck on the chopping block? No, I think not.\"\n\"Just do a ship by ship search and try to hold off the Imps as long as you can. That's all I'm asking.\"\n\"There are fifteen vessels here. What you propose will eat more time than we are served.\"\n\"What do we have to lose by trying?\"\nGardansa shifted away, making a guttural sound somewhere between annoyance and acceptance. Mike had to smile. He knew he would get his way. It was easier for the General to give in than to sift among hypothetical arguments, and Gardansa was basically a lazy person.\nMike started to pace the vessel's circumference, watching the work crews extinguish the last of the flames. One of Gardansa's officers stood among them, pulling groups of two off the work at hand and pointing them toward the other vessels. Several meters away, Korina stood upright in the smoke veiled darkness. With the light intensification, she looked almost ethereal, walking toward Mike through the patchy, grey mist.\n\"So what's the verdict?\"\nMike sighed, \"Well . . . you still feel cheated?\"\n\"Sule's alive then.\"\n\"Probably. Can you track at all?\"\nKori shook her head, \"I'm a telepath. I get in people's heads.\"\n\"Can you read impressions from non-animates?\"\nShe nodded, \"Most psyches can somewhat.\"\n\"A friend of mine once honed her ability to the extreme by wandering around my house, picking up my things, and scolding me for whatever was going through my mind when I last handled them.\"\n\"I'm not that good.\"\n\"Considering who your parents are, one would tend to think otherwise.\"\n\"I'm not that practiced.\"\n\"We'll see. C'mon.\"\nJohanes was still poking around the deck, a piece of quagga liver in one hand and a short, metal rod in the other. Kori regarded him with a mixture of apprehension and curiosity.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Trying to find the bullet.\"\n\"What's he talking about?\"\nMike showed her the clip.\n\"Jo, I'd like Korina to take a look at Sule's going-away present.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"To glean some impressions off it.\"\n\"That means touching, doesn't it?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"She moves it a centimeter and we could all be organ donors.\"\n\"You can stand back if you want.\"\nJohanes sighed and stepped back about a dozen meters.\n\"Why take chances?\" he grinned, lengthening the distance a little further.\nKorina didn't look amused.\n\"I take it this is going to be dangerous?\"\nMike shrugged, \"Crossing the street is dangerous. Breathing smog is dangerous. This... this is a cakewalk.\"\nShe rested her pinky against it, closing her eyes for a long moment during which Mike remained frozen still, all except for his knees. They jiggled back and forth, barely supporting his weight.\nKori looked up, \"She feels very dumb.\"\n\"So do I,\" Mike added. \"Why don't you take your hand away from it now?\"\n\"One moment.\"\nKori didn't close her eyes this time. Instead, she just let them become enveloped by that glassy sort of gaze Mike was growing used to.\n\"Pain.\"\nKori withdrew her hand, and Mike let the breath out of his lungs in one, steady withdrawal.\n\"That's it?\"\n\"Her pain was the strongest thing there. Once I found it, there was no point in continuing. It will mask or distort everything beneath it.\"\n\"What kind of pain?\"\nShe reached out, and almost without thinking, Mike placed the automatic into her hands. Johanes was back, a smug look on his face.\n\"Where's the boom?\"\n\"Your hypothesis about the gun is amassing evidence.\"\n\"Of what sort?\"\nThey both looked toward Kori. She handed it back, uncertain.\n\"It's too polluted. Like I said, I am not as good as your friend, Mr. Harrison.\"\n\"Well, we shouldn't have handled it. Jo, quiz time. Where do you go on a ship when you're hurt?\"\n\"Medical Bay.\"\n\"There is none.\"\n\"Ship's locker.\"\n\"Where would that be?\"\n\"In front of the airlock, most likely.\"\nConsidering a missile had slammed into the ship, the locker was remarkably intact.\n\"What a mess.\"\n\"Well, at least we won't need a key to open it.\"\nThey began shoveling through its contents, most of them burnt or foam covered,\nscattered in front of the open iris valve. There were vacc suits, communicators, canned rations, and even a few weapons, all standard fare for an independent freighter. There were even medical supplies.\n\"Oh my... look what we have here.\"\nMike looked over Johanes' shoulder. The gauze towel was stained a deep red where it wasn't carbonized.\n\"Looks like somebody didn't want to bleed all over the pavement. Kori?\"\n\"Can I move this one?\"\n\"Be my guest.\"\nShe took it in both hand, closing her eyes.\n\"Lots of pain.\"\n\"Get past it.\"\nA look of concentration fell across her features.\n\"There's too much.\"\n\"You're trying too hard. I've seen Kitara... that's the friend I was telling you about... at first she used to do what your doing, and it never worked. Just relax and let it come.\"\nKori, though drained and disheartened, looked somewhat amused. \"I am the psyche here, Mr. Harrison.\"\n\"Just try what I'm saying, okay?\"\nShe closed her eyes again, this time wandering amidst the pain without fighting it. Somewhere in the corner of her mind, she felt the worry and strain of failure engulfing her. It was like a wave, drowning away all hope.\n\"I can't...\"\n\"Yes you can.\"\n\"...need help... Reece.\" She re-opened her eyes, seeming weary and withdrawn. Confusion cluttered her green eyes.\n\"Who's Reece?\"\nJohanes answered as he continued sifting through the articles on the deck. \"She's the Imperial Commodore on the Crimson Queen. It arrived in-system two days ago. I'm sure you've both heard of it.\"\nMike nodded, \"She just sent a message to General Gardansa. They're bringing in a team of Imperial inspectors, along with the Crimson's defensive force.\"\n\"You didn't think to mention this to me before?\" Beneath the overcoat, he was still wearing a Draconian insignia. Mike realized that his own was even more blatant.\n\"Sule must have reached her. Could any of these communicators have talked to orbiting craft?\"\n\"Uh, this one.\"\nHe reached for one which was so large it came complete with a back harness. Mike held him back before he touched it, motioning Kori forward. She looked bushed.\n\"You're kidding, right?\"\n\"You want to find Sule or not? Just give it a shot.\"\nShe took a deep breath, grabbing the harness in both hands. Immediately she felt the pain, and underneath it the hopelessness and anger. But there was more, something she couldn't reach. Kori looked up, exhausted.\n\"I can't.\"\n\"We're putting you through a workout, aren't we?\"\n\"I was close to something. I'm just not trained for this.\"\n\"C'mon,\" Mike lifted her up by her shoulders. \"It's more likely that she would have made the transmission outside. She wouldn't want a bulkhead blocking the signal for one thing.\"\n\"And it's not in a burning freighter for another,\" Johanes added.\n\"The surface emotions are too strong anyway.\"\n\"We're just asking you to try, okay?\"\nShe sighed, holding it again as they stepped outside. She could feel them depending on her. And yet there was more, Sule's dependence on her people, her need to find someplace to hide. Kori considered each in turn. They were both obvious facts and thus constituted potential figments of imagination. If she could not get below her own prejudices, how could she hope to discriminate Sule's? Kori stared at the various vessels, trying to imagine them as Sule might have seen them, without the emergency workers knocking on doors, brandishing firearms. They would be better off with someone else, someone neutral and non- emersed. All she could concentrate on was her exhaustion. Her anger and desire for revenge could no longer contain it.\n\"C'mon, Korina. You're not even trying.\"\nShe stared upward toward Mike, but instead of seeing him, all she could see was a huge ball of fire where the ship had been, it's flames engulfing her, searing her skin as she rolled on the ground in agony. For a long moment, she couldn't breathe, and then she felt hands on her, pulling her gently toward the sky.\n\"Kori! Come out of it!\"\n\"Wha...\"\n\"Put her down, Mike.\"\nMike complied, though he wasn't sure why, and as though in a trance, she crawled back to the communicator, grabbing the receptor in a crouched position.\n\"Who the hell are you?!\"\nSeveral of the guards turned, distracted by her tone if not the content which only a few could understand.\"\n\"...get off planet... alive.\"\nShe then crawled back toward the ship, tossing the communicator back into the pile where they had found it and began searching her pockets in obvious anger. Johanes handed her a lightpen, which she threw into the ship's hold through the airlock. Around her, Kori saw nothing of the audience she had attracted. She knew only the fire, burning her hands and legs as she stumbled, half-crawling from the blaze.\n\"Kill you... Harrison.\"\nMike stepped back as she staggered toward the far end of the deck, clawing in vain at one of the vessel's airlocks and fumbling open the outer comm-unit, the ship's doorbell, in effect. Johanes stopped her from opening a channel, pulling her back and dropping her soundly on the cement. Mike picked her back up, dragging her several meters from the congregation that had now formed.\n\"Kori... come out of it.\"\n\"I'm sorry... I can't do it.\"\n\"You did do it.\"\nBut she couldn't hear him. Nor could she hear the crowd of soldiers lined up outside the ship, nor Gardansa telling Mike how he always picked the craziest women, nor even the Imperial gunships screaming overhead. Her world was a haze of smoke and fire and illusory burns, powdered wet by an icy veil of morning mist.\n\"No! Hold fire!\" Johanes held his hand up against the anticipated spray of bullets, as though his flesh and bone would constitute a serious deterrent.\n\"This is an airlock! We need something big! You!\"\nHe pointed toward the adjacent ship. One of the crew was peeking out the dorsal hatch to see what all the commotion was about.\n\"Who, me?\"\n\"Fire your aft laser turret at this door!\"\n\"What?! Are you crazy?!\"\n\"Do it!\"\n\"I'm not even a gunner!\"\n\"Harrison, take over!\"\nMike felt his heart drop down to his stomach as Johanes darted toward the adjacent ship. Immediately, all the solders spread out, and Mike felt the ground rumble as the vessel warmed up its engines.\n\"Jo, she's gonna bolt!\"\n\"Just grab something and hang on!\"\nThe vessel slowly lifted itself off the ground, a thin row of hand holds convenient for zero-gee repairs extending from the airlock down along its ventral surface. Mike leapt forward and grabbed one, feeling all vestiges of sanity slowly slip away as the vessel ascended further, hovering several meters off the platform with a considerable roar while leaving his body dangling beneath, like a bug about to be squashed.\nHe had to avert his eyes as the crisp beam of laser light cut a jagged hoop in the airlock's outer door. In its wake, it left a black ring of molten slag, and more out of desperation than design, he felt himself crawl toward it, pounding open the smoking circlet and sending it crumbling inward as a pile of gutted scrap metal. Below, the emergency personnel steadily shrunk to the size of toy soldiers, and Mike clawed his way inside, the deck shaking like a earthquake, sending him rolling against the inner door. Only its window had been fully serrated by the laser, and the opening mechanism refused to respond even to the coercion of an automatic pistol.\nMike reached through the window, recklessly clawing for any knob or button that would open it from the other side. He finally found the appropriate switch at the very end of his reach and nearly took his own arm off as the door slid open, the window's compartment disappearing into the bulkhead. Then the vessel lurched from some impact, throwing him forward and into the deck, and for several moments all he could hear was a deafening thunder. When he opened his eyes, the sky was as bright as day, and he found himself draped over the corpse of a woman, her bruised neck twisted almost completely around to the point where her spine had been severed. Mike rolled off her, the sky darkening as the airlock door closed behind him and several nozzles on the ceiling began emitting a grayish fog.\nThrough the helmet's face plate, he could see a patch of red Galanglic blinking in the upper-left corner of his field of vision. \"Contaminant detected. Switching to internal oxygen supply.\" The next several breaths felt strange, producing a tingling sensation in his hands and feet. He sat down and consciously slowed his respiration. Meanwhile, the fog began to thin out, flowing through the air lock's shattered window and into the cold, dark night. As the moon rotated from view, Mike could barely make out the walls or the floor, even with the light intensification the helmet provided.\nMike waited a minute, letting his eyes adjust. More medical supplies were scattered on the floor, and in the dim hallway he could barely make out the aperture to the ship's locker. It's latch was broken, and he slid the opening manually. Two vacc suits rested on the floor, their rack broken, and a pile of seal-it patches lay scattered about beneath. Mike grabbed a handful, bumping his helmet into something solid. He yanked out the offending piece of equipment to get a better look. It was a power pack, its thin black cord anchored somewhere within the gloomy confines of the locker.\nHe reached back inside, pulling out a laser carbine. It's metal barrel glinted dimly in the icy starlight, and Mike donned the power pack over his shoulder, switching the weapon to \"ready\" mode and pulling off its safety guard. He then crouched down, slowly inching his way down the corridor. It was crossed by another, and Mike peeked left, toward the prow. The new corridor terminated with an iris value, and Mike guess it led to the bridge, to Sule. The door would be locked, and he was holding its key.\nMike positioned himself on his knees directly in front of the door and leveled the carbine to begin sawing. The valve's metal frame seemed ever more sturdy than the airlock, its numerous, interlocking layers refusing to yield against the laser light which was emitted from the barrel in short pulses rather than a steady stream. Another minute or two passed, the carbine's power running low, and his only consolation as gravity began to disappear was that he didn't have to worry about a kinetic kick each time he fired.\nHe stopped, looking for some power socket in the wall when the valve twirled open, Sule standing in the open aperture with a fully automatic rifle. She began firing before the door was even open, and Mike ducked down as the first several bullets whizzed frictionless and silent above his head, the next several impacting with the top of his helmet, his face plate, and his upper chest. He toppled backward, the numerous collisions tumbling him down the corridor end over end while he watched his own blood seep into the vacuum in the form of little red bubbles, floating freely in the cold, breathless corridor.\nHe fought the rushing noise in his head, pulling the seal-it patches out of his pocket and tearing them one by one off their spines while placing them all over the fleximesh and the side of his helmet. The liquid adhesive hardened in moments, and in less than a minute, he could feel the pure oxygen rushing into his lungs, his hands tingling with excitement as the corridor seemed to swirl this way and that. He pushed off, with a grunt, floating himself back toward the bridge. Sule was no longer in the corridor, and the open iris valve beckoned him to enter.\nPeeking inside, he half-expected to see her at the controls, as if nothing had happened. Instead, he saw her writhing in the corner of the room, a virtual pool with hundreds of little red bubbles floating about the room. They continued to flow in a steady stream from her arm, and Mike could see her desperately trying to cover the burnt hole with her other hand. She didn't have any patches, and as she looked toward him, she seemed to scream, soundless waves of anger stealing the last of her breath until she finally succumbed to the frigid vacuum.\nMike continued to watch, floating without momentum, as a small red spec drifted in front of one eye. It was from inside the helmet, his own blood, and he knew he had no way of binding the wound. Slowly, the cold began to wash over him, and he shivered silently in his private abode. The ship was his, such as it was. For all he knew, it would stay that way forever.\nJim Vassilakos (jimv@ucrengr.ucr.edu) works part-time as a programmer at a place so cheesy that he declined to mention the name.

Jim Vassilakos `Pupil reflex positive. We've got a live one, people.'\"\nThe morning sun's delicate rays curved across Calanna's sloping horizon, blues and reds mixing together in a strange and beautiful tapestry of seas and continents spinning gently in the vastness of space. Erik watched from the open airlock, his eyes full of the gorgeous vista. It had been a long time since he'd seen a world from orbit with nothing between his nose and vacuum save for a thin layer of plastic. It had been a very long time, though it was even longer to fall. \"A little closer.\"\nBelow them, the target vessel waited in impassive silence, its starboard aft gaping and gnarled like a crippled beast immersed in deathly slumber. Slowly it grew, until they were practically upon it.\n\"Hold us here, bridge. Okay, Beckerson at my back. Gringer and Saloris, next.\"\nErik pushed himself into the void, the orange tether his only assurance of returning. Splintered open by laser fire, the vessel's port airlock seemed the best entrance. He slipped inside, reaching the inner portal. Its opening mechanism was obviously damaged, though laser scoring didn't seem to have anything to do with it.\n\"Beckerson. What do you make of this?\"\nThe enlisted man stuck his gloved hand in the broken electronics compartment, fishing around until he found what he was looking for. When it reemerged, he was holding a small, flattened piece of metal. Erik studied it apprehensively.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Kinetic projectile casing.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"A bullet, sir.\" The others smiled, obviously amused by the exchange.\n\"Don't give me attitude, Mister.\"\n\"No sir.\"\nErik reached through the door's smashed window, gently pawing the opposite side for a switch. When the door finally decided to move, he wasn't ready for it and ended up obstructing its egress into the wall with a padded arm.\n\"Damnit... stop it!\"\nSaloris fired his laser into the groove between the door and its compartment until the mechanical apparatus agreed to surrender its quarry. They successfully dislodged his arm moments later.\n\"Well, at least that got it open.\"\nBeckerson nodded, \"Good job, sir.\"\nThe others managed to keep straight faces this time, and Erik found it hard to forge a reply, particularly when he saw the corpse, her skin frozen and eyes sunken inward, the fluid beneath them still boiling away in the silent vacuum.\n\"My God.\"\nBeckerson turned against the bulkhead in agreement, for once without a wisecrack to share as Saloris stepped cautiously over the body, Gringer at his back.\n\"Hold, people.\" Erik squeezed past them, \"I'm sorry I didn't warn you. This wasn't entirely unexpected.\"\n\"What the hell are we looking for, sir?\"\n\"Survivors. Exactly as you were briefed. But I remain in front.\"\nSaloris let a wry smile escape his lips.\n\"Be my guest.\"\nErik shook his head, \"I wasn't asking your permission, Saloris. You're at my back. Everyone turn on your head lamps.\"\nThey reached the intersection in the corridor and turned left. The laser carbine scuttled silently along the floor as Erik gently nudged it, and the half-open iris valve showed heavy laser scars. Inside, two bodies rested in a corner, their vacc suits smothered beneath hundreds of flattened, red, bubbling spheres. Erik slowly inched forward, inadvertently kicking the globules of blood this way and that, as he bent over, shining his head lamp into a pair of brown eyes.\n\"Pupil reflex positive. We've got a live one, people.\"\nTouchdowns and takeoffs were always the best parts. Those few she experienced reminded her of life as a young girl, always getting a window seat so she could see the darting scenery. As a Commodore, her treatment was much the same. She was cloistered by her aides, pampered by her servants, and each world she visited seemed like no more than a montage of elegant architecture and postcard panoramas, not so much because of the worlds themselves as because of her remote and incredibly detached perspective. Somehow, after decades of tireless work, she had finally come full circle. That was the bitter taste of success: to have accomplished all of one's goals, yet to have ultimately changed nothing.\nThey treated her as a child, albeit a child to be obeyed. In a strange sort of way she rather liked it, but it was too rare that she could visit the fun spots on a planet, even those where the Empire was respected. Instead, her aides kept her cooped in orbit, tantalizing her with selected scenes from various travel videos so as to give her the illusion of adventure. She'd seen the Undercity, the Runyaelin, and even the Palace of Snagarth over and over again, though to have actually visited any of those places could have meant her life. Of that, she had little doubt.\nShe was so used to her sheltered existence, that if it wasn't for the cool, fresh breeze sifting her hair, she could have imagined herself in an entertainment booth back aboard the Crimson Queen, watching the local star's amber rays scatter carelessly across an illusory, purple horizon. A great risk it was to breathe fresh air beneath a wild, open sky, she thought to herself, as the guards formed a protective circlet around her.\n\"Lieutenant.\"\n\"Sir?\"\n\"Is it dawn or dusk?\"\n\"Dawn, sir.\"\n\"Good.\"\nIt meant that real sunlight, not artificial radiation, would touch her for the first time in weeks. She smiled in anticipation. First, however, she had business to attend to, and the sooner it was over, the better.\nThe starport administrator's office was about as plush as Imperial specifications would allow. General Gardansa sat behind the mahogany desk, standing and saluting at she entered. It was their first meeting in person, though she had grown rather used to him during their electronic meetings.\n\"Commodore, what a glorious occasion. Please be seated. I must warn you that your visit comes as somewhat of a surprise. What, with the civic unrest, we have not been able to take all the security precautions...\"\n\"Forget about my security, General. We both know why I'm here.\"\n\"Ah... yes. The starport. I assure you, no harm has come to it.\"\n\"I noticed you people are without power.\"\n\"We shut down the main generator as a precaution. With the nuclear incident, it was not inconceivable that the rioters would try to take an eye for an eye.\"\nReece nodded, \"I understand that you had some sort of incident this morning.\"\n\"Incident?\"\n\"...that you ordered an air strike on an unarmed merchant craft which was harbored at this facility.\"\nThe general laughed as he leaned back.\n\"Ah... of course. As I expected, your information is less than complete.\"\n\"Do tell.\"\n\"The craft you speak of was smuggling a suspected felon off-planet. It was in the process of departing when we discovered the crime in-process and acted accordingly.\"\nReece arched an eyebrow, mildly amused by the story.\n\"What sort of felon?\"\n\"I will make all our information available to you in due time.\"\n\"Did you manage to catch the person?\"\nGardansa frowned, \"Unfortunately, no. This was the reason I was so insistent that our airspace not be violated. By sending down your inspectors at such an inopportune moment and having your gunships fire on us as we attempted to pursue our suspect... ah... we we're unable to deal effectively with the situation at hand.\"\n\"I am told that your vessels harassed ours first.\"\n\"A misunderstanding, I am certain. However, now that we have cleared the smoke between us, I hope that you will return our suspect, especially in consideration of the fact that the vessel we intended to pursue is still in our airspace.\"\n\"It's in orbit.\"\n\"Technicalities, merely. May I interest you in a drink?\" He opened one of the desk's drawers, ushering forth two glasses. Commodore Reece was about to decline when a subtle knock came from the door.\n\"Commodore, you have an urgent call.\"\n\"If you'll excuse me, General. This will just be a moment.\"\n\"Take your time,\" he smiled, a glass in each hand. \"As you can see, I am in good company.\"\nShe stepped onto a balcony with her private aide, snatching the radio from his hand and shooing him back inside.\n\"Wait. Is this coded?\"\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\"Good. Leave me. This is Reece.\"\nThe static on the other end was fairly fierce.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Commodore, this is Lieutenant Torin.\"\n\"Go ahead Lieutenant. I read you.\"\nErik took a deep breath, the communications officer leaning beside him catching the hint and getting up to fetch a highbowl of zardocha.\n\"We've recovered one survivor from the target, sir. The doctors say he'll be fine but that he'll need time to recuperate before we can get any information.\"\n\"Have you confirmed that he's ISIS?\"\n\"Not yet, but considering the wavelength he chose to make initial contact, I'd say it's pretty much a sure thing.\"\n\"What about the craft? Did the local's damage it badly?\"\n\"Well, they shattered the fuel tanks. According to our engineer's, the drives are still in working order, but the thing just ran out of pep before it could really break free of the planet's gravity well.\"\n\"You mean it's coming back down?\"\n\"Yeah... well, they've been telling me that we should either tow it to a safer altitude to make repairs or rig up an independent fuel supply. If we want to keep the ship, that is.\"\n\"How long until it falls low enough to burn-up in the planet's atmosphere?\"\n\"Um... we've been getting jolted up here by scattered clouds of gas, but disintegration is probably a week away, at least.\"\nReece chewed her lower lip, weighing the options.\n\"This is the problem, Lieutenant. Our friend up there committed some crimes down here, and the local representative is already talking about extradition. They're not going to sit on their hands for even a day while their suspect is floating only a few kilometers over their heads.\"\n\"We can assume custody, can't we?\"\n\"Probably, but there would be a stink, and the locals are restless enough as it is.\"\n\"Then what do we do? I'm sure they've already scanned us making contact.\"\nReece shook her head, \"Two vessels in the same place, one an Imperial gunship and the other an independent merchant, and beyond that, they know nothing. So this is the story. Instead of allowing himself to be captured, their suspect turned his nose directly into the gravity well and hit full throttle.\"\n\"That's suicide.\"\n\"And from what I understand, far safer than Calannan justice. As far as we are concerned, this rescue never happened. How's it sound?\"\nErik blinked, \"You're asking my opinion?\"\n\"Lieutenant, right now you are the closest, healthy thing I have to an ISIS representative. Yes, I'm asking for your opinion.\"\n\"Well, although it's unlikely, I can't rule out that the initial transmission Captain Dunham received wasn't monitored, and if it was...\"\n\"I can live with a small risk. Anything else?\"\n\"Um... we've been practically coupling ship-to-ship up here. Considering the proximity, they're probably not going to believe us.\"\nReece smiled, \"I'm not asking if they'll buy it.\"\n\"Well, some will, and some won't. But they can't prove we're lying. That's what diplomacy boils down to, right?\"\n\"More or less. Anything else?\"\n\"Not offhand.\"\n\"Then you know what to do.\"\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\"Good. Do it. Reece out.\"\nThe communications officer returned with the zardocha, floating a highbowl in Erik's general direction as he fidgeted with the various knobs and dials. Erik took a sip and then downed the icy liquid in one shot. It was already well past his sleep shift, and he knew he'd need the jolt of wake-up and several more like it just to keep going.\n\"How do I get engineering?\"\n\"Here.\"\n\"Cooper, you down there?\"\n\"Right here, Erik.\" Her voice sounded crisp and almost perky, one of those workaholics who enjoyed any chance to get out and play with a new piece of machinery. They'd met at the officers' club some four months back during a surprise birthday bash for one of the fleet's retired admirals. Thereafter, he'd been found hanging around engineering a little more often than he'd like to admit. She caught on pretty quick but seemed more amused than interested, so he put away his notions before they ever got around to becoming more than notions.\n\"Erik, you there?\"\n\"Yeah. Sorry. I'm gonna have to take you up on that offer.\"\n\"Which one?\"\n\"About the collapsible deuterium compartment. Time is an issue.\"\n\"Oh, sure. Inside two hours. No problem.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"You want to forward Arch the specs on our new toy?\"\n\"No. We aren't taking her back to the Crimson.\"\nThere was a short pause on the other end.\n\"Then what are we doing?\"\n\"Your new toy's taking the big plunge. Hate to be the one to break the news.\" He smiled.\n\"Any special reason?\"\n\"I'd tell you if I could, but I can't, so I won't. Okay?\"\nAnother pause, and he could almost see the dejected look in her eyes.\n\"Oh well. Fireworks from orbit, I guess.\"\nAs far as fireworks went, they weren't particularly exciting. They even went out of their way to make sure nobody got hurt. Erik kept his eyes open and alert, however, right until the very end.\n\"Impact confirmed.\"\nTraveling at several hundred kilometers per hour, an impact with the Aeluin meant instant destruction of whatever hadn't disintegrated on the way down. The locals had kept clear once they realized what was going on, and from their radio transmissions, it didn't sound like they were going to investigate. At a depth of several kilometers, who would?\nErik entered his quarters, exhausted but very satisfied with a job well done. Almost done, he reminded himself, as he keyed in the strongbox's combination. Though blurry-eyed, he was careful. One slip of the finger would mean incineration of the records, not to mention his life. The vault opened, and he found the folder he was looking for, slapping the door shut with a stern swipe of his hand.\n\"Computer. Access medical records, John Doe.\"\n\"Done.\"\n\"Display picture, facial, forward.\"\nThe chiphead's picture emerged on the far wall. Erik leafed through the personnel folder. All it's information could easily be contained on one flimsi, but for security's sake, ISIS insisted on using a lower, more combustible technology. He knew what was really going on, of course. They just wanted to scare the hell out of him, and at that they usually did a good job.\nDing\nHe lifted his head, his mind so fuzzy that he wondered if he was imagining noises.\nDing\n\"Computer, open channel visitor.\"\n\"Hey Erik, you in there?\" It was Cooper. He was about to tell the computer to open the door when he bit his tongue before the words could drop out.\"\n\"Yeah, sort of. What's up, Lieutenant?\"\n\"I was hoping we could talk.\"\n\"Sort of late for a social visit, isn't it?\"\n\"The way you were guzzling zardocha, I figured you'd be wide awake.\"\n\"What's this about Lieutenant?\"\n\"Well... I was wondering why we destroyed that ship back there. I'm sort of confused as to who's making the decisions, and I was just hoping you could just clue me in a little.\"\nErik snorted, \"The decisions come straight from the top. It's better not to question them, okay?\"\n\"Yeah, I sort of figured you'd say that. You gonna let me in or what?\"\n\"I'm really tired.\"\n\"Don't brush me off, Erik.\"\nHe winced. He wanted to let her in, but he knew it'd be a bad idea. She didn't have a need to know, which meant telling her anything could spell his court-martial. Better to just piss her off all at once than bit by bit, he figured.\n\"I'm sorry. I can't talk to you right now.\"\n\"What's the matter? You got somebody in there?\"\nHe thought about it.\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I do. Be good and go away, and maybe it'll be you next time. Computer, close channel.\"\nErik felt like the ultimate weener even though he kept reminding himself that he had no real choice, not unless he wanted to do time for being a nice guy.\nDing Ding Ding\n\"Computer, modify defaults, channel visitor, attention off for one hour.\"\n\"Done.\"\nErik leafed through the folder, looking for the face. The image of the chiphead on his wall might have looked strangely familiar, but all he could focus on were the metallic head tricks and Cooper's little visit. No doubt she already suspected something. She was the type of person who would start asking questions. He dictated a quick request to have her transferred, finally leafing through the folder a second time, focusing on every detail in its proper order.\nIt contained typical restricted information: all sorts of facts, none of them useful, except one perhaps. The chiphead wasn't mentioned anywhere. Erik groaned, a sickened feeling sloshing over him. There was one more problem with the Commodore's plan, now painfully obvious. Destroying the ship meant destroying evidence about who this character was.\n\"Computer, open channel, voice only, medical section, Dr. Hunter.\"\nThe line clicked open with an audible pop.\n\"Sickbay, Sosrodjojo speaking.\"\n\"This is Lieutenant Torin. Is Dr. Hunter in?\"\n\"Um... I think she just stepped out. Can I take a message?\"\n\"I really need to speak to the patient.\"\nErik could almost see the nurse smiling on the other end, his voice lathered with amusement. He'd called before and talked to the same nurse at length. He knew what to expect.\n\"No can do, Lieutenant. He's still resting.\"\n\"When will he wake up?\"\n\"Ah... you'd have to talk to Dr. Hunter about that, but I'm sure she'll tell you try back no sooner than tomorrow.\"\nErik sighed, \"Okay, but there may be a problem with the patient. I want him moved to the cage.\"\n\"The cage? You really think that's necessary?\"\n\"I don't know, but I'd rather we took the precaution.\"\n\"Ah... very well. I'll call security.\"\nThe line closed with the same pop it made while connecting, and Erik scratched his head, staring at the image on the wall.\n\"Computer, locate person. Captain Dunham.\"\n\"Done.\"\n\"Say.\"\n\"Captain Dunham is on the main bridge.\"\nErik leaned back on the couch.\n\"Open channel, voice only, main bridge.\"\nThere was a short pause.\n\"Bridge.\"\n\"Get me the captain.\"\nErik sat back up when he heard the captain's deep, resonant voice.\n\"This is Dunham.\"\n\"Captain, this is Lieutenant Torin. I'm Commodore Reece's special attache.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"I need to talk to you.\"\n\"You can find me on the bridge. I'll arrange for your clearance if that's a problem.\"\n\"Clearance isn't a problem, Captain. I need to speak with you privately. There's a little discrepancy in the records we need to clear up.\"\n\"Ah... I doubt I can be of any help to you there, Lieutenant.\"\nErik rubbed his eyes, trying to think of some way to push nicely.\n\"It could be important, Captain. When can I meet you?\"\nHe heard a heavy breath on the other end.\n\"Alright, Lieutenant. My quarters. One hour.\"\n\"Thank you, Captain.\"\nErik spent his spare time walking the passenger decks. Without his uniform, he drew little attention and soon ended up in the Slippery Whisker, one of the Crimson Queen's less ritzy canteens. Cooper was probably down in engineering, he figured, reminding himself that he felt like dirt, though he knew he'd made the right choice.\nThe crowd was fairly thick, so he just ordered and drank, sitting alone in an alcove with his back to the wall. He preferred his little corner to the bar where masses of people pressed together without any semblance of order or civility. On this occasion, one rose above the rest, not so much in stature as in head gear. Erik watched the tall spokes on the man's head jiggle back and forth as he nodded to one of the bar wenches. It reminded him of John Doe, helping to focus his mind on the matter at hand, and the more he thought about it, the more it irked him.\nErik made his way back to officers' quarters and hung around in the lounge until Dunham showed up. The captain was early as well, though the bored look on his face didn't portray a man who was looking forward to this meeting. Rather, he seemed to just want to get it over with, as quickly as possible, and Erik wondered if his own presence on board represented some sort of threat. Over the years, he'd learned that many of the naval and quasi-naval officers didn't like ISIS, though they were the very people most often made to cooperate with the service. Erik had always figured it was because the Navy had it's own intelligence division, but nothing about the captain's mood betrayed professional jealousy.\n\"Enter.\"\nDunham's cabin was fairly unassertive. It could be called spartan, if not for the shimmer-sketches upon the wall. They were unsigned, though each revealed a similar style. Erik recognized one as being of the commodore. The picture depicted her on the observation deck, looking longingly into the studded darkness of space and at a world turning gently below.\n\"Your work, sir?\"\n\"A hobby of mine. It helps me relax.\"\nErik turned around.\n\"My reason for wanting to speak with you concerns a conversation you allegedly had with our lucky guest.\"\n\"Before you continue, Lieutenant, I must confess that it was hardly a conversation.\"\n\"Nevertheless, you did speak with him.\"\nDunham nodded, \"I've already reported that to the commodore.\"\n\"And you also reported that our guest told you that he was an ISIS operative.\"\n\"That's correct.\"\nErik paced to the corner of the room.\n\"Captain, this may seem a trivial question, but it's extremely important that we be absolutely clear on this.\"\n\"I've told you what I can.\"\n\"Think again. Try to remember his exact words. Did he say he was an ISIS operative or did he say that he was working with one?\"\n\"Lieutenant, you've got to understand that our lucky guest, as you call him, was not especially comprehensible. He was wounded. I could hear that his voice, even amidst the static, was fatigued. He was coughing between his words, and beyond that he was rather upset. In short, he was just barely making sense at all.\"\n\"You're telling me you don't know what he said.\"\n\"I'm telling you that what he said and what he meant may be two different creatures entirely. I asked him who he was. He replied that he was an ISIS operative, not that he was working for one. However, considering his physical state at the time, it wouldn't surprise me greatly if I was misinformed.\"\n\"You sure this is such a good idea?\"\nJohanes looked up, a little peeved that Cecil's spoke-headed disciple was having second thoughts.\n\"What are you bitching about? I'm the one who's drinking it.\"\nSpokes shrugged and continued stirring as Johanes turned up the particle stream, watching the bottom of the bowl with an increasingly intense stare. If it stopped simmering evenly it would be useless, and if it rose to a boil it would make him sick for at least a day. The trick was in getting it just right; such was the nature of Draconian toe-jam.\nIt was a temperamental and unusually fragile drug. Johanes remembered one instructor telling a class of recruits how home-made batches were held to spoil on the side of caution nine times out of ten, hence the Realm's enormous profits on their peculiar version, which was widely regarded as having the best trade-off between safety and potency. What naturally resulted was a \"get `em hooked and milk `em dry\" external revenue policy, while inside the Realm itself, the drug was taxed to extinction. Meanwhile, competitive operations were encircled and incorporated via the corporate state's ruthlessly legal policy of economic barbarism, or so Mike might have called it. Johanes gritted his teeth. He would find out soon, one way or the other.\n\"You'd better hurry on that,\" Cecil murmured from his corner of the room, his meditation seemingly concluded.\n\"You have the frequency and encryption set-up?\"\nThe cameras nodded as he flicked the little, communications package into the air, it's metallic casing no larger than a walnut. Johanes caught it in one hand, hoping sincerely it would come of some use.\n\"A little slower. You're cooling the outside too fast.\"\nSpokes shook his head, \"We should just fix some hellacious flamebowls and be done with it.\"\n\"I need some semblance of lucidity while I'm in there. If we do this right, I'm as sick as an Alfirinian marsh slog for half a cent, and after that, all I have to deal with are the vibes.\"\nSpokes grinned, \"Lucky bastard.\"\nJohanes nodded. His first two years of training included a fairly substantial appreciation of the drug culture, and the vibes were one of the loosest highs he had ever experienced. They were brought on by the interaction of the toe-jam and the body's own defense chemistry. They never encouraged paranoia, made him hyper or hallucinate, or even put him on planet nine. It was different. It was like being totally healthy, completely aware, and remarkably resonant to reality. In short, it was like not being stoned at all, except you were, but you wouldn't know it, and after a few times, just when you thought you'd gotten the hang of it, you'd wake up to the facts of addiction. He'd seen an acquaintance almost kill herself by quaffing an obviously burnt batch on purpose. Good ol' Souxie, she thought she could handle it, and here he was, practically thinking the same thing.\n\"If I don't come out of there after two cents, you tell the nurse on duty what I did, okay?\"\nSpokes nodded, not taking his eyes off his stirring, \"Sure. No problem.\"\n\"I'm serious.\"\n\"I know.\"\nBeep \"This is Captain Dunham. Before we enter hyperspace, I want to take this opportunity on behalf of myself and the crew to thank you for traveling with Royal Fleet. At this time, I would advise arosthoros sufferers to begin heading toward sickbay if they haven't done so already. We will be arriving at Tyber in roughly twenty-six standard hours. Until then, if we can do anything to make your voyage more pleasant, please do not hesitate to inquire with our attendants.\"\nJohanes shut down the heat, throwing a fist of ground ice into his highbowl.\n\"Okay. It's time.\"\nFeso grinned and made the mandatory jokes as he handed out the space sickness capsules with little paper cups of water. As usual, most of the passengers who showed up were over twice his age. They drank and smiled, nodding and thanking him for his trouble. One old lady even complemented him on his nice, white, lab coat. In short, all of them seemed happy, all of them except for one. He was roughly the same age as Feso himself, yet his face seemed ashen and worn, as if he was psyching himself up for the black plague. Feso put a gentle hand on his shoulder.\n\"Don't worry. You'll be just fine.\"\nBeing a nurse, Feso saw that sort of reaction all the time. In every batch of passengers, there would be at least one who would start getting sick scarce minutes before the jump into hyperspace. Dr. Hunter explained it away as being some sort of psychological, anal-retentive thing, but Feso could never help getting worried. Maybe they were carrying some dread illness. After all, it was impossible to screen everyone thoroughly.\nDr. Hunter always laughed his distress off as though he were making a joke. She thought he was funny and told him so, barking a string of new orders during the very next sentence. Fret was the natural consequence of an idle mind, in her book. Still, this guy looked different.\nConcerned undertones reverberated within the sickbay as everyone felt the disorientation. Several clung to the hand holds as their knees quaked back and forth, and one man, possibly in his nineties, sat down on the floor, blinking in confusion as the room swirled around him. Feso smiled, leaning next to him.\n\"Still with us?\"\n\"Eh?\"\nSome laughed, others leaving as they realized that the worst was over, and Feso helped the old man back to his feet who was now smiling at his part in the joke.\n\"Eh... I was just taking a breather.\"\n\"Yes. I noticed.\"\nFour of them stayed, the young man he was originally worried about included. Feso looked them over, feeling foreheads with his bare palm.\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"I still feel dizzy,\" one replied\n\"That's normal. Here, sit down. We have a medicinal compound already prepared that should get you back on your feet in no time.\"\nHe administered four injections, three of them seeming to have some small effect. The young man wasn't responding, however. He fidgeted in his seat, perspiration soaking his shirt as his face turned a rosy hue of red. He squinted up with dilated pupils.\n\"I'm gonna be sick.\"\n\"It's okay.\"\nFeso gave him another injection. The man started to lean over and drool on the floor.\n\"Ugghhh!\"\n\"Umm... okay. You're gonna be just fine.\"\n\"No I'm not.\"\n\"Just wait here.\"\n\"Where are you going?\"\nFeso ran to the office. Dr. Hunter was on the comm board, arguing with the bureaucracy as usual.\n\"There's a problem with one of the passengers.\"\nShe looked up as though expecting his outburst.\n\"Acute arosthoros?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"What code is the patient?\"\n\"Green.\"\nShe nodded, \"Double the injection.\"\n\"I already tripled it.\"\nDr. Hunter put the bureaucracy on hold and started across the room when she heard somebody vomiting on the floor. The man had fallen out of his seat, his face smeared with the contents of his stomach, while the other four passengers were alternating between looking away and sneaking peeks, their faces masked by utter revulsion. Only Hunter seemed unaffected.\n\"This isn't arosthoros.\"\n\"Then what is it?\"\n\"I don't know... yet. How long as he been doing this?\"\n\"About a minute.\"\nShe dragged the man to his feet, pulling him inside intensive care.\n\"Stay with the others. Don't let them leave.\"\nJohanes felt like he'd been turned inside-out and left to rot as she dumped him into the gravitic recliner. She immediately turned her back to him, turning knobs, pushing buttons, as he let loose with another volley from the interior of his stomach. The room seemed to turn around on him, flipping and flopping as blood rushed to his mouth, exiting through his nostrils and lips and washing itself over his face.\nHunter examined the readings, a perplexed look crossing her face. The man's defensive system was going wild. She held him down with a grip only taught in medical school and took a blood sample, stepping back to the analyzer with her trophy. The man continued to shake, his hair now soaked with sweat.\n\"Help...\"\n\"Quiet. I'm working.\"\nThe analyzer broke down the blood into its constituent parts, and the machine spat back readings she hadn't seen since the music festival on Satyr IV. She switched the IC open and groaned.\n\"You can let the others go, Nurse.\"\nFeso came darting in a minute later.\n\"What was it?\"\n\"See for yourself.\"\nShe put a pulse monitor around the patient's arm as Feso studied the output.\n\"Artificial contaminant of some kind.\"\n\"Yep. We've got ourselves a druggie.\"\nFeso breathed a deep sigh of relief, then turned around hoping she hadn't noticed. Hunter smiled up at him.\n\"It's okay. At least it wasn't a contagion, right?\"\nHe nodded and smiled, somewhat embarrassed, \"The possibility had crossed my mind.\"\n\"You always think that...\"\n\"And so far, I'm always wrong,\" he confessed, finishing the sentence for her. She pressed the ice pack to the back of the patient's neck as he continued to groan, trying in vain to force out the emptiness in his belly.\n\"He already has a lot of chemicals in his system, but I want you to administer a stabilizer. It may draw out his body's reaction to whatever he took, but at least it should keep him from getting any worse.\"\nFeso nodded, \"Somebody should watch him, right?\"\n\"You watch him. I don't have time for baby-sitting. I've got a call on hold.\"\n\"You want me to stay with him alone?\"\nHunter looked her nurse over, a slight frown creeping down her face.\n\"He's a grown man on drugs, Feso. He's harmless, not to mention pathetic.\"\n\"What if you're wrong?\"\n\"About him being harmless? Then you load up the hypo-rod and punch him with a canister of Teramethenol-12. That should keep him happy.\"\n\"If it doesn't kill him, first,\" Feso muttered, but she had already left. He prepared the stabilizer and administered it, though putting one drug on top of another was more his idea of recklessness than medicine. Hunter just wanted the bozo to suffer for a while longer. She knew that he wasn't in any real danger, and the pulse-monitor would keep an eye on him better than any human could.\nJohanes turned over, particles of vomit resting at his sides in the gravitic field. The noise of his breathing sounded parched and ragged behind the thumping in his ears, and the nurse stood over him, a concerned though unsympathetic look on the young man's face.\n\"How are you feeling, Mr. Smyth?\"\n\"Terrible. Is it over?\"\nFeso shook his head, \"I gave you a stabilizer. It seems to be bringing your pulse down, but you'll probably be sick for a while.\"\n\"Great.\"\n\"What did you take?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What drug did you take?\"\n\"Drug?\" Johanes tried to laugh, but it only made him feel worse. \"I thought I was space-sick.\"\n\"No. The doctor found some sort of drug in your system.\"\n\"Damn. No kidding. Must have been in that drink I had. Those Calannans sure do have a wicked sense of humor.\"\nFeso blinked, \"You mean you didn't even know?\"\n\"There was this little pre-jump party on the promenade deck. I guess things got a little out of hand. Uh oh...\" Johanes turned over and opened his mouth to heave. Only a rotting, stinking belch came out, the sort that gets holed-up in some damp recess of the stomach and refuses to poke its head out for weeks at a time. Feso leaned back once he got a whiff, squinting in extreme displeasure.\n\"Uh... I guess I can leave you alone for a little while. If you get into trouble, just call through the door. I'll leave it open, okay?\"\n\"No problem.\"\nJohanes switched off the gravitic recliner, settling to the sticky, white floor, now polka-dotted by various yellow and red particles of an origin he didn't wish to recall. Meanwhile, the computerized gadgetry continued to beep in time with his pulse. He walked over to it, toying with the dials as blood seeped from his nostrils and onto his lips while his tongue wagged back and forth, trying to avoid the awful taste.\n\"Remember, Jo. You gotta eat apples. They taste the same coming back up as they do going down. Two meals for the price of one.\" It was Souxie's voice in his head, as clear as the last time he'd heard it. Good ol' toe-jam.\nHe was relatively familiar with the operating system. He'd once used something remotely akin to it in a lab on Estin, except that the Draconian equipment was far more advanced. This was cruise liner material, a paltry product by any comparison. The medical console reported that a job was still in process: blood sample analysis, unknown compound recognition. He removed the sample tray, pocketing it and dumping the job out of queue. He then recalled the last minute of pulse readings from memory and set the playback into an infinite loop, tearing the pulse monitor off his arm as quietly as haste would allow.\nThe intensive care chamber was long and rectangular, the far wall coated with long plastic windows. A narrow corridor ran behind them, cutting a path between the antechamber and a row of laboratories. Behind the clear plastic barrier, Johanes could see someone dressed in a long white coat walking down the corridor, holding a stack of flimsies under one arm. The person seemed to be whistling, through from the behind the plastic, Johanes couldn't hear the noise, yet from the movement of the man's lips, he could still pick up the basic rhythm. The lips were cherry hued, like the front of his shirt, though that used to be white. He remembered how it had been so thoroughly cleaned at the Arien estate. Kori had shoved him into the moat just for kicks. She'd later asked him how he'd felt when the mansion's mascot dragged him beneath the water in one, swift, tug of a tentacle. It was only playing, she tried to explain, and they laughed, though he'd been rather annoyed at the time.\nJohanes blinked, ducking to his belly. He'd probably been standing there looking stupid for close to a minute, maybe longer. He tried to focus his mind, but it kept on going off on tangents. The intrusion of the stabilizer, he figured. Planet nine would pass by, he reassured himself, as he started noticing the little cracks in the tile, the variations in the shape of one from another. He crawled about the chamber, his eyes examining everything in sight, as he investigated his new surroundings cubicle by cubicle like a cockroach in search of sustenance.\nAt the far end he found what he was looking for. The pulse monitor made no noise, but from the little jumping dot on the console, he could tell that somebody in the bed was alive. He drew Mike's fiberglass pistol, a little memento he'd been saving for a special occasion, and standing over the bedside, pulled the sheets down slowly with his free hand. The headjacks came as somewhat of a shock, as he fully expected to find a white mane instead. Holding his breath, he pulled the sheet a little further.\n\"Michael.\"\nThere was no response, and Johanes grinned as he re-concealed the firearm, shaking the gatherer by the shoulder.\n\"C'mon. Wake up.\"\nFrom the antechamber he could hear voices, one of them a woman's, strangely familiar.\n\"We'd rather wait until he's awake before we start moving him around. Besides, he's safer in intensive care. If something goes wrong, we can treat him better in there than in the cage.\"\n\"Look, doctor. I have direct orders to make sure he gets moved, so he's getting moved. End of story.\"\n\"I understand, but he's still at a very critical stage in the healing process. Why is it so important that he be moved now?\"\n\"Right. Let me try put this as succinctly as possible. He gets moved now. We are not having a discussion about it. If you want to stomp on me, fine. Call my commanding officer and bitch. I don't care. I have my orders. Nothing personal, okay?\"\n\"You people haven't even given me his medical records. We have no idea what sort of prior conditions might exist. If he's not inside intensive care, I can't assume responsibility for what might happen.\"\n\"Fine. That's great. Like I said before, I don't really care what happens to him.\"\nThe security officer entered the chamber, turning first toward the beeping noise and then to his left.\n\"My oh my. What happened to this fella?\"\n\"Ah....\"\n\"Space-sickness,\" Feso interrupted.\n\"No. Really?\"\nHunter stood quietly, watching her nurse beneath an arched eyebrow. The security officer just laughed.\n\"I never knew it got that bad. I mean, not on a ship like this, anyway. Back when I was serving in the navy, one of our engineers had to crawl outside while we were in the middle of hyperspace. Very serious repairs. Okay? And he puked his guts out after we pulled him back in. Just between us, I don't think he ever really recovered, neither. And the janitors! I mean barf-orama, okay? And they were just a bunch of robots, and they still got pissed. You know when your robots start getting pissed off, you've got some serious...\"\n\"How fascinating.\"\n\"Yeah, and this other time...\"\n\"The patient is over there. Please, just move him.\"\nJohanes let the pulse monitor fall again from his arm as they walked past, dumping the playback job and the rest of the computer's soft-memory with a silent turn of a power switch. He then stopped the nurse, who was trailing behind the other two.\n\"Real sorry about the mess.\"\n\"Aw... don't worry about it. We have nicer robots than the navy.\"\n\"Great. Look, I'm gonna get back to that party.\"\n\"No. You can't leave.\"\n\"Sorry. Got to. We ordered a hermaphrodite stripper, and I really don't want to miss it. Thanks.\"\n\"But...\"\nJohanes scampered out of sickbay before Feso could utter another word. Spokes was sitting on a bench nearby, trying desperately to hide inconspicuously behind a king-sized flimsi and a pair of mirrored stick-on shades. If not for the head jacks poking above the flimsi leaf, he might of succeeded, but as it was, he made less than the perfect spy. For starters, he was too honest.\n\"You look like garbage and smell like stomach swill.\"\nJohanes grinned, \"Compliments will get you everywhere.\"\n\"Damn. You must be having a good high.\"\n\"No, it evaporated, which is fine because it was pretty rotten while it lasted. They injected me full of stabilizers.\"\n\"Tough luck.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\n\"You take care of business?\"\nJohanes shrugged, \"I think Michael beat me to the punch. They're moving him right now.\"\n\"What do we do?\"\n\"You keep your eyes peeled. I'm going to take a shower.\"\nJim Vassilakos (jimv@ucrengr.ucr.edu) works part-time as a programmer at a place so cheesy that he declined to mention the name.

He closed his hand into a fist as a beeping noise rose Jim Vassilakos somewhere in the distance. Then the lights came on, and he squinted, barely able to see at all. \"Good morning.\"\n\"Lemme see.\"\nMike's first impulse was to clasp his hand into a tight fist. She tried prying back his fingers one by one, but each time she got one where she wanted it, she'd have to let it go to work on another. \"Dummy,\" he thought, as it would snap back down, and she'd scream and then laugh, frustrated and easily amused.\n\"Mike... please. I'm gonna tell mom.\"\n\"Tell her what? I found it.\"\n\"I just want to look at it.\"\nHe held its edge between two fingers, its coppery color reflecting the late afternoon sunlight. Some sort of profile lay etched on the side, a man with a beard, all distinguished and stately. She squinted, trying to make out the details as he jiggled it back and forth, forcing her eyes to constantly refocus. Finally giving up, she tried to grab it. \"Slowpoke,\" he thought as he felt a snickering smile form on his lips.\n\"I have all. You have none.\"\n\"Mike...\" she started to whine.\n\"Oh, don't cry, baby. You want it?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I bet you do.\"\nShe ended up chasing him around the flat, underneath tables, through the shower, over their parents' bed, until she finally cornered him at the balcony, hazel eyes deadly serious.\n\"Gimme it or else.\"\n\"If you insist.\"\nHe made as if to hand it forward, but just at her moment of triumph, he flicked it backwards over his head. It was over twenty stories down.\n\"Mike... I'm telling.\"\nShe never did, of course. She never told about anything, while he would tell about almost anything, even the stuff he made up.\n\"Mommy already knows you're a big fat liar.\"\n\"Does not... uh.... Am not.\"\nHe didn't know why she held her tongue. He never really thought about it. He knew it was a good thing though. She'd certainly collected enough dirt over the years to put him on life-long restriction.\n\"Where you going?\"\nHe froze, his lower torso hanging out the ventilation shaft. It wasn't the first time she'd pretended to be asleep. He looked down, uncertain.\n\"Nowhere.\"\n\"I'll tell.\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\nHe stopped once he reached the roof. She was at his heels, hazel eyes shimmering faintly in the starlight. Mike scowled. A tag-along was just what he needed.\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" he queried in his most accusatory voice.\n\"Where are you going?\" she chirped in reply.\n\"Nowhere.\"\n\"I'm going nowhere too.\"\nHe gritted his teeth, walking over to the old staircase. He'd busted the lock on the door with his father's gun while nobody was home to hear the noise. His dad never even noticed the bullet missing.\nMike told her to go back at least twenty times on the way to the ground floor. It wasn't that she'd get him caught. Sneaking past the security-bot wasn't a problem. The thing was stupid, and he'd learned long ago how to distract it with a pebble. It was just the idea of her company which irritated him.\nShe walked behind him once they were outside, picking up funny shaped stones or bits of metal. She even found a coin, probably the one he'd tossed over the balcony. They ended up going into one of the deserted buildings at her insistence. She wanted to find something hard and flat to spin it on. Mike suggested her head, which she didn't find funny.\nThey must have sat there for hours while she twirled it with glee and wouldn't let him touch it for all the false promises in the world. He watched her, his eyelids growing increasingly heavy as he reminded himself that they couldn't fall asleep. Without her in the room, there would be nobody to cover for him in the morning. Still, she seemed too happy to budge. She finally looked up, waking him from his pseudo-slumber.\n\"Remember Dana?\"\nMike looked at her and yawned, \"Haven't seen her in awhile.\"\n\"Mom said her family must've moved, but I went over the other day, and her older sister answered the door. Said she wasn't living there anymore.\"\n\"Maybe she got the bug.\"\nThat made her pause, but then she looked up again, \"I don't see how she could have. She hardly ever went out. Her dad wouldn't let her.\"\nMike sat upright on the floor, crossing his legs.\n\"Sounds almost like Jason.\"\nLei twirled the coin again.\n\"Yeah. Before his parents moved, he said they were leaving because of him and that I should go too. Because we were both second-born.\"\n\"Second-born?\"\n\"I know. I asked mom what he meant. She said they were really leaving because his parents couldn't face their chores.\"\nA goo-spitter crept beside her leg while she was talking. Mike flicked a string of pebbles at it until it got the hint and crawled away. She didn't seem to notice and just kept twirling the coin.\n\"Mom said some people just hide from real life. Isn't that weird?\"\n\"I guess.\"\nShe was quiet for a while after that, and Mike closed his eyes wondering what the big people were up to.\n\"Mike. Wake up!\"\nHis eyes snapped open but saw nothing save for a blue dot in the distance, jumping like the beat to a really slow song. His mouth felt strange, almost swollen, and his body felt warm and numb, as though he'd melted into the concrete. It took about a minute before he realized there was something in his mouth. He spat it out gently, feeling it brush by his arm several moments later. With considerable concentration, his hand found it somewhere in the darkness. It was about the size of a walnut, cold and metallic. He closed his hand into a fist as a beeping noise rose somewhere in the distance. Then the lights came on, and he squinted, barely able to see at all.\n\"Good morning.\"\nIt was a woman's voice, detached yet strangely familiar. She sounded a little tired as her face blurred in and out of focus.\n\"How are you feeling?\"\nShe wiped his eyes with some sort of sticky, gauze pad, and Mike could see her short, dark hair as she leaned forward again, looking into his eyes with an elongated, metal instrument.\n\"Do you know where you are?\"\nMike thought about it.\n\"No.\"\n\"You're on the Crimson Queen... Royal Fleet passenger liner. You're safe.\"\nShe put something on his head and then pressed a few buttons. A twisted red line appeared on the display, sparking to mind images of floating bubbles, crimson and boiling. Mike blinked as she turned back around.\n\"Do you remember anything?\"\n\"Umm...\"\nFor some reason, he found himself imagining her with long, white hair. Her eyes were light brown, like a tiger's. Not silver, like Sule's. He blinked again as the memories came rushing with neither heed nor invitation.\n\"Do you know who you are?\"\n\"Mi...\" he bit his tongue. \"My head feels... kinda woozy.\"\n\"It's okay. Just rest. If you need anything,\" she tapped a red button beside his fist. \"Lights dim,\" she commanded.\nThey obeyed, and she seemed to have to play with the door, making it beep several times before it would open. A man wearing a holster stood on the other side, smiling and sneaking a peek. Then the door closed again, and Mike saw a small number pad nested into the wall beside it.\nThe object in his hand was metallic with two small holes set into one face. A moon-shaped etching lay beneath them, making a smiling face of the trio, and the words \"try me\" were carefully etched along the adjoining side. Frowning, Mike raised it carefully to his head, using his fingers to find the appropriate jacks. His arm felt strangely disconnected, as though half the nerves were deadened, and it took considerable fumbling before the device agreed click into its proper place. The lights seemed to stutter for a moment, and sitting somewhere within one wall, he could see the pair of dancing yellow lanterns.\n\"Cecil, what's going on?\"\n\"Speak with your mind, my friend. You are in the gravest danger yet.\"\nMike tried to shrug, but his shoulders barely responded, so he just sat still as the lanterns continued to swirl, beckoning attention.\n\"The Imps believe you are working with ISIS. They think it is you who summoned them to Sule's rescue. It is only a matter of time before they learn the truth.\"\n\"Where am I?\"\n\"The cage, the Crimson Queen's high security section of sickbay.\"\n\"Are we in hyperspace?\"\n\"En route to Tyber.\"\nMike took a deep breath, \"No wonder I'm having weird dreams.\"\nThe lanterns halted their dance, mid-stride.\n\"Dreams?\"\n\"Realistic, actually. Ever hear of delayed action re-play?\"\n\"Ah... understood.\"\nMike sighed. Cecil knew him too well.\n\"What's our ETA?\"\n\"Fifteen hours.\"\n\"Anybody with you?\"\nThe lanterns danced again, \"The whole team, Pooper-dumper included.\"\n\"Does anyone have any ideas for getting me out of here?\"\n\"Brain cells be burning over it. Trust in that.\"\n\"Could you be more specific?\"\n\"Locks on doors, for starters. Codes to enter, unknown.\"\nMike smirked, \"Unknown? To the ultimate hack?\"\n\"Hack Cecil could, but not quietly. Not on this boat, and certainly not concerning their prize jewel.\"\nTheir prize jewel. Mike savored the sound of it as his smirk decomposed itself into a sullen stare.\n\"I'll get the combo. You guys figure out how to use it. Okay?\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nMike disengaged the radio from his jacks, using several minutes debating where to hide it. Precious little was sacred in a hospital null, particularly one in which your every bodily function was monitored by various medical gadgetry. Even a woman doctor would have to get intimate from time to time. He finally settled on wedging it beneath the upper-torso sheath between his armpit and the castfoam, pressing the red button almost as a after-thought. A young man entered the room a minute later. He wore a white coat with snake insignia and had a soft, friendly face.\n\"Ah... Lieutenant Feso Sosrodjojo at your service.\"\nMike tried to grin, \"Lieutenant, I can barely move.\"\n\"That's just the regen compound doing its work. It contains a mild paralytic.\"\n\"Take me off it.\"\n\"Ah... I can't do that.\"\n\"Lieutenant, don't make me pull rank here. Can you at least take me off the paralytic?\"\nHe sighed, \"If you don't mind pain, sure.\"\nMike nodded, \"I'd also like to see myself. If you have a mirror somewhere...\"\n\"No problem. I'll be right back.\"\nA minute later, Mike discovered the nurse true to his word.\n\"Why are you being so nice to me, Feso?\"\n\"Ah... you're Mr. Important, right? I see Lieutenant Torin always asking about you. He's very tight with the Commodore, I hear.\" He grinned knowingly, his eyebrows arching as if to say \"nudge nudge... wink wink.\" Then he smiled, sort of shyly. \"No, I'm always nice to the patients. It helps people heal, and you need all the healing you can get.\"\n\"What I need is to be able to move.\"\n\"Ah... you can move your arm and head.\"\n\"I want to be able to move my body. I want to be able to do my own digestion and defecation instead of these machines. Can you take me out of the body sheath?\"\n\"Ah... I don't think that would be such a good idea.\"\n\"Please?\"\nErik knew he'd overslept even before he was moderately conscious. He'd woken at his usual time several hours earlier, and recalling the previous night's excitement, promptly closed his eyes. It was a nice change, he decided, though a little too habit forming.\n\"Computer. Reinstate program wake-me.\"\n\"Done. You have messages waiting.\"\n\"Say messages, list.\"\n\"Commodore's quarters. Medical department, check-in desk. Custodial department, laundry section. Done.\"\n\"Laundry?\"\n\"Illegal command ignored.\"\n\"Say messages, all.\"\n\"Lieutenant, I am eagerly awaiting a report concerning you-know-who. Make sure I am fully briefed by the time we arrive at Tyber.\"\nHe groaned.\nBlip\n\"Hi. Lieutenant Torin, this is Sosrodjojo over at sickbay. In case you haven't gotten word yet, I figured I should let you know before my shift ends. That patient of yours has woken up, and he seems completely cognizant as far as I can determine. You know, because the first thing they do usually is to start complaining. Anyway, I just thought you'd want to know as soon as possible. Bye now.\"\nBlip\n\"Hello. This is Chief Ater. We had an interesting time removing those seal-it patches off the fleximesh you sent us. I just wanted to let you know, Lieutenant, that there was a Draconian service insignia underneath. Showed up on the computer as external intelligence branch. I took the liberty of forwarding a memo up the chain of command, but I figured I should at least clue you in as well. Oh, and by the way, we figured out that we can't repair it on-board, but I'd like to shuttle it down to Tyber when we arrive and see what we can do with it on planet.\"\nBlip \"There are no more messages.\"\n\"Erase messages, all.\"\nErik crawled out of the null tube and showered, whipping out his clearance badge as he entered the cage's guard room scarce minutes later.\n\"Hold it there, Mister.\"\nHunter's hair was slicked back from perspiration, and Erik guessed that she probably just finished her mid-morning workout. Rumor had it she kept a pair of grav-weights in her desk, and though he'd never confirmed it one way or the other, he'd read that some of the new-school, hands-on surgeons were taking up martial arts for their nerves. Either way, she looked pumped-up enough to belt him one.\n\"Where do you think you're going?\"\nHe put on his best smile, \"Where's it look like I'm going?\"\n\"It looks like you're trying, rather foolishly I might add, to sneak into the cage.\"\n\"How observant of you.\"\n\"Don't even think it. I have a patient in there who needs his sleep.\"\n\"Doctor, this will only take a moment. Open the door.\"\n\"Don't open it. Lieutenant, the answer is emphatically no.\"\nThe guard looked between them, obviously befuddled. Erik knew she out-ranked him, but he also knew that he had the power of God to call upon for all the guard was concerned. He pulled the writ from his shin pocket.\n\"You see this?\"\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\"You see the seal?\"\n\"Yessir.\"\n\"You recognize it?\"\n\"Yessir!\"\n\"Open the door.\"\nDr. Hunter stood behind, her mouth gaping open with a string of saliva ready to spill to the floor.\n\"Nobody ever told me that ISIS was involved!\"\n\"You never asked, and keep your voice down.\"\nThe guard began punching in the access number once they reached the cell.\n\"The door can only be opened from this side. The number is two-four-one-five-three. You key it in from the other side, and it'll tell me that you've entered it correctly. Then I key it on this side, and the door opens.\"\n\"Keep it open until I say otherwise.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\nThe cell door slid into the wall, and Erik entered, followed by a pair of irate footsteps. Her patient was reclining diagonally in the gravitic null, his body sheath laying along the wall behind him. A short, folded chair rested against the near corner, a mirror propped against one of its legs, and another chair, unfolded, sat facing him directly as though he were fully expecting the intrusion. He smiled, his head jacks gleamed in the eerie, turquoise light.\n\"Lieutenant Torin, I take it.\"\nErik sat down, Hunter preferring to stand and look threatening.\n\"Why are you out of your body sheath?\"\nThe patient shrugged, a pained wince traveling the length of his face, \"I no longer required it.\"\n\"I'll be the judge of that. I can't believe Feso didn't tell me he did this. Has he been administering the regen compound?\"\n\"More or less.\"\n\"More or less?\"\nShe examined the playback for all of two seconds.\n\"What happened to the paralytic?\"\n\"I needed to move.\"\n\"Moving is exactly what you don't need. Mister... Mister Doe, you have been shot several times.\"\n\"Twice. Only two got through.\"\n\"Only two?! Look Mister... whoever the hell you are! If you saw yourself yesterday dripping in blood...\"\nErik broke in, \"Doctor! Please.\"\n\"Lieutenant...\"\n\"Doctor, this is a very unusual patient. Please allow him a moment or two of insanity. I can assure you, it comes with the territory.\"\n\"I will not put up with...\"\n\"Due to security matters, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"I am asking, Doctor. Please, don't force me to go further.\"\nTiger-eyes glared down on him, \"I don't care what kind of connections you have, Torin. This is coming around. You hear me?\"\n\"Fine. Get her out of here.\"\nShe left before the guard could muster the courage, and Erik made a toothy grin, the sort he used to practice in front of a mirror just to break up his buddies during oral exams.\n\"Guard, you can close the door now. So...\"\n\"So...\"\n\"How was Calanna?\"\nMike frowned, \"Difficult.\"\n\"Really. I would never have guessed.\"\n\"Lieutenant, why am I being locked up?\"\n\"Precautions. For your own safety, mainly. After all, how often do we get a genuine ISIS operative on board? And that's not even considering the valuable information which you carry... yes?\"\nMike nodded, \"Yes, but you may be under a misconception. I'm not an operative.\"\n\"Who are you?\"\nHe took a deep breath, hoping his scratchy, wounded voice sounded convincing.\n\"The name's Mikaelis Caiton. I was originally one of John Clay's men.\"\n\"DSS?\"\n\"No. Far from it. I was working only for John. He brought me over from Tizar to keep an eye on Ambassador Kato, but somehow one of your operatives, her name was Sule... no last name, I guess... somehow she found out about me and basically made an offer I couldn't refuse.\"\n\"What sort of an offer?\"\n\"Initiation into ISIS.\"\n\"She doesn't have that authority, Mr. Caiton.\"\n\"Call me Mikaelis.\"\n\"She lied to you.\"\n\"I'm not surprised. Do you want to hear the rest or not?\"\n\"Please.\"\n\"First, what are you willing to offer me?\" Mike grinned, his question a little too direct. Erik grinned back.\n\"Look, Mikaelis. If I wanted to, I could just burn the information from your brain.\"\nMike dropped his grin, \"Well, if you put it that way... I started working as a liaison between Clay and your people and managed to escape when things eventually went down on Calanna.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Clay turned triple agent on us. He sacrificed his own life in that nuclear incident you no doubt heard about and managed to kill Erestyl and destroy the ISIS headquarters in a single, calculated strike.\"\nErik sat back, utterly befuddled.\n\"How did you escape?\"\n\"Luck. Sule dumped a copy of our mind scanner readings to crystal. I then accompanied her to the starport to deposit them into an interstellar postal envelope. She doesn't like to take chances; that's one thing I liked about her.\"\n\"How did you get wounded?\"\n\"Two of Clay's goons tried to make short work of us at the starport. They were locals. Real temporary hires. They didn't even know their source of income had already reduced himself to a jumble of sub-molecular particles. Really tacky way to go, if you ask me.\"\n\"And what about Sule?\"\n\"She was wounded also. We managed to get to a starship, but its occupants weren't too crazy to have us there. She fought well, but...\"\nErik took a deep breath, trying to digest the story as quickly as Mike had made it up.\n\"Where's the envelope addressed to?\"\n\"If I tell you that, what keeps you from just killing me?\"\nErik shrugged, \"Nothing. You're going to have to trust me.\"\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\"Perhaps you should. It could be your last opportunity... to think I mean.\"\nMike nodded, \"I'll take you to it, but not until I have a chance to at least introduce myself to your superiors. If you find that unreasonable, then take your chances with the mind scanner, and I'll take mine.\"\nBlue light shifted along the Lieutenant's features as he considered the offer. He finally stood up.\n\"I should warn you that insolence is not tolerated in ISIS.\"\n\"Neither is stupidity,\" Mike countered, \"at least according to Sule.\"\nErik keyed in the combination as he reached the door, oblivious to the shift in his prisoner's gaze. After the door closed again, Mike stumbled over to the folded chair, taking the mirror and placing it flat against the metal deck. Amidst all the gleaming silver, it had either gone unnoticed or been disregarded as trivial. He took a deep breath and re-attached the radio. It took a minute before Cecil's dancing, yellow lanterns returned.\n\"Greetings.\"\n\"Greetings yourself. I got it. It's two-four-one-five-three.\"\n\"Copy that. You'll be out in no time.\"\nThe lanterns disappeared, and Mike disengaged the radio from his jacks, hiding it again while wondering how long \"no time\" would take.\nIt was just a little blinker. To anyone else on the bridge, it would have been beneath notice, but Tabor knew what it meant. He'd just barely finished re-configuring his display for that one little light. His personal message board began scrawling letters almost immediately. \"There. See that?\"\nHe opened a channel to engineering. Nakaguchi was talking on the other end even before the line opened.\n\"...just like I said. Did you catch it?\"\nTabor smiled, \"I see it,\" though he had to admit to himself that he could scarcely believe it. \"What do you think is causing it?\"\n\"You're the communications genius. You tell me.\"\nTabor imported the section of hyperfield fractometer readings which his configuration had obligingly saved narrow seconds before they would have been consigned to electronic oblivion with the rest of the computer's standard erasures. With a few key strokes, he converted the data to a graph, and his eyes grew wide at the puzzling image. Nakaguchi was right. It was pure chaos, except for those few seconds where a series of peaks and troughs appeared with perfectly equidistant delays.\n\"You see it?\"\n\"Yeah. I see it, alright. I just don't know what it is.\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"What?\"\nNakaguchi laughed, \"It's the slogs of space.\"\n\"You're doing this, aren't you? This is a joke.\"\n\"A sick and dangerous joke.\"\n\"Well, somebody's doing it. This does not happen naturally.\"\n\"That's what I've been telling you. You should have seen it last time. It went on for more than a minute. I wish I was ready for it. I would have saved it.\"\nTabor nodded, \"I wish you had. A few seconds isn't much to go on. I'll get back to you if I figure anything out.\"\n\"You do that.\"\nThe line closed with a fitful pop, and Tabor began running the standard code-cracker routines. Lish looked up, yawning contagiously. They'd both got on duty less than an hour ago, and her sleepiness had been infectious until now.\n\"What's up?\"\n\"Got a little mystery.\"\n\"Well, it's no mystery to me. I know how men are. Oooh, you think you're tough, don't you?\"\nCarla retaliated with a full round kick, knocking Hunter back at least four feet. The doctor didn't even seem fazed.\n\"I'm telling you, it was infuriating.\"\n\"Well, don't take it out on me, sister.\"\n\"Why not?!\"\nCarla had to duck and then some, finally retreating to her safe corner.\n\"Alice, you bitch, you are in a bad mood.\"\n\"Don't call me that.\"\n\"Hey, it's okay. I'm one too. I freely admit it. Now if only we could get all men to admit they're assholes, the universe might be an honest place to live.\"\n\"No... I mean don't call me Alice.\"\n\"It's your name, ain't it?\"\n\"Stop gabbing and fight.\"\nCarla kept to the defensive. She could tell her favorite karate student was out for bloody, no-holds-barred aggression, and it was a beautiful sight.\n\"You keep on like this, and I'm gonna have you in the tournament. Talk about focus. The only problem is that you're so pissed, you aren't thinking.\"\nShe dished back just what the doctor ordered, except that Hunter didn't know it until she was already on the floor, dazed, Carla's foot scrunching down on her nose.\n\"Damn.\"\n\"Ha! And you thought you had me. Didn't you?\"\nHunter stood up, rubbing the leg which took the brunt of the take-down.\n\"For maybe half a second.\"\n\"Longer than that. You were getting wicked, woman.\"\n\"I have good reason to be wicked.\"\n\"Yeah, well... you have to think and be wicked at the same time. Once you have that down, all men better run and hide.\"\nHunter smiled. It had taken a while, but Carla was finally getting to her. She always knew the doctor's weak spots.\n\"I didn't say all men.\"\n\"No, but that is what you mean. C'mon girl. You don't have to pretend different. I know.\"\nHunter shrugged, picking up a towel, \"It's just that they're so stupid.\"\n\"Ain't that the truth.\"\n\"They refuse to listen to reason. They're pig-headed.\"\n\"I heard that right. Hey, where's that come from, anyway?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Pig-headed.\"\n\"You never heard of pigs?\"\n\"No.\"\nHunter started to laugh, except that she was too angry and couldn't sustain it, so it just came out like all wrong, like a pig's snort. Carla watched her, a hurt scowl crossing her brow.\n\"What's that supposed to mean? I'm stupid or something? Listen girl, just because not everybody goes to college for ten years...\"\n\"No... I didn't mean it like that. Pigs are proto-slogs. That's just the sound they make.\"\nCarla looked at her again, that strange sort of smile forming along her lips like she figured she was being lied to for the fun of it.\n\"I can do that. Listen...\" snort \"Hey, this is great.\" snort snort\n\"You're a real natural.\"\n\"I've always been able to make that noise. That's a pig noise?\"\nHunter nodded, \"I friend of mine was doing her dissertation on some of the old DNA samples. They were supposedly brainy animals for their time.\"\nsnort snort\n\"You should have been a science major, Carla.\"\n\"I'll pass on that. The closest I ever got to science was a psychology class they made me take. It was real cheesy. For the final project, we had to find some sort of phenomena and explain it, okay?\"\n\"Uh oh...\"\n\"So, this guy in our co-op, he was my subject, except he didn't know it. See? Every time he got hungry, he would go over to the cold food locker, open it up, and just sort of stare inside like some meal was going to jump out at him all of a sudden and make itself. You ever see men do this?\"\n\"Not really.\"\n\"Well, they do. If you ever bothered to just watch people, you will notice a lot of men exhibiting this sort of behavior. And it wasn't like it wasn't his food. It was everybody's food.\"\n\"Okay. So what was your explanation?\"\n\"The cold.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The cold air hitting his stomach caused it to shrink, and so by standing in front of the thing while it was open, he actually reduced the amount of free space in his stomach. How ya like it?\"\nHunter smiled sympathetically, \"What grade did you get?\"\n\"It went down as an incomplete. The professor advised me to forget about the sciences and take some trig to cover the slot. Can't say I'm sorry. I'm pretty damn good at what I do.\"\n\"When do you use trig?\"\n\"When is your friend ever gonna meet a pig?\"\nHunter pondered Carla's eccentric sort of logic on the way back to sickbay. It was already an hour into her sleep shift, but she felt determined to immobilize her patient even if it meant chaining him to the wall and whipping him with warm squash, and ditto for Lieutenant Torin if he was unfortunate enough to still be loitering in the general vicinity. Her thoughts were cut short by the door, however, or more specifically, by it's remaining closed as she tried to walk through it. She picked herself off the floor, holding her bruised nose in one hand as she looked around to see if anybody had witnessed her comedic display of dexterity.\nSickbay was never locked. She slid her ID through the scanner slot, but the door refused to budge, defiant and imposing as never before. She considered kicking it, but buried the notion in her list of unspent aggressions.\nShe finally hit the white comm-switch on the right.\n\"Can somebody open the door, please?\"\nThe security button beckoned. She hit the white switch again, closing the line and hit the red switch with an angry jab of her thumb.\n\"Security?\"\nThe door slid compliantly into the wall, and a tall, lanky figure stood before her. Behind the black face mask, soft blue eyes seemed to rotate within their sockets. She didn't even feel the two darts hitting her stomach until a pair of gloved hands caught her fall and carried her gently inside.\n\"Who... what...\"\nThe doorway began to spin and blur, and as the walls closed quietly upon her, she heard a grainy voice reverberate somewhere in the hazy distance.\n\"This is security.... Please identify yourself. Hello?\"\nThe Commodore leaned back, seemingly impressed with the story, and Erik hoped she wouldn't ask about specifics. He was still fuzzy on the details, himself.\n\"Let me get this straight. He wants an interview?\"\nErik shrugged, \"He wants into ISIS... or so he purports.\"\nShe frowned, glancing at the wall image of Roxanne's Palace on Tyber. Computer generated banks of orange, acid smog blew past the structure's summit, somehow clouding her eyes with memories of the sunrise on Calanna.\n\"Commodore?\"\n\"Even had I the clout, I wouldn't use it. It's not like the Navy. ISIS doesn't take applications. Besides, he's too attached to Clay, who already proved himself a traitor after we had trusted him.\"\n\"According to Caiton.\"\n\"The more I think about it, the more difficult I find it to believe this Mikaelis Caiton. Why did Clay expose his entire network on Tizar if he was never with us? As a sacrifice?\"\nErik nodded, \"Perhaps.\"\n\"No. Even were they all discards, what did he have to gain by risking Erestyl?\"\n\"He managed to destroy the operation of Calanna.\"\n\"A minuscule victory entirely beneath mention. He won nothing. This prisoner would have us believe that he sacrificed his life and risked Erestyl for nothing. Preposterous.\"\n\"Maybe Clay had second thoughts. That's the only explanation.\"\nReece cast him a cool stare, \"There is another. He could be making the whole thing up.\"\n\"Too many pieces fit. He knows a great deal. He must have been on the inside.\"\nShe nodded, \"That is all he has told us. Nothing more.\"\n\"Still, given the possibility that he's telling us the truth, shouldn't we at least humor him?\"\n\"Yes. We should. Regardless, I do want to meet him. If nothing else, a more thorough questioning might serve to reveal who he really is.\"\nBeep\n\"Reece here.\"\n\"This is Dunham. There's been an incident at sickbay. Your John Doe has escaped.\"\nReece looked up, eyes cold as ice.\n\"On my way.\"\nHunter awoke in the infirmary, a swarm of stewards and part-time medics darting frantically from null to null. They dressed the patients with neurogram napkins and monitored pulse rates, such was the extent of their training. She heard Feso's voice somewhere in the back of the room, delivering instructions while donning a white service coat over his red and pink striped pajamas, the only calm voice amidst a babble of cacophony.\n\"Well look who's among the living.\" He quickly stepped over, reaching for her arm as she tried to sit upright. \"There, Doctor. Just let it pass.\"\n\"The living?\"\n\"Don't worry. Everyone seems fine.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"You tell me. I just got here.\"\nShe glanced over his shoulder as the haze slowly dissipated from her mind. Commodore Reece stood with the Captain and Lieutenant Torin near the main desk, a first-class power-huddle if she'd ever seen one.\n\"You didn't tell me we had guests.\"\n\"Doctor...\"\n\"C'mon.\"\nShe tore the napkin from her forehead and began traversing the distance with Feso's shoulder in tow, not a mean task considering his reluctance. It wasn't that he minded substituting for a pair of crutches. On the contrary, he'd do anything to help a patient. His hesitation was founded in cowardice, the prospect of interrupting an impromptu executive conference rating somewhere between jamming his finger in an iris valve and taking a long walk out a short airlock.\n\"Doctor, this is not such a good idea. You should lay back down and rest.\"\n\"Steady, Feso. You drop me and it goes on your permanent record.\"\nThe Commodore was spitting out orders left and right, her voice crisp and determined and more than a little peeved.\n\"I want his image circulated among the crew. Also, post armed stewards at the lifts and escalators. Shoot to maim.\"\nShoot to maim?\n\"Excuse me, sir. Might somebody tell me what's going on?\"\n\"Your patient has escaped, Doctor. What do you last remember?\"\nHunter took a deep breath and let go of Feso's shoulder.\n\"I was trying to enter sickbay, and the door was locked for some reason. I opened a channel to security. Then the door opened and... everything went black.\"\n\"Hypo darts. You took a double tap in the belly. Did you get a look at him?\"\n\"I... remember a face mask.\"\n\"We found this in your hand.\"\nReece handed her a flimsi, glowing pink letters scrawled across its face: \"If you ever want to see me again, don't conduct a search. It's tacky, and you'll only inconvenience the passengers, particularly if you get too close to me.\"\nErik broke in, \"Commodore...\"\nReece put up a steady hand.\n\"Do you have any idea why this was left in your hand, Doctor?\"\n\"I was the ranking officer.\"\n\"Did anyone besides the medical staff and guard have access to the prisoner?\"\n\"Lieutenant Torin.\"\n\"Any passengers?\"\n\"No sir.\"\nReece pressed her lips together, \"One more question, Doctor. Is he well enough to survive without medical attention?\"\n\"That depends, sir.\"\n\"Give me an educated guess.\"\n\"Assuming there are no complications, yes.\"\n\"Complications?\"\n\"He's very weak. When the regen-compound wears off, his condition will worsen. How badly, I can't say.\"\n\"How soon?\"\nHunter glanced toward her thumbnail chronometer.\n\"He's already past due, but there's a two to four hour grace period on the compound.\"\nReece nodded, \"There will be a meeting in the executive conference lounge in two hours. I want an account of inventory losses.\"\n\"Aye, sir.\"\nHunter about-faced as well as her wobbly legs would allow before the Commodore's words hit her.\n\"Inventory losses?\"\nThe medicine cabinets hung open, boxes of various drugs and chemicals scattered haphazardly on the floor. Feso pulled a chair out of the mess, offering her a place to sit down. She ignored the gesture, bending over to sort through the contents of some of the emptied boxes.\n\"What did they take?\"\n\"Haven't had time to check.\"\nShe sat down in the middle of the floor, starting to pick up and sort the miscellaneous bottles, jars, and canisters into tight, alphabetical rows.\n\"We'd better find out then, Feso. We've only got two hours.\"\nJohanes administered the injection with all the delicacy of a marsh slog in heat.\n\"Oops, missed the vein again.\"\n\"Ow... you sure you know you're doing?\"\n\"Don't worry.\"\nIf not for Cecil and his bottle of miruvor, Mike figured he'd be heading back to sickbay on account of his health.\n\"Told you you'd be out in no time.\"\nMike shrugged as Johanes withdrew the hypo, placing the empty plastic capsule in his pocket.\n\"You're certain about Sule.\"\n\"Positive.\"\n\"You saw her dead.\"\n\"To put it mildly.\"\n\"And what about the body?\"\nMike accepted a highbowl by way of congratulations, pausing before taking a sip.\n\"The body?\"\n\"Anything on it?\"\n\"I don't know. She was wearing a vacc suit.\"\nJohanes shot Cecil a worried glance as he caught the next highbowl, its course erratic as it teetered, languid, from side to side. Spokes received the next, and Cecil finally sent his own spinning on a collision course with the others until it clinked gently against each in consecutive sequence.\n\"To freedom.\"\n\"To freedom,\" everyone concurred, everyone except the Draconian.\n\"I don't want to disappoint you all, but we're not out of the asteroids yet. We have about enough time for one drink.\"\n\"Two drinks,\" Spokes took another sip and started reattaching his headgear.\n\"One drink. If they decide to conduct a ship-wide search, I'd like to know about it before it's too late.\"\n\"That would be uncouth.\"\n\"That never stopped ISIS before.\" Johanes gulped down the last of his drink like a man stranded in the desert. Then he smiled. \"I hereby conclude this celebration. Cecil, you stay here and monitor their communications. Michael, go to sleep. You've got six hours until the next injection.\"\n\"Terrific.\"\n\"Don't bitch. Spokes, you're with me.\"\n\"Okay, just a sec.\"\nMike poured himself another highbowl.\n\"Thanks. Everyone.\"\n\"Save your gratitude until we're dirtside. C'mon, we haven't got all millennium.\"\n\"Okay... jeeze.\"\nMike floated his half-drained highbowl toward the corner of the room as the door closed behind the dynamic if ill-disciplined duo. Cecil, meanwhile, leaned calmly beside his multi-wave radio, sipping miruvor and warming a left-over chili pita in the portable cooker. When it came out, the cheese oozed between the cracks in the flat-bread like a wad of snot leaking out the folds of an overused hanky.\n\"Want some?\"\nMike winced, \"I'll pass.\"\n\"Suit yourself.\"\n\"I'd rather stick to liquids for now.\"\n\"As in miruvor?\"\n\"Whatever's being served.\"\nCecil's single camera danced a bit, the cat taking notice and pouncing on it with claws outstretched, \"Your problem is you don't know when to quit.\"\n\"Untrue. I haven't gotten drunk for over a week... unless you count being force-fed by psychopaths.\"\n\"Well, congratulations,\" Cecil said, almost like he meant it.\n\"Give me a break, Cecil. I'm on my second highbowl which is nowhere near my face.\"\n\"Why the sudden fit of restraint?\"\nMike shrugged, \"Maybe seeing that old weasel Gardansa slurping it down...\" he grunted, crawling into the null-tube, \"I dunno. I was shot recently, okay?\"\n\"Good excuse as any.\"\n\"Besides, I want to keep clear-headed for a change. You check this place for bugs?\"\n\"You calling Cecil a fool?\"\nMike sighed, \"Just do me a favor. Check again.\"\nSetting the pita beside his multi-wave, Cecil dug a small box out of his suitcase. It's antenna telescoped out, and he proceeded to wave it around the room, switching off the light and then his multiwave as he scanned.\n\"Light on. You see. Nothing here but us chickens.\"\n\"Meow?\"\n\"What's it key on?\"\n\"Electrostatic emissions. Do us a favor and switch off the sleeper.\"\nMike complied, and Cecil waved the antenna over the null tube.\n\"Interesting,\" his friend commented, as though he'd found a strange insect on the bottom of his shoe.\n\"What? Something on the sleeper?\"\n\"No. On you.\"\nCecil poked him with the antenna a few times, finally stopping at the belt by which Mike's loose-fitting robe was held shut.\n\"Johanes find this for you?\"\nMike untangled it from around his waist, inspecting the stiff fabric until he found what he was looking for. The bug was flat and circular, like one of those old coins he used to find in the barrens, only a little thicker and without a stately, bearded profile on the side.\n\"One down.\"\nCecil kept looking, this time even more diligently than before, but the one was all they found. Cecil finally cracked it open.\n\"It's just a recorder. Looks like cheap crystal.\"\nHe put it back together and dropped it into the portable heater.\n\"Cheap crystal fries easy.\"\nMike smiled, \"Now that we're alone, you can start by telling me everything.\"\nCecil sat down, his camera taking a thoughtful, sidelong pose as it dumped Pooper-dumper back to the carpet in a fitful of snarls and hairballs.\n\"Not much to tell.\"\n\"Humor me.\"\nCecil sighed, leaning himself backward until the multiwave became a makeshift pillow.\n\"Spokes showed up at the Sintrivani after you left, and we heard about the air strike over the three-vee. Assumed you were somehow involved, knowing your aptitude for mischief.\"\n\"I'm flattered.\"\n\"You should be. One of the offworlders waiting for transport must have sneaked near the landing platform with a camera, because next thing we see is Tizar's favorite gatherer hanging out the airlock of an orbit-bound vessel. Then some explosions in the sky. Made for an amusing show.\"\n\"I was on three-vee?\"\n\"More or less. The back of your head was, at least. We knew who it was. Johanes dropped by a few hours later and basically confirmed what we saw.\"\n\"And so you guys decided to rescue me... just for kicks.\"\nCecil thought about it before answering, as though he was deciding whether to be polite or honest.\n\"Johanes gave you less than even odds against Sule. He wanted our help to finish her off.\"\n\"Assassination. This is getting even better.\"\n\"One might remind you that you're hardly virginal, Michael.\"\n\"I wasn't in it for money.\"\n\"Neither was I!\"\nCecil spat the words out, pronoun included, pausing briefly to regain his composure. The cat darted to the corner of the room, certain a voice of that volume could only be directed at four- legged personages.\n\"We agreed to aid him in what he wanted, provided that he aid us in what we wanted.\"\n\"Which was?\"\n\"Your rescue, given the unlikelihood that you would still be kicking after a confrontation with Sule.\"\nMike smiled meekly, a little embarrassed.\n\"That's it?\"\nThe camera nodded, \"In verbose totality.\"\n\"If it was just you, I'd buy it. Why's Spokes here?\"\n\"Like Cecil said before, he seems to like you. We chipheads stick together.\"\nMike smirked, \"That's pretty weak.\"\n\"Then call Cecil a liar. It won't be a first.\"\n\"What are you giving him? Free wedgies?\"\nCecil chomped another bite from his cheese pita as he pondered the question. In the hackers lingo \"free wedgies\" equated to a gratis apprenticeship, master to novice, wizard to user, or between any other combination of disparate proficiencies: in short, Cecil to just about anyone. Before, Spokes was just the aspiring pupil. But now, given the risks involved, he was encroaching to the point of earning his keep, making the so- called \"wedgies\" not entirely free.\n\"What's it to you, Michael?\"\n\"Well... I guess I'm just curious how this all came about. I've never known you to team-up with people, much less take on a long-term student.\"\n\"Life brings newness.\"\n\"Is that what you told Spokes?\"\n\"Not precisely.\"\nMike laughed, then coughed.\n\"Try me.\"\n\"Get some RL.\" Real life, he meant.\n\"C'mon Cecil. Just the main points. You can spare the slogshit.\"\nCecil smirked, \"Courage as an aspect of knowledge. Necessity of the will to seek. Proof of intents...\"\n\"You waste my time, I waste yours?\"\n\"Stop whining. It got you out, didn't it?\"\nMike shrugged defensively, \"I'm not whining. I don't really care that you're using him. It's merely a transaction as far as he's concerned. I just wanted to know here everyone stands. For some reason,\" Mike tried to laugh, \"I just couldn't picture you three guys coming all the way out here. You maybe. I mean, now we're more or less even again. Right?\"\n\"More or less.\"\n\"But Johanes and Spokes... I thought I was dreaming.\"\n\"Maybe you are.\"\n\"No... I've got other dreams. I guess we both do.\"\nCecil was silent for a bit after that, finishing the pita and sucking down the last of his miruvor. Maybe he didn't know what to say. Mike tried closing his eyes, but sleep wouldn't come.\n\"Y'think we're gonna get out of here, Cecil?\"\nHe didn't answer. Mike wondered if he'd even heard the question. With eyes glossed over, Cecil was already in the other world.\n\"See `em? Self-replication detected. Zoom.\"\nChief Tuto looked from one monitor window to the other, his brown eyes narrowing on the detection pings as they appeared, divided, and vanished in short order. It was just as before, only quicker, as if they knew they'd been spotted.\n\"Where are they coming from?\"\nDira shrugged, a tangle of amber hair falling over one eye.\n\"Tracer says medical, but look at the entry log.\"\n\"Could be stealthing. Run a CPU verify.\"\nOne hand danced over the keyboard, \"Yeah... no... well, something was there. A difference of two percent detected for about... half a second.\"\n\"Run a full heads on exit channels, quick.\"\nIt was a waste of time, of course, and by the time they got around to checking out the entry logs, there were no entry logs. Tuto studied the blank screen with an equally blank expression, finally releasing an irritated grunt.\n\"This is getting rude.\"\n\"Maybe not.\"\nHer hand did another dance. \"Port 129 shows simultaneous closure.\"\nTuto glanced toward the wall-chart. 129 was one of the public aether ports. It could be accessed via wireless terminal, open to virtually any person on board.\n\"Entry logs?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"He's not taking chances. And he's too fast to lock in place.\" He chewed on the thought. Speed usually bred sloppiness. \"Do a frequency comparison on the ports.\"\nDira tapped a few more keys, her dark blue eyes scanning the row of frequencies as they scrolled off the monitor window. \"Got it. Here's the band they were using, and here it's being used on Port 182. Same exact frequency.\"\nTuto nodded, not terribly surprised bytheir trespasser's lack of precautions. Too bad. The game had just started getting interesting.\n\"Feed in a command stop. We'll lock him in place and check the entry logs.\"\nHer fingers complied, and the keyboard locked up as though somebody had yanked it off the desk.\n\"Huh?\"\nTuto went to another console. Same story. He slammed a fist on the keyboard in frustration. Dira put a hand on his shoulder.\n\"That won't help.\"\n\"It makes me feel better.\"\n\"Look at the port display.\"\nOne-eight-two flashed all the way from the command console to the security desk, as cruel a set-up as he'd ever witnessed. Dira seemed to smile at their predicament.\n\"We got re-routed, sir.\"\nTuto pushed the air from his lungs and began pacing around the room, re-booting each of the consoles in turn. It would be several minutes before they were back online, and somebody out there was making the most of the time, probably laughing hysterically.\n\"This is getting very rude.\"\nIt felt a little like free-ditching off the Aerial Palace, the rush of adrenalin and anxiety clawing at the will's outer shell. He could break a sweat just thinking about it, because every time the possibility of fate catching up was both real and expected. They had a place called \"Gyron's Fall,\" named after some poor sap whose grav-restrainer failed. Not his fault. It just suddenly decided to up and quit in mid-air. Became the biggest joke halfway across the Realm. Gyron ended up bouncing, and they dug a little crater and buried him head-first, his feet sticking up with a pair of boots that had foggers in their soles, such was the Draconian sense of humor. Johanes remembered laughing out loud at the time, wishing he could have been there.\n\"It's locked.\"\nSpokes waved his hands in an apparently arcane gesture as the door slid open. Johanes regarded his triumphant expression with all the amusement it deserved.\n\"We're on a schedule here, okay?\"\n\"Sorry.\"\nSpokes followed him inside with a casual waltz, a sharp contrast to his crisp-collared maintenance uniform. That was okay. It made him look like he knew what he was doing. Johanes paced about the room, flipping a power screwdriver end over end.\n\"There are fire sprinklers in here.\"\n\"So there are.\"\n\"Here, hold this.\"\nThe chiphead still regarded the canister with a mixture of curiosity and ambivalence. All he knew was that it held clear liquid sandwiched between white powder and a fan, each separated by a sheet of impacted polymer with radio-controlled shutters. Enough information for the average ten-year-old, Johanes figured, opening a vent.\n\"There's a sensor in here also.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"Tell Cecil we'll need to deactivate it just before this is triggered. All of them. This has to work perfectly or we all get caught. Understand?\"\n\"I still don't know what you're talking about.\"\nJohanes bit his tongue. Spokes knew, all right. He just didn't want to admit it, the perfect conspirator, hedging all bets by feigning ignorance.\n\"Relay the message. Can you do that much?\"\nThe tall one sighed and finally nodded, soft blue eyes seeing no ready alternative.\n\"First of all, we're going to find the escapee. There are no alternatives. There will be no excuses for failure.\"\nReece stared around the chamber, slowly taking in all their expressions. Every officer in the room knew that organizing a ship-wide search on a ship the size of the Crimson Queen was no mean task. The deadline only increased the challenge.\n\"As you all know, we'll be dropping back into normal space in about nine hours. The traffic situation at Tyber will be enough of a problem without a fugitive to worry about, so it would seem that time is of the essence. Keep that fact in mind while you make your reports. Captain?\"\nDunham leaned forward, nodding to the Commodore as his broad mass shifted. With the press of a button, Mike's image materialized over the conference table in three dimensions.\n\"This is the man we're looking for. Pictures have already been distributed to the crew, several of whom have noticed a likeness with this man.\"\nHe pressed the button again, and the jacks were replaced by an unkept mane of long brown hair.\n\"His real name is Michael Harrison. He's a gatherer with the Tizarian division of Galactic Press. We believe he has two allies on board. They used hypo guns with a short-duration sedative in order to incapacitate the guard stationed at the cage. They also tranquilized Dr. Hunter and two specialists.\"\nReece interrupted, \"Has the hypo compound been identified?\"\nHunter nodded, \"Senthinol-3. It's a consumer product made at a number of systems in this sector. Been in circulation for the past three centuries.\"\nThe Captain looked around slowly, drawing presence from the silence before continuing.\n\"Harrison is wanted for homicide on Calanna. He is also suspected of impersonating an ISIS operative in order to get aboard, a felony under interstellar law.\"\n\"He's wanted for homicide?\"\nDunham nodded, \"Apparently, but we don't have any details.\"\nIt made sense. The Calannans were generally private about such things. But that didn't explain why he wasn't caught.\n\"They must have sent us his image recognition code.\"\n\"Yes, but because of the unusual way he attained passage, he was never checked out.\"\nReece bit her lip.\n\"Any idea on how his associates got the cell combination?\"\n\"We have a theory. Security ran a level two diagnostic of the ship's computer after the break-in. They found a number of recon---worms. We've been attempting to trace their source, but so far, no luck.\"\n\"You're saying they broke into the system and just read the combination?\"\n\"So it would seem.\"\nReece bit her lip again.\n\"Those combinations are well protected. Why wasn't an alarm activated?\"\n\"We don't know.\"\n\"How are they avoiding our trace?\"\nDunham turned toward a petty officer at his right. \"Chief Tuto?\"\n\"They're using a variety of means. Stealth, entry-log erasures, misdirection tactics. They've also found out how to slip into unused frequencies unobserved.\"\n\"I thought all unused frequencies were observed continuously.\"\n\"They've managed to draw out our observation routines and are sending data packets between the check points. We also believe they're using above-board frequencies for voice transmissions.\"\n\"Have you conferred with communications about this?\"\n\"Actually sir, they were already aware of it.\" He nodded across the table to another officer. Tabor shifted in his seat, realizing he was suddenly on-stage.\n\"Uh... six hours ago...\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"Tabor. Ensign. First Class. Communications Officer, sir.\"\nHe looked raw, like a typical navy recruit, the coppery-orange hair cropped so close to his head that his appearance reminded her of a turnip. She guessed that his problem had more to do with nerves than hair. He seemed so scared it made her jitter just to look at him.\n\"Go ahead, Ensign.\"\n\"Six hours ago, one of our engineers noticed some very interesting readings from an instrument which measures fractures in the normal-space bubble around the ship. The device operates by bouncing a short-wave signal along the bubble's area perimeter.\"\n\"Excuse me, Ensign,\" Reece waved from the other side of the table. \"Is this going to take a while to explain? We don't have time for a lecture in astrophysics.\"\n\"Umm... I'll be brief, sir.\"\n\"Very brief.\"\n\"Yes sir. The gist of it is that this radio frequency is being used continuously while we are in hyperspace, but to someone unfamiliar with engineering, it looks like normal line noise between usable bands, thus qualifying it for exploitation by a tight frequency transmission.\"\n\"You're telling me that they're using a voice frequency which is already in use?\"\n\"Anyone sufficiently skilled in communications can compress transmissions into data packets, fire each one off several times, then decompress the packets, check for inconsistencies caused by the line noise, correct, and presto; they're using a frequency which also happens to be in use by a non-sentient system, and their transmission goes through entirely undetected. But in this case, it didn't.\"\n\"I think you just confused me more. Try the gist again.\"\nTabor took a deep breath, \"Okay. Prior to jump, they must have been looking for an above-board frequency with residual noise. Something that wasn't being used, but that had enough random noise on it that it wouldn't be scanned like a clean frequency where their transmission would be picked up in an instant. This frequency qualified perfectly. The computer was running tests on it by generating random noise, transmitting it externally to the sensor, and making comparisons to see whether or not the sensor was operating within its safety parameters.\"\n\"So you're saying this particular band was ideal for their purposes?\"\n\"Very much so. If this had been an older craft where the comm system isn't as tight and clean as it is on this ship, they would have had a lot more to choose from, but on this vessel we don't really have any junkie above-board frequencies, so their choice was very limited.\"\n\"And our engineers caught them when their transmissions interfered with the operation of the sensors.\"\n\"Correct.\"\nReece nodded, \"I understand, but why wasn't this reported immediately?\"\nTabor took a deep breath, \"I didn't learn about it until I came on shift about three hours ago, and at that point I didn't believe it. By the time the second transmission rolled around, I was convinced, but...\"\n\"There were two?\"\n\"Three, sir. The first six hours ago which lasted for a minute or two. The second, a little over two and a half hours ago, which lasted only few seconds. And the third began a little over two hours ago and has been continuous since then.\"\nReece bit her lip yet again, this time hard enough to make her reconsider the action.\n\"Let me get this straight. Harrison has been using a restricted frequency for the past six hours, the past two hours continuously, and this is the first I hear of it?\"\n\"Sir, we didn't even know what we were dealing with until news of the prisoner escape started to circulate. For all we knew, it was some sort of localized hyperspace phenomenon or even a prank.\"\n\"A prank?\"\n\"Yes sir.\"\nReece regarded Dunham with a sinister stare, and the Captain's dark cheeks grew rosy under her scrutiny.\n\"Well, it's a relief that the crew has grown proficient at entertaining themselves. We wouldn't want morale to suffer. Ensign, can we pinpoint the signal source?\"\n\"Not with the equipment on board.\"\n\"Can you at least tell us what it's saying?\"\n\"The instrument's readings are used and removed from computer memory in a continuous cycle, so we lost the first transmission entirely. That's gone forever. The second one lasted only for a few seconds, and I've already tried around a thousand standard decryption routines, none of which has worked. I wouldn't put too much hope on us ever deciphering its contents, at least not any time soon, and certainly not without very powerful computer support. The current transmission is still being saved, but I expect that we'll find the same problem we're having with the second.\"\nReece took a deep breath, \"So in other words, no.\"\nTabor just sat there looking pale.\n\"In the future, Ensign, when I ask you a question, don't give me a speech. A yes or no will suffice.\"\n\"Aye, sir.\"\n\"Can you jam the frequency?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Do it. Immediately. You're dismissed.\"\n\"Aye, sir.\"\nHe saluted and exited.\n\"Chief Tuto, I want all passenger access to the computer stopped and aether port access restricted to pre-verified frequencies. You're dismissed.\"\n\"Aye, sir.\"\nReece waited for him to leave as she studied the stony expression on Dunham's face. He seemed to be waiting for some comment, or perhaps a pat on the head. She might have obliged him had she a sturdy club.\n\"Pranks?\"\n\"They do happen, sir.\"\n\"We could have spotted this hacker hours in advance if there hadn't been such leniency. Now that they've had hours to feel out our system...\"\n\"It makes them all the more dangerous,\" he took the luxury of completing her thought.\n\"I want one of your people to run through the passenger lists and see who looks like they might qualify. Unless those have already been erased.\"\n\"Will do, sir.\"\n\"Also, see if any of the passengers are mentioned in our library records as being associated with this Mr. Harrison.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nReece leaned back, seemingly examining the ceiling.\n\"I'd like to order a re-boot as well.\"\nDunham smiled, \"Not a good idea, sir.\"\n\"No, not while we're in hyperspace,\" the Commodore reluctantly agreed. \"Lieutenant.\"\nErik snapped to attention, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Give me a scenario.\"\nHe took a breath, \"Gatherer in search of a story. He learns more than is wise; breaks some planetary laws. He decides to turn tail but gets cornered at the starport. He calls us, pretends that he's an ISIS agent, and we obligingly offer him a ride. His friends figure out what happened easily enough. They rescue him.\"\n\"A great deal of risk on their part. And what about Erestyl? What about the information we so ardently desire?\"\nErik bit his lip. \"More than likely it is gone, blown to bits by Clay. Perhaps he wasn't lying except about his own role.\"\n\"If he is simply a gatherer, then how did he happen upon Draconian fleximesh?\"\n\"Bought it at a Calannic yard sale?\"\n\"Right,\" Reece smiled, then frowned again, looking back across the table at nobody in particular. \"It seems to me this whole thing reeks of the DSS, and who more willing to take such a risk, provided the pay-off is right? Which would suggest that Harrison is important to them alive. All the more reason for us to take him alive. Commander Simms?\"\n\"Sir.\"\nHe had broad-shoulders and a square jaw, the sort that made her wonder if he spent his free time doing push-ups in three-gee while chewing down carrots and ironweed.\n\"Are we prepared for a top to bottom?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Word to the troops?\"\n\"Shoot to maim, sir.\"\n\"I don't want him dead.\"\n\"Aye, sir.\"\nShe began to wonder if there was a half a brain in there. Then she noticed the look on Hunter's face, half way between fear and urgency.\n\"Doctor, you look like you have something itching up your backside.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Spit it out.\"\n\"Well, first of all, I think this Mr. Harrison is in trouble... to put things mildly, sir.\"\nThe Commodore's eyebrows arched playfully.\n\"Enlighten me.\"\n\"We found several vials of Torogon-66 missing from our stores. It's a wide-spectrum regen-formula common to the outer worlds. We've kept it in stock for patients who are unsuited or prove allergic to the in-house compound.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"The Torogon formula is never injected directly following use of our in-house compound without an intervening stabilizer and a twelve hour waiting period. If this isn't done, the interaction of the formula and our compound will cause a high-potential for misreads of the patient's DNA.\"\n\"What, he mutates?\" said with a smirk.\n\"I doubt he'll live long enough for that. It'll begin by wiping out the delicate systems, two critical ones being the immune and nervous systems. He'll lose control of his lungs in a day or two, and he'll have to invent a new way of fending off opportunistic viruses sooner than that.\"\n\"Did they take any stabilizers?\"\n\"I haven't found any missing.\"\nReece nodded, \"We can only assume that our thieves are pharmaceutically inept. They have probably already injected him. Is there any treatment?\"\n\"Yes, there's a compound called Anamesa.\"\n\"Go on.\"\n\"It'll stop the interaction between the regens and boost the immune system so the body has time to restore itself, but if it isn't applied within the first six to twelve hours, you can forget it. It'll be too late to do anything without extensive medical resources, much greater than we have onboard.\"\nDunham sat upright, \"How soon until he gets sick?\"\n\"Like I said, it varies, though usually by the time the patient is seriously ill, it's too late to apply the Anamesa. You can still artificially boost their immunity to specific diseases, however, the damage to their system, per se, is already there.\"\n\"And restoring it is not easy.\"\nHunter shook her head, \"Some might say impossible.\"\nThe Commodore grinned from ear to ear, \"I hate to be celebrating another person's misfortune, but all in all, that's excellent news. I want our supply of Anamesa destroyed, and I want our mind-scanner readied for use.\"\n\"Sir?\"\n\"You have moral reservations, Doctor?\"\nHunter averted her eyes. \"Sir, we have never used the mind-scanner.\"\n\"You don't have trained staff?\"\n\"No, it's not that. I just... it's over ten years old. I don't even know if it'll work. And as for destroying the Anamesa, if you do capture this Mr. Harrison, that may be the only thing you have to bargain with.\"\n\"Oh, don't worry Doctor. We'll capture him. I just have no intentions of serving him the opportunity to live, and besides, this way it isn't anyone's fault.\" She smiled, then frowned.\n\"What is it, Doctor?\"\n\"They took more than the Torogon-66.\"\n\"Such as?\"\n\"Hydrochloric acid and potassium cyanide.\"\n\"Enough to pose a threat?\"\n\"Not to the entire ship, but to a small section, yes. I would like poison filters circulated to the crew and passengers.\"\nReece shook her head, \"We don't have enough except for the senior officers. I wouldn't worry about it too much Doctor. It's a lame threat. He's asking us what its worth to catch him. The answer is yes... it's worth a few lives.\"\n\"I am prepared to declare quarantine.\"\n\"That won't be necessary.\" Reece shrugged. \"They probably won't use it. They would have nothing to gain and everything to lose. I could see them smuggling it to Tyber, but...\"\n\"And that sits well with you?\"\n\"The Tyber Corporation is just barely Imperial aligned as it is. We owe them no favors.\"\n\"Sir, the Tyberian population is extremely impacted. In such an environment...\"\n\"I know, Doctor. Look, cyanide gas is easy to make; its components are easy to come by. Nobody will trace it to us, and even if they do, we can simply deny involvement.\"\n\"Commodore...\"\n\"Don't argue with me, Doctor. There's more at stake than you may realize.\"\n\"Sir... with all due respect, human life is at stake.\"\nReece felt her cheeks flush red with anger. What did she think this was? A playground?!\n\"Doctor, I can see that you've been under a great deal of stress lately. I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I'm relieving you of your post until we leave the Tyber system. I want to you get some rest, and under no circumstances are you permitted to discuss any of this with anyone. Understood?\"\n\"You're relieving me of duty?\"\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\"Sir...\"\n\"Don't argue with me, Doctor. I'm made up my mind. Now go to your quarters and get some rest.\"\n\"But sir...\"\n\"That's an order.\"\nHunter took a deep breath. \"Yes, sir.\"\nThe bridge seemed imersed in slumber as Tabor exited the lift. The reason was fairly apparent. Most of the officers took their sleep shift during the ship's final hours in hyperspace. It was a common practice. Everyone wanted to wake up and be ready for sightseeing. That was the real attraction to working on board a liner.\nOf course, somebody had to stick around. The Captain didn't want people calling the bridge to end up talking to a computer. It would leave a bad impression, and people would start wondering if anybody was ever up there in the proverbial nerve center. It was such a joke. The computer was in charge while in hyperspace, and everyone knew it. They just refused to accept it.\nSo while everyone else was dozing, he and Lish often had the whole place to themselves. A communications officer had to be there. Communication still went on, hyperspace or normal space, it didn't matter. But she was a sensor operator. She could go to sleep, though she seemed to prefer the solitude, fiddling with the equipment during the wee hours, programming new image recognition routines, skimming library files, and generally being a nuisance or a quiet companion as the mood suited her.\n\"How'd it go?\"\n\"Oh... not so well.\"\nShe grinned, turning back to her work station.\n\"Lots of questions?\"\n\"Yeah. A few too many. Oh, terrific. What are they doing now?\"\nShe turned around again.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"These bastards. I don't believe this. Just when I'm about to jam their frequency...\"\nLish studied the monitor from over his shoulder, \"Why is everything blinking?\"\n\"They using the clean bands, must be switching continuously. They're not even trying to disguise it anymore.\"\nHe hit a switch, listening for the familiar pop signaling a channel opening.\n\"Bernie?\"\n\"Huh? Oh, hi.\"\n\"Bernie, have you been watching the free lanes lately?\"\n\"Yeah. Did you just freak the system? I think it's space sick.\"\n\"It's working fine. Look, I'm gonna need you to hook up our wide-band transmitter.\"\n\"The shouter?\"\n\"Yeah. We need to jam all the free lanes.\"\n\"All of `em? What's up?\"\n\"Freeloaders.\"\n\"Ah... so we've got a little war on our hands, do we? Just gimme a minute or two to get it online, and we'll have `em sending smoke signals.\"\n\"Okay, open sesame.\"\nThe door complied, and Johanes peeked inside, spraying a canister of air-freshener from ceiling to floor. The Lieutenant's cabin was decked out more nicely that he probably deserved. Queen-sized null tube, a full length wall monitor, and the sort of fluffy red carpet that suggested Imperial royalty.\n\"Hmmm... cozy. A trifle insecure but very cozy.\"\n\"Don't you think you're over-doing it?\"\nJohanes turned around, \"One can never over-do it.\"\n*Beep*\n\"Attention all personnel and passengers. By order of the Commodore, all radio frequencies are to be restricted for the remainder of this voyage. Obtain clearance for all vital transmissions through channel two. This order takes effect in one minute.\"\nJohanes breathed a sigh of relief, \"Important corollary. One may always count on the enemy to over-do it. Contact Cecil for me. Tell him that's his cue. Also have him jam channels one and two.\"\nSpokes leaned against the wall, his long, lanky arms dropping to his sides, head tricks gleaming in the steady, white light as he seemed to concentrate on nothing in particular. Then in a hollow voice, \"He says we have to get something for Mike.\"\n\"What now?!\"\n\"Anamesa. Difference between life and death.\"\n\"This is getting tiresome.\"\n\"It's in sickbay.\"\n\"Later. Tell him we're busy.\"\n\"Now or no deal.\"\nJohanes grunted and kicked the wall, \"We don't have time to discuss it.\"\n\"He says this is a dead end. It was never mentioned. They don't seem to know it exists. What's he talking about, Jo?\"\n\"They must!\"\n\"He says it probably got trashed in the air strike. Or they left it on the Louise.\"\n\"I don't believe this. Look, just tell him to activate the canister or it'll be too late. We'll get this Anamesa now. Tell him... ummm... tell him to change the computer records on it... make it a lust-potion... but he has to activate the canister now.\"\nSpokes shook his head, \"Everything's jammed. He was saying okay, but I don't know if he had time.\"\nJohanes smirked, \"If he said yes... he had time.\"\n\"...and at that point, Harrison's only alternative will be to turn himself in. We'll have a mind-scanner readied for when he arrives at sickb... what's that sm...\"\nThe odor was overpowering, like a strong whiff of almond extract. She'd breathed several gulps before the bubbling noise and the gentle hum of the fan even registered, and then her head throbbed as though a vice were pushing on both sides. When she looked back up, Dunham was busying himself by body-slamming the door. His heavy mass finally crumpled to the ground, limbs still thrashing spastically as gunfire ricocheted against its metal frame and into the locking mechanism. Simms was already at the IC, hitting his fist against the audio pick-up and switching channels wildly. Presently, the room began swirling, and she felt herself drop from the chair, her communicator miraculously in one hand. She switched it to channel one.\n\"Anybody...\" Static.\n\"Help...\" Channel two. More static.\n\"Need help...\"\nHunter didn't know which peeved her more, getting force-fed an unsolicited sedative or being relieved from duty, by the Commodore herself, no less. The perverse politics they were playing was only upstaged by their thoughtless endangerment of human life. Hunter shook her head, disgusted with the whole mess. At least there was a bright side. She was no longer responsible. Whatever happened would be on their heads, and as soon as she was back in bed, this awful day would be over.\nShe let a yawn escape as she glanced at her thumbnail chronometer, ignoring the minor sparks of pain her bruised nose loved so much to scream about. It was already the middle of her sleep shift, and her body was aching from a recent workout which bordered somewhere between spirited and raging. Sickbay was just around the corner. She decided she could stay up for a few more minutes, squinting her eyes shut as another yawn muscled its way down her throat. After all, what more could happen in a few lousy minutes?\nBoxes were everywhere, reds, blues, yellows, all falling in different directions, their long, curly ribbons waving gleefully from the impact. She picked herself slowly off the floor, looking amidst all the colorful, geometric shapes as a red, sticky liquid dripped to the white, hexagonal tile. The culprit's head tricks had to take the prize for conspicuousness. They rose from his head like long, thin, needles, clearly illegal on many worlds not only for their self-destructive properties but also for their ability to skewer innocent bystanders should he suddenly flip-out and go on a bloody, head-butting rampage. He looked up slowly, the soft blue eyes strangely familiar as she helped his long, lanky body back to its feet.\n\"I'm terribly sorry.\" She mouthed the words, obedient to the ship's policy code. It was his fault, of course, but he was just another stupid passenger, oblivious to the world around him. She felt like telling him that in so many words, but his blue eyes and gentle hands, still shaky from the impact, helped stay her tongue.\n\"No,\" he smiled as she helped him up. \"It was my fault. Are you okay?\" Then he dropped his look of shame. \"Alice?!\"\nHunter nodded, wiping the blood from her nose with the back of her sleeve.\n\"Do I know you?\"\n\"What, you don't remember me?\"\n\"Umm...\"\n\"IASM, class of `43.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I don't...\"\n\"Hanson's microbiotics.\"\n\"Umm,\" she stared back into his eyes, soft blue pinwheels coasting vaguely in her head. \"I'm sorry, what's your name?\"\n\"Well well... if it isn't Mr. Smyth.\"\nJohanes grinned shyly as he walked into sickbay. Feso was with a patient, one of the food service workers probably. The crew had their uniforms color coded according to section, the only problem with the system being that there didn't seem to be enough distinguishable colors to go around. Feso, of course, had found the perfect solution.\n\"You always wear your pajamas to work?\"\nFeso laughed, \"I've been getting comments on this all day. No, we had a little bit of a... how shall one put it...\"\n\"A busy morning?\"\n\"Very busy.\"\nThe patient looked very frigid, but whatever Feso had given him seemed to be warming the blood. Johanes followed the nurse back the main desk, looking over his shoulder as they passed the office. Several boxes were still scattered about.\n\"What's with the mess?\"\n\"Ah... just been taking inventory.\"\n\"I love your system.\"\n\"Yeah. Well, we're sort of disorganized at the moment. So what can I do for you? That drug been giving you a bad aftertaste?\"\n\"I just wanted to say thanks. I don't know what would have happened to me if you hadn't been here.\"\n\"Awww...\" Feso grinned, \"you just got to beware Calannans bearing gifts. Oh... what's this?\"\n\"A tip. \"\n\"Five hundred credits? I didn't know they printed denominations this high. This is very nice of you, but I couldn't.\"\n\"Please. I made a mess. I feel bad. Please take it.\" He looked like he was on the verge of being mortally wounded.\n\"Okay. You twist my arm, how can I refuse?\" Feso pocketed the waxy bill with a grin. \"This is a very big tip. You sure that drug isn't affecting your brain or something?\"\nJohanes laughed, \"I think that's what she had in mind.\"\n\"She?\"\n\"The woman who spiked my punch. Actually, she's part of the reason I'm dropping by.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"I didn't really know who else to ask, but I need something.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Anamesa. Just a few grams.\"\n\"Anamesa? I've heard of that somewhere.\"\n\"Can you... you know...\" Johanes motioned his glance toward the boxes in the office.\nFeso shook his head, \"Not a chance. I don't even think you can get Anamesa without a prescription. What's she need it for? Isn't it some sort of immunity enhancer?\"\nJohanes laughed, \"You call yourself a nurse.\"\n\"What? It is, isn't it?\"\nJohanes leaned over the counter, lowering his voice to a bare whisper. \"It's an aphrodisiac.\"\n\"No...\"\n\"Would I lie?\"\nFeso turned to the medical console, bringing up a description from computer records. He blinked at least twice when he saw the classification. Johanes just smiled.\n\"See. What'd I tell you?\"\n\"Wow. Learn something new every day.\"\n\"So can you?\"\nFeso looked back towards the boxes. The A's were long since reorganized. Finding it would be a snap. Still, he didn't like the idea.\n\"You know, it says it's non-restricted. You can probably get it from the pharmacy.\"\n\"Already tried. They're out. I guess a lot of people have been partying.\"\nFeso smiled, \"Guess so. Wait... what's this for? You're not thinking of getting that Calannan back, are you?\"\n\"Hey, she drugged me. She said I could drug her back.\"\nHe laughed, \"That's immoral.\"\n\"I'm going to propose.\"\n\"Then it's extremely immoral.\"\n\"Please?\"\nFeso smiled, \"Just because I'm wearing pajamas doesn't mean I'm a push-over.\"\n\"Look... the proposal is sincere. We've been talking about marriage for the past five years.\"\n\"Five years?\"\nJohanes nodded, making his best honest face. Feso pondered the request for a moment. The Captain always did say to bend over backwards for the passengers.\n\"I never did this for you. Okay?\"\n\"Thanks. I knew I could count on you.\"\n\"Yeah yeah... sheesh.\"\nFeso watched him leave, trophy in fist, and not a moment too soon. Hunter came through the door two seconds later, holding her nose and looking mildly irate.\n\"Wasn't that our resident stoner?\"\n\"Naw... you mean Mr. Smyth?\"\n\"Yeah. What are you so happy about? He give you a roach to go with the jammies?\"\nFeso smiled, \"I take it the meeting didn't go as well as planned.\"\n\"It was horrible.\"\n\"What's wrong with your nose? The Commodore smack you one?\"\n\"In a manner of speaking. She relieved me of duty.\"\nFeso's jaw dropped, \"Why?\"\n\"Various reasons.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nShe forced a smirk. Feso had long since learned when to keep his mouth shut, even when it looked like his boss was defying a direct order.\n\"I'm just getting a bandage, Feso.\"\n\"I didn't ask.\"\nThe infirmary had all the good ones, not like the flimsy retail bandages that held just long enough to soak through with blood. She taped one under her nose, giving herself the little- moustache look. It suited her, Feso decided, going back to check on the food service worker who still sat wrapped in a warm blanket, a layer of frost melting along his eyebrows. Hunter came in, maybe to ask a question or give an order. He could never tell which was coming. Then she looked at Mr. Frosty, whatever was on her mind apparently stolen by the spectacle.\n\"What happened to you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Anyone tell you that you resemble an ice cube?\"\nThe man looked up, a slow sort of smile crossing his face.\n\"Accidentally locked myself in a meat locker.\"\n\"How come?\"\n\"Just happened.\"\nHunter smiled, heading back to the office with her nurse in tow. Feso felt somewhat confused.\n\"What now?\"\n\"I thought that since I'm dishonorably relieved, you'd like to know that you're hereby conferred the honorable title of boss until I'm back on the job.\"\n\"Me? What about Dr. Pendelton?\"\n\"He's a techie, Feso. He doesn't know anything about running the shop. You do. Besides, you know how he is when he gets a gram of power.\"\n\"Yeah. He likes to take charge.\"\n\"He'll be in charge... of the mind scanner.\"\n\"Mind scanner?\"\n\"Better not to ask questions.\"\n\"Yeah, but I don't think he'll like...\"\nBeep\n\"Attention all personnel and passengers. By order of the Commodore, public access to the computer is disallowed until we reach Tizar. Requests for waivers must be made in person at the computer security center on Deck Four.\"\nThe line popped shut, and Feso shot her an incredulous look, \"Jeeze... this is getting ridiculous. First the comm-system. Now the computers. What's going on?\"\n\"Politics. Go get Pendelton and tell him we need the scanner.\"\nShe went to the office and shuffled through the stacks until she found the carton of Anamesa. The tiny, yellow bottles were the size of her thumb, and one by one, she opened them over the sink, washing their syrupy contents down the drain. Her joints felt grainy and brittle, her skin growing increasingly coarse with every new bottle. As she reached in for the last one, her fingers met only vacant air. Feso was coming back in, a dismayed expression now transforming to the epitome of innocence.\n\"Feso, I'm not sure, but I think we're missing a bottle here.\"\n\"A bottle?\"\n\"Yeah, of the Anamesa. When I counted them this morning, I'm sure there were six. There are only five here.\"\n\"Ah... that's interesting. What do you want with Anamesa?\"\n\"I'm trying to get rid of it.\"\nShe tapped a few keys on the medical console, and the database's query prompt popped into view at the bottom of the screen. For a moment, Feso's blood froze cold. Hunter finally looked up at him, her eyes sullen and tired.\n\"I guess I was mistaken. It says five.\"\n\"It does?\"\n\"Feso... is something the matter?\"\n\"Yes... I mean no... I'm fine. What's all the concern with Anamesa. People getting too horny or something?\"\n\"What?\"\nFeso gulped, \"Why was the Captain ordering you to destroy an aphrodisiac?\"\nShe laughed, \"Anamesa is not an aphrodisiac. Where'd you get that idea?\"\n\"I thought it was.\"\n\"Well, it's not.\"\nFeso looked her over like she was crazy, and she imagined she was staring back the same way.\n\"You don't believe me?\"\nFeso shrugged, \"With all due respect, sir, I just happen to know for a fact that you're wrong.\"\n\"You do, do you?\"\n\"Yes. I'll put five-hundred on it right now.\"\n\"You're on.\"\nHe hit a few keys on the medical console, staring dumbfounded at the screen when he saw the result. Hunter regarded him with a cheerful smirk.\n\"Pay up, buddy.\"\nHe figured that either he was going nuts or he was being toyed with, and luckily, the latter was the more likely of the two.\n\"This is a prank, right? You and Mr. Smyth. Very clever. Okay, here you are.\" He didn't care. He was tired and just as rich as when the whole thing started.\n\"What's this about Mr. Smyth?\"\n\"Oh... nothing I'm sure the two of you can't figure out. Tell him thanks for the tip when you see him. It provided me with so much joy and happiness.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I'm going to sleep. It's the middle of my sleep shift.\"\n\"Feso, what's the matter?\"\nBut he was gone, leaving her alone with a half-frozen patient in the other room. Two security guards emerged at the entry portal a minute later, both puffing anxiously.\n\"Dr. Hunter?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Need you at the EC-lounge.

Mike laid still along the water's edge, his bare feet slowly dipping in and out of the quiet tide. An empty flask rested at arm's length from his tired body as he dreamt about years past and worlds far across the vast sea of space.\nHe remembered a gentle Sirian voice warning him of his own impending assassination just hours before her execution and recalled the words of a wealthy industrialist, ``People are profits; individuals: losses.'' He dug out of the past a friend who committed suicide after having found freedom from an Imperial correctional institute and thought on the immoral techniques once practiced by a medical research lab on all assortments of non-volunteers. He remembered a gang of youths beating a elderly man to death because he was an off-worlder and fought back the recollection of twisted arms and limbs as all the remains of a Tizarian Foreign Embassy staff after a terrorist bombing.\nSuddenly, he woke. The familiar sickness was there, but the feeling of being forcibly thrust out of the warmth and safety of Sleep's benign womb was lost to an insidious fear, as if he had barely escaped from the black pit of an ancient nightmare.\n``You okay?''\nMike jumped, his nerves swinging his head around nearly to the point of whiplash. It was only Niki, and she promptly began her little giggle at Mike's initial surprise.\nHe looked over his research assistant with considerable distaste, ``What're ya doin' here?''\nShe drew her hands to her mouth trying to control the spasms of hysteria which only succeeded in making matters worse.\nMike regarded her with a grin, ``Fine.''\nHe groggily got to his feet as she rolled on the cold sands clenching her ribs in a coughing fit of laughter.\n``C'mon, it wasn't that funny.''\nOut of breath, she began slowing down. Mike reached for under her shoulders and lifted her small frame off the ground. She put up a mock struggle, laughing all the while.\n``Michael... No! Put me down!'' He carried her over his shoulder towards the house as she whined, squealed, and laughed.\nThe house was dark and lonely when they finally arrived. Mike walked in and tumbled Niki on the couch. She rolled herself up around a large pillow and beamed up at him with a smile. He shook his head in disbelief and grinned.\n``Aren't ya' gonna say hi?'' She was in a playful mood.\n``Hi.''\nThey looked at each other for a moment before he continued.\n``So, how's my psyche doin'?''\n``Just fine... Boss.''\n``Don't call me that.''\nShe laughed, ``Why not? Is it a dirty word?''\nHe nodded, ``Yes. And how's Mr. Fork doin'?''\n``Okay-fine.''\n``Still locked up?''\n``Yep, but he's gettin' better.''\nMike laughed, ``That's sayin' nothin'.''\n``No, Really. He's a lot better than he was. He's even beginning to talk now.''\n``What have you gotten out of him?''\n``Nothin' much so far. It's still too scrambled to tell what he's thinkin'.''\n``Bet that makes for some interesting reading though. Look, I'm gonna get a beer, ya want one?''\nHer smile faded. ``Naw, ya' don't want beer.''\n``Yes I do,'' he headed for the kitchen.\n``Drink some zardocha instead.'' She sounded hopeful.\nMike thought about it for half a moment, ``Yuchi-foo.''\n``How 'bout milk?''\nHe mimicked, ``How 'bout beer?''\n``You'll get drunk.''\nHe tapped the nozel release, and twisted the setting nob down to Niki's favorite.\nShe smiled, ``You're not gonna get drunk.''\nHe looked at her, mock-seriousness molding his features into a neutral expression. ``Do I ever?''\nShe started giggling, ``Tee hee hee... you were so surprised.'' ``Was not.''\n``Hee hee... was too.''\n``Was not you little sneak. Besides, you never told me why you were there.''\nShe stopped laughing, ``Just came by to see how you were.''\nMike glanced at the clock, ``At ten after midnight? How'd you know where I was.''\n``And I thought ya' had intelligence. Where are ya' always when its dark outside and you're too lazy to answer the door?''\nHe gulped down half the glass, ``Excuse the stupid question. I'm a little buzzed right now.''\n``Why do ya' sleep out there?''\nMike wondered whether she was requesting information or making small talk. ``You've asked me that before.''\n``Ya' never answered me.''\nMike paused. ``To sleep... perchance to dream.''\n``Did ya dream?''\nHe thought a moment. ``Yeah.''\n``What about?''\n``I dunno.''\nShe laughed, ``Liar.''\nHe sipped his milk. It was as cold as ice but felt strangely good going down.\n``Well?''\n``You didn't read me while I was out?''\n``Nah. I saw your eyes goin' though. But I still 'member when you said not to read you.''\n``I wonder why...''\n``Aw c'mon. Y'know you can tell me.''\nHe replied laughing, ``I do?''\n``Yes.'' For once, her tone was convincing.\nHe paused, ``Okay. You remember hearing about the Tizarian embassy on Calanna?''\n``Yeah, I heard got blown up. Hey, that wasn't when you were a correspondent down there, was it?''\nMike nodded, ``I was pulled shortly before that, but I was still... sightseeing.''\n``Of course,'' she was smiling.\n``Now... I had nothing to do with...''\n``Don't even try lying, Michael.''\n``Okay... well anyway, the short of it is that I was there just a cent before it happened. I went out to make this call... the embassy was a notoriously bad place to carry on a private conversation. While I was walking back... I heard the...'' He stretched out his arms to form the visual image.\n``Boom?''\n``Boom,'' Mike agreed hesitantly. ``I started running to see what happened.''\nNiki watched him sympathetically, ``No one survived.''\nThey fell silent for a time as Niki let her milk sit scarcely touched. Mike's dream had shattered her mood.\nHer eyes slowly grew glossy in the blue fluorescent light. ``I'm sorry.''\nSurprised, he looked up, ``About that?''\n``I'm just sorry.''\n``It's okay.''\nMike looked into her eyes and then averted his gaze downward toward the floor. ``Drink your milk.''\n``Mike... ?''\nMike awoke stiffly on the floor. Niki sat over him, one hand on his shoulder, gently shaking him to consciousness.\nHe squinted groggily in the dim light. ``What time is it?''\n``Twenty. Mike, Fork's in trouble.''\nMike was suddenly wide awake. ``What is it?''\n``I dunno. I think somebody woke him up in the middle of a nightmare.''\n``Enough to wake you?'' Mike asked in hopeful disbelief.\n``No. I was still up. I just happened to be open to it.''\n``Did he wake up by himself?''\n``No. I'm pretty sure somethin's up.''\n``Ok, let's go.'' Mike picked himself off the floor grabbing his black camera bag on the way out the door and headed straight for the back terrace. He hopped on the fly-cycle, felt under the seat cushion for the key, and switched on the grav-plates while Niki hopped on behind him and held to his waist.\nThe vehicle raced over the shoreline using its natural flat surface to pick up speed. The crisp ocean waves, remarkably changed in the past few hours, lashed the coast and pounded the beach crag with an unrelenting fury as the bright full moon rose to its apex in an otherwise pitch black sky.\nWithin five minutes they landed just outside the nearby Tizarian medical center. Only a mile inland, the smell of salt carried by the chilly morning breeze floated through the air. A cargo shuttle rested on a pad under a hundred meters from the complex, and two guards in dark night-uniforms stood outside the entrance in the bleak, morning cold.\nMike dismounted the vehicle and quickly trotted towards the guards.\nNiki grabbed Mike's arm cutting short his advance. ``I don't have my doctor I.D.''\nHe shrugged, ``Forget it. We'll play it straight.''\nMike stopped short of the guards and drew out his press card. ``Michael Harrison, Gatherer, Galactic Press, Tizarian Division. I need access to this facility to see one of the patients.''\nThe guard in front laughed, ``At twenty in the morning?''\n``Yes. This may be an emergency.''\nThe guard mocked seriousness, ``Well, it must be a pretty big one. What do ya' think George? Do we let little Mikey in?''\nThe other guard was older. His grey eyes depicted a sternness not much impressed by his partner's attitude. He coughed before speaking, perhaps to be sure he had everyone's attention, ``Nobody's allowed in the medical center, mister...''\n``Harrison. I'm with the Tizarian Division. I have permanent press clearance to this center. See? It says so right here.'' Mike pointed toward the card, but neither guard paid any attention.\nThe first guard laughed again, ``Hey, who's your psych?'' Niki's dark, Sirian features hinted at her purpose.\nMike talked while getting out his flimsy. ``Didn't you hear what I said? I have clearance. By the way, I didn't get you guys' service numbers.''\nThe older guard broke in, ``Look, buddy. We have orders not to let anybody in. Anybody! Do you understand? Now why don't you just hop back on your play-scooter with your girly-friend and get your snot-nosed face off our turf!''\n``Orders from who?''\n``From our commanding officer. Who do you think?''\n``Who is?''\nThe older guard shouted, ``I just said who!''\n``As in a name.''\nThe guard paused, not quite sure how to phrase his response. ''That's classified.''\nMike looked up from the flimsy. The guard who spoke reinforced his position by standing in front of the door, his plain, black uniform blending nicely with the purple background.\n``You guy's aren't even wearing Tizarian badges. Who the hell are you?''\n``Starlaw.'' The answer came simultaneously from both.\nMike shot a wary glance at the pair, ``You Imperial police have some sort of identification?''\nThey pulled badges from their pockets.\n``Why aren't you guy's wearing these things?''\nThere was no answer. Mike was fairly certain they couldn't arrest him.\n``Oh, I guess that's classified too. Look, I'd like to speak with your commanding officer!''\nThe young guard pushed Mike backward and began to draw his gun, but the other held him back, the older guard's stare belying a temptation to let his partner carry out the threat. Suddenly, Niki gasped as if shocked.\n``What is it?''\nShe paused, regaining her breath. ``He's gone.''\n``What?''\n``No more signal.''\nMike drew out his camera and backed away from the guards, pulling Niki back with one hand clenched around her shoulder.\n``Smile dudes.'' Mike snapped the shot, and retreated quickly to the cycle.\nThe personal office of Charles Linden, copy editor for the Tizarian Division of Galactican Press, rested near the top of the center section of Silver Tri-Towers. It was, as Chuck liked to put it, a room with a view. Out the sky window, if the day was clear enough, the entire expanse of land all the way to the coast could be surveyed. From well over two kilometers high, it was a wondrous sight.\nMike sat at the edge of the editor's dark, mahogany desk staring blankly out the window as the clouds blew by. Niki, leaning against the close, white wall, quietly watched his profile, collecting his emotions, reading his worries.\nThe faint noise of footsteps approached the entrance, Niki turning to look as the antique, brass doorknob turned clockwise. Linden, stood in the doorway smiling suspiciously while surveying the duo.\n``Well! If it isn't Mik and Nik.''\nMike intentionally suppressed his smile. ``Hi, Chuck.''\n``That's Mister Linden to you Harrison. So, how's it going?''\n``It sucks.'' The voice was Niki's.\nLinden turned his head toward her, leaning his body on the desk toward Mike.\n``Does it really?''\n``Yeah, it sure does.''\nLinden laughed, ``You teaching her slang, buddy?''\nMike smiled, ``Y'know, Chuck, you really have a way of breaking the mood.''\n``Yeah. I saw your entry this morning; suggested headline: `Imperial Police Seize Hospital.' Very catchy.''\n``You don't like it?''\n``First off, it isn't a hospital. It's a medical center. Big difference. Secondly, they didn't seize it.''\n``They refused my clearance.''\n``I just got off the phone with a Lieutenant Robertson. He tells me you tried to assault one of his guards.''\nMike held the smile, ``He's lying.''\nLinden confidently continued, ``He also told me you never showed your press I.D. to the guards.''\n``Chuck, he's lying.''\nLinden looked Mike in the eyes, ``Prove it.''\n``I have a witness.''\n``Do you have the encounter on crystal?''\n``No.''\n``Why not?''\n``We were in a hurry when we left. I forgot the recorder.''\n``You forgot the recorder; no substantiation. The paper gets sued. I lose my job. And as for your so-called witness... who has been illegally posing as a psychotherapist at the medical center for the past doce so that you could get a story which was never registered with the paper! What the hell are you trying to pull, Mike!?!''\n``The last time I registered a story with the paper my research assistant got her brains blown out by a firing squad!''\n``That's because all your, quote-unquote, research assistants are unregistered telepaths!!''\nNiki winced. Mike shook his head in disbelief as his boss continued.\n``Look buddy, it's not like I don't believe you. I do. But you're just doing everything the wrong way.''\n``I'm doin' my best.'' ``I know. That's 'cause you are the best... usually.''\nMike looked up hopefully, ``So what do I do now?''\n``Lieutenant Robertson is coming over. He'll be here in a few minutes. I suggest you wait around 'til he gets here. Question him. If you can, trap him.''\nLinden reached into his vest pocket and pulled out a small, pocket recorder. He placed it on the desk in front of Mike. ''You're still on Tizarian turf. Use the advantage.''\nBy that last remark, Linden meant that there were several advantages press gatherers had on Tizar which weren't granted to them on many other worlds. The right to publish recorded statements without the approval of the speaker, the right to use registered telepaths to gather information, and the right to access the non-classified records of any subject were just a few examples.\nMike sat down at the computer terminal in the far corner. Linden, a lover of antiquities, rarely ever touched it, and the file on Robertson revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The twenty-seven year old, Starlaw officer entered the service after attending Duke Marc's College. He earned a degree in Enforcement of Justice, and served Starlaw in the public relations department. He'd been promoted during his first four-year hitch and was now working through his second.\nMike looked up from the file as Linden's secretary knocked at the door to announce the lieutenant's arrival.\n``Send him in, Jo... and tell the floor that I'll be down in a few minutes.''\n``Alrighty, Mr. Linden.''\nA tall man with short blond hair and smooth brown eyes entered the office. His practiced smile was as wide as it was non-deceiving.\nLinden returned the smile, ``Lieutenant, please come in.''\n``Mr. Linden? How good it is to finally meet you in person. I must confess, I didn't know who to greet at first.''\n``That's quite understandable.''\n``You should get a videophone. That's what everyone I know uses.''\n``Yes. Well, on an editor's salary, I think I'll just stick to the basics. This is Michael Harrison, the reporter who spoke with your guards; and this is Nikita Sen, a research assistant with the Press.''\nMike smiled at the lie as he shook hands with the Lieutenant.\nRobertson also shook hands with Niki but avoided her eyes.\n``Mr. Linden. You hire Sirians. I am surprised.''\n``Why?''\nRobertson laughed uncomfortably, ``Have you not heard the Imperial convention against psionic trespassing?''\n``Lieutenant, the Psionics Suppression is a matter for historians. Besides, this is Tizar. We have been granted freedom in those areas by your Archduke's grandfather long ago.''\nRobertson seemed to physically squirm in his stance, ``Still, editor. I must insist that my mind... not be... violated.'' He smiled shyly at Niki.\nMike wondered what kind of people the Imperials were hiring, ``You've got something to hide, Lieutenant Robertson?''\n``Of course not. There are just certain classified matters... Unrelated, you understand.''\nMike smiled, ``No problem. Niki's telepathy is very... weak.'' He decided to stretch the truth, ``She can only read the answers to yes or no questions, feel surface emotions, and even for that she has to be looking at the subject in question.''\n``Still Mr. Harrison, I must insist that she at least leave the room.''\nNiki broke in, ``I don't mind leaving, but I would like to hear what is said. After all, I am, to a certain extent, involved. If I turn around, I'll be largely unable to use my telepathy. Would that be all right Lieutenant?''\nRobertson shrugged, ``I guess that'll have to do. Sorry about the inconvenience.''\nNiki smiled, ``That's okay. I'm used to it.''\nRobertson looked at Mike and began to grope for a place to begin. ``So, Mr. Harrison, the guards at the medical center told me they had a little trouble with you.''\n``I suppose they did, Lieutenant. I wanted entrance; they denied it.''\n``Well, did you tell them you were a gatherer?''\n``Yeah, I showed them my press card.''\n``Well... that's not their story. What were you doing out there so early anyway?''\n``Me and Niki suspected that something may be wrong with one of the patients.''\n``Which one was this?''\n``John Doe, number eighteen.''\nRobertson looked surprised. ``Hmmm... that's quite a coincidence. That patient died in his sleep at around midnight last night.''\nMike's mouth fell open, ``What?''\n``There's nothing you could have done. He was well on his way to the golden arches when you arrived, or wherever it is that he went. Wasn't he the insane gentleman who murdered a guard with a carving fork and injured two civilians?''\nMike tried desperately to regain his wits.\nRobertson continued, ``So, Mr. Harrison, what made you suspect that there was something wrong with the patient.''\nMike looked back up at the Lieutenant. ``Niki, turn around.''\nRobertson instinctively withdrew a step.\nMike continued as Niki turned about to face the lieutenant, ''Is he lying?''\nShe nodded yes; her eyes burning red with antipathy.\nRobertson avoided both her's and Mike's stare and turned to Linden for support. ``I doubt I'd be the first. Mr. Linden, I protest.''\nMike stood directly in front of Robertson. ``Lieutenant, what was Starlaw doing there?''\n``That's confidential, Mr. Harrison.''\n``Can't you at least tell me the branch of personnel, the name of the commanding officer?''\nRobertson shrunk under the direct questions. ``Internal Counter-Insurgency. ISIS Division. That's all I can say.''\n``ISIS?!?'' Mike almost jumped back into Linden's lap. ``The Imperial Secret Police?''\n``Please, Mr. Harrison. You have me at an awkward position. I'm only regular Starlaw.''\n``Then why are you lying!?!''\nLieutenant Robertson withdrew to the door. ``I won't stand to be interrogated in such a fashion,'' he weakly complained. ``I'm leaving.''\nRobertson opened the door and quickly escaped from the hateful stares of the three people he was sent to pacify. Mike took the recorder out of his pocket and turned it off. ``Can I publish it now?''\nLinden sat down and crossed his legs, a twinkling of a smile lighting his otherwise sharp countenance. ``No. You can go out there and get some more facts, and then come back with a real story. I've got a feeling this'll be a winner once you've got it fully researched, and I won't even make you register Niki.''\nMike smiled gravely, ``It's a little too late for that; they already know about her. But thanks anyway. We'll take the offer. We'll also try to get some more info. I'd also appreciate it if you'd keep quiet about the story.''\n``Okay. But I don't see how that's going to help you now either.''\n``Trust me, it will. Look, I'll catch you later. Thanks for the help.''\n``Ok, I'll see you two later.''\nMike and Niki exited the office. Once in the outer hall, Niki tugged at the gatherer for attention. ``Hey, ya' really know how to get people t' listen to ya'.''\nHe looked her in the eyes, ``I'm sorry.''\nShe smiled, ``About you or about Fork?''\n``I'm just sorry.''\nShe shrugged, ``Let's get some milk.''\nThe bar was cool and dimly lit. Several ceiling fans twirled silently above as Mike drank his milk on the rocks; Niki had her's straight.\n``So,'' she began, cutting the solemn mood, ``where do we start this time?''\nMike sipped thoughtfully, ``I haven't the faintest idea.''\n``Liar.'' She was smiling.\nHe grinned back and took another sip.\nShe grew impatient, ``Well?''\n``Okay. I met this girl a while ago.''\nNiki laughed, ``Is this one of your drunk maid stories?''\n``No. This happened just yesterday. I don't know whether Chuck told you, but me and him met Mr. Clay and his daughter for lunch.''\n``Boardmember Clay?''\n``Uh huh.''\n``And the girl's his daughter?''\n``Yeah. Anyway, so we talked, and then they had to leave, but that afternoon she came over to my house.''\n``Alone?'' Niki looked concerned.\n``Uh huh.''\n``And you let her in?''\n``Why not?''\nShe had no reply.\n``So anyway, while she was in the bathroom, I found out she was an android.''\n``What were you doing in the bathroom with her?''\n``I wasn't in the bathroom. I was in the living room.''\n``What was she doing?''\n``Taking her ear off, or putting it on. I don't remember, but that's not important.''\n``You saw her take her ear off. Ooh gross.''\n``No, Cindy did.''\nNiki laughed, ``What? You asked your computer what she was doing in the bathroom?''\nMike paused, ``Yeah.''\n``Why?''\n``I was curious?''\n``Have you no shame? Guy, ya' won't be seeing me go to the bathroom at your place no more.''\nMike laughed, ``Oh, c'mon. Just one more time. I want to shoot some pictures.''\nShe laughed, ``No way, bud. So what happened then?''\n``She had to take off, but I'm sure she was there to check me out.''\nNiki nodded, ``I'm sure she was, too.''\n``No. I mean for somebody else.''\n``Heck, Mike, everybody's after you. Me, an android, your computer, now somebody else.''\n``Oh, c'mon.'' ``So where's Clay's real daughter?''\n``He doesn't have one.''\n``You mean, Mrs. Clay gave birth to an android?''\nThey both laughed.\n``Look, stop it. I want you to check up on her... and on Mr. Clay.''\n``I can't read an android.''\n``Read Mr. Clay then. No! Wait a mil, it was his niece, not his daughter, his niece.''\nShe laughed, ``You've really got your facts straight.''\n``I was recovering from a hangover at the time.''\n``Excuses. Excuses.''\nThey laughed and ordered some more milk.\nShe began again, ``So what about Fork. I mean, this could be a dead end.''\n``I'm fairly sure his mind was shot by one of those Imperial mind scanners. They probably just decided to kill him.''\n``Why?''\n``I dunno, and that's no lie.''\n``What do we do?''\n``You do nothing.''\n``Aw, c'mon. I wanna help.''\nMike refused, ``No, they already know about you. I want you where you can do some good. Clay doesn't know about you, and I've got a suspicion he's tied up in this.''\n``How's that?''\n``I think I remember seeing Robin, that's his niece's... I mean android's name... I swear I remember seeing her down at the medical center one of those times I visited Fork.''\n``Then she'd know me.''\n``Nope. You're not registered. I am. She wouldn't have any reason to remember your face unless you spoke to her or something, or unless you were registered with Galactic Press, and you're not...''\n``Ya' don't think Mr. Linden would say anything about me?''\n``Nah, Chuck doesn't talk to Boardmembers. You're in the clear.''\n``What about you?'' She knew the answer to that without asking.\n``I'll manage. Look, I'm gonna go home and grab a quick nap.''\n``Liar.''\nMike smiled, ``Look, I'll be okay. I promise. Come see me tonight.''\n``You mean next morning?''\n``Whenever. I'll see ya' later.'' He got up and headed toward the exit.\nNiki put down her milk, ``Be careful.''\n``You too.''\nNiki stayed at the table as the highbowls slowly rose to the ceiling and coasted across the bar. From the opposite aisle a burley man in a heavy, tan coat rubbed a lather of foam from his moustache, his eyes scanning the morning headlines as they scrolled across the surface of his table. In the background, she heard a group of people laughing. Michael didn't want to be followed. She glanced toward the escalator ramp and watched a sprinkling of people zoom by, the cushion of propelled wind whining where its outskirts met the stop-off. The bar seemed warm and snug when compared with some of the other places she had been recently; it was a good place to stay and pout. But not as good as a Boardmember's house. She smiled at the thought as she threw on her wrapper.\n``Are you family?'' The nurse's eyebrows wrinkled in rehearsed concern as he scratched down Mike's name and Tizarian I.D. number.\n``No, but will this do?'' Mike showed the nurse his Galactican press clearance. The shiny blue and silver card was nearly identical to his Tizarian personal identification or his Imperial consumer profile. The three were hard to tell apart at a glance.\nThe young man nodded in acknowledgement and hurriedly escorted Mike through the long white corridors of the medical center. The usually polished floor tiles showed dirty tread markings where a pair of wet, oversized starlaw boots had recently stomped. Mike grinned and snapped a picture though he doubted that analysis of the photo could tell much more than the boot size and service division of its wearer.\nThe air felt slightly colder as the nurse pushed aside a set of green double doors. The word ``Freezers'' was painted in icy blue across their surface. Mike followed closely.\n``So what d'ya want with a 'corpsicle' anyway?'' The nurse smiled at his own joke. He was being too smooth. Mike guessed that they were giving him loads of preferential treatment because they were scared silly of the bad press he could inflict.\n``It's a long story.'' Mike bent over the computer and with a few quick keystrokes he scanned the registry of the dead. Niki had taught him how the system worked last month and the lesson came back to him as quickly as were it taught yesterday. Such were the benefits of being lectured by a Siri, Mike thought as the nurse approached the terminal.\n``Hey, wait a second buddy.'' The nurse was visibly surprised, but he scanned the screen seeing Mike had found his way through the system.\n``He's gone.'' Mike closed his eyes in the anticipated frustration. It was too much too expect that the Imperial police would leave his subject's body on site. That would make verification of the time of death too simple a matter.\n``I thought you guys held a patient's body for autopsy.''\n``We do. At least we're supposed to.'' The nurse hit a few more keys and scanned the screen for more data.\n``Here. The verdict was heart attack due to the stress medication. It happens occasionally. The body's been taken to Greenflower mortuary.''\nThe news startled Mike momentarily, and he wondered what the Imp's motives could be. He pushed himself away from the console and straightened out, slowly perceiving the implications. The nurse gazed up from the computer and tried to read Mike's expression.\nMike finally smiled, ``At least Fork's going out in style. Say, you got a spare hour?''\nSurrounded by lush costal woodlands and set around a wild flower garden, Greenflower easily rated as the prettiest community in Silver-Tri county. It was small, quiet, nearly perfect in every way. Mike would have lived there, but it lacked in one crucial respect: no beach.\nMike watched the passing trees and sighed as the nurse suddenly turned delivery boy drove the white grav-car along the highway. The med-center was being too kind but totally predictable, loaning him a nurse and a car, all to straighten out its reputation with one reporter from a very powerful news syndicate.\n``I hope you're enjoying this.'' The nurse sounded slightly irritated.\n``Sure am. Watch out for the cat.''\nSmall rain droplets marched steadily up the windshield and swerved sideways with every curve in the road as the sun poked between the clouds with sporadic recess, its rays shattering into a kaleidoscope of colorful, dancing patterns.\nCruising at a hundred kilometers per hour, the grav-car sped over the highway at an approximate altitude of one meter. Mike thought that it felt like they were floating on a current of air though he knew that wasn't the case. They were floating on the force of gravity which was really the curvature of space. Mike's mind began to swim with equations learned in a series of undergraduate science courses he had been dragged into by a friend. Something about down-vectors and Higgs boson emissions. He couldn't quite remember who to hate for it. Mike had always liked science, but never enough to actually understand it.\nThe nurse pulled up to the mortuary and gently touched earth. Outside the deep grey building a small service seemed to be taking place. The dark gloomy afternoon made the mourners looked like an assembly of Draconian diplomats dressed in sleek black suits huddling together exchanging whispers. Their somber mood was catching.\nMike climbed from the car and headed warily for the mortuary. A pit of ashes was exposed to the rain about a hundred feet from the building's entrance, green clover petals curving in along its red brick walls. The nurse, genuinely fascinated, stopped to look down. It was archaic. Almost barbarian.\nMike entered the building's lobby while the nurse ran to catch up.\n``What'd you see?''\n``Nothing. It was too dark,'' the young man puffed catching his breath.\n``May I help you, gentlemen?'' A middle aged woman with a pale complexion suddenly appeared as if from thin air. She was dressed in a long black gown and wore a black pearl necklace.\nMike took out his press clearance, ``I hope so. I'm looking for a man, I mean a body of a man which was brought here this morning.''\nThe women seemed strangely amused. ``Does this body of a man have a name.'' Her words sang out like music.\n``He was listed as a jay-dee eighteen from Silver-Tri costal med-center.''\n``I see,'' She seemed absolutely enthralled.\nMike smiled, ``Great,'' then consciously dropped his smile. ``Where is he?''\nShe slipped between Mike and the nurse and crept to the lobby entrance, opening the large oaken doors and pointing her long slender arm toward the ash pit. Mike watched the rain fall in disappointment.\nThe setting sun's amber beams tanned the evening coast, streaming thoughtlessly past the white water's edge, scattering sullenly across Michael Harrison's tired features. He watched two gulls, wings outstretched, gliding peacefully over the shifting blue and crimson waves, hanging precariously onto the thin salty air. As if beckoning him forth, the sea approached within inches of his face and then receded into the distance while thoughts twisted about in his mind like delicate angels on their way to a darktime's meal.\nBut something was missing; something was overlooked. And for the life of him, he didn't know what it was. What to do when you're deadended? Go back and re-examine the facts. But there were no facts. Everything was hidden behind lies.\nUnable to sleep in his only true home, he picked himself up and walked back toward the house. The huge wooden doors seemed even more menacing when sober, but he managed them open and headed to the kitchen for a brew.\nHis soft bed and cold beer summed up the perfect way to spend an evening, but as he sat on the edge of the covers the camera drew away his attention. Near the wall, it sat on the rug where he had dropped it less than an hour ago as if pleading like a child for a trip to the zoo, ``take me a picturing, I want to have fun.''\nMike smiled and stretched out on the floor beside his toy. He opened the workset and began to review the pictures in memory. He zipped past a Telmarian mountain range where strange animals carried supplies across a snow ridge to the local guerrilla faction, then floated along Tizarian waters as a shuttle from nearby Aquapolis darted from under the seascape in a beautifully chaotic conglomeration of white water spray and a rainbow of sunshine, then noticed a Calannaan temple where the altar priests sacrificed a political dissident with knives and a chainsaw, but only one picture grabbed his attention-- that of two starlaw guards scowling outside a medical center entrance in the wee hours of morning.\nMike pivoted the picture into different corners of the screen and tried to decide where it would look best hanging from the wall. He reversed the colors, intensified the light, rotated the picture around, zoomed out for a wideangle, and suddenly noticed what was missing.\nThe small distorted numbers mocked him from the far corner of the screen. He manually zoomed in on them and refocused. How could he be so stupid? The medical center had no permanent cargo shuttle. The vessel must have belonged to the Imperials.\nHe looked toward the controller wall, ``Cindy, load file from Silver-Tri. Find Imperial shuttle 8372919041.''\nShe responded within the second, ``That shuttle is found.''\n``Where is it now?''\n``Docked onto the independent fast-merchant, Nissithiu, which has jumped out of system fifteen point two centims ago.''\nThe idea itched like a hunch sent by the devil, ``What was the cargo?''\n``It was dropping off pharmaceutics.''\n``Departure cargo?''\n``None.''\nMike leaned back on the bed, ``That's pretty strange, leaving a world as wealthy as Tizar.''\nCindy gave no reply.\n``Where is the ship headed?''\n``Flight orders don't state.''\n``They should.''\n``They don't.''\n``Then read topside nav-data and figure it out.'' Mike hated lazy computers.\nCindy came back to him after a few seconds, ``This will take me twenty-four point seven centims to compute.''\n``Why so long?''\n``I'm not a navigation computer.''\nHe shrugged, ``Fine, Take your time.''\n``Now computing,'' she responded as if more than a little annoyed.\nMike grinned. She'd be working until well past midnight. At least he now knew how to keep her busy.\nAs he stepped back outside, beer in paw, he shot the dying sun a victory smile and sat down on the damp sands under a chilly wind. Then, curling up next to the surf, Mike closed his eyes and tried not to dream. Songs of water and birds soothed him with a serenity beyond mere music as he drifted away to other seas.\nSlowly, his soul floated about in black and empty space. Silently, a touch from above pulled him away from sleep's cherished womb. Sounds of music, songs from the sea, clustered around him like the players of an opera theater, sinking in and out of the void with a strange, perhaps arranged harmony.\nShe bore no expression as he opened his eyes. He felt himself gripped with a strange combination of confusion and fear as the black sky above cast a bold contrast around her disarranged golden blonde hair and deep blue eyes.\nShe smiled sweetly whispering, ``Good morning.''\nFor a moment, he felt as if he was dreaming, but the rush of questions was uncharacteristic of sleepthink. In dreams he could accept that life was death and good was evil, but on the surface of thought there was only the here and the now and many, many questions.\n``Why are you here?''\n``We found your psyche.''\nThe cold tide washed the tips of Mike's toes as a cool, salty breeze lifted a few strands of Robin's hair.\n``Drop the story, or you'll never see her again.''\nRobin walked slowly up the beach as Mike sat still in the sand watching the ocean horizon curve away into the distance.\nDawn was particularly brilliant along the coast, a primary reason for his choosing to live there. Mike watched the sunrise with a rueful stare as the dull, throbbing pain stuck like a stiff arrow in the base of his skull. Bitterly, he picked his sand encrusted self off the beach and headed wearily toward the house. Grains of earth fell off him with each dismal step.\nThe large livingroom reeked of a dreary gloom. Mike glanced toward the couch and the pillow where her head had rested two nights before. He walked sullenly into the bedroom. The far curtains remained closed, dimming the room. The chain locket she'd given him rested on his bed with the camera.\n``Hello.''\nIt beeped compulsively as a point of light danced around the controller screen.\n``Yes?''\n``The Nissithiu went to the Calanna star system.''\n``Oh.''\nMike tumbled the junk off the bed, all except for the locket. It was in the shape of a heart with words inscribed along the front: ``Go For It!''\n``Place audio connection call to Linden.''\nThe light danced around the screen.\n``Done.''\nMike gathered up his breath.\n``Hi, What's up Mike?'' It was Linden's voice.\n``Morning, editor.''\n``Yes, and a very nice one it is too. Is there anything I can do for you?''\nMike consciously tried collecting his spirit.\n``Why did you tell Clay?''\n``What?''\n``You heard me.''\n``I don't understand, Mike. What happened?''\n``They've got Niki.''\n``... You think I told Clay about her?''\n``I know you did, Chuck. I just wanna know why.''\n``Now don't start hurling accusations, buddy. I didn't say a thing to Clay or anybody else. Now, tell me exactly what happened. Did she screw up or something?''\n``No.''\n``Well, how do you know?''\n``She's not a screw-up! Okay?!''\n``Well, I didn't say anything. Editor's honor, Mike.''\n``Bullshit.''\n``The honest truth.''\n``No, it had to be you.''\n``Nope.''\n``Chuck, if I find out later...''\n``I'm clean.''\n``Chuck... stupid question coming up...''\nMike scratched his head with the locket searching for the right words.\n``You ready?''\n``I love dumb questions. Shoot.''\n``When's the last time you had your office checked for bugs?''\nSilence.\n``Chuck?!?''\nThe line was dead.\nJim is a full-time MBA student at UC Riverside.

The analysis specialist scanned his expression.\n\"There's no way we can trace manufacture; it's just too far gone,\" she explained.\n\"Have you found anymore?\"\n\"Nearly a dozen,\" Charles Linden broke in, somewhat heatedly. Mike could almost see his boss's anger steaming off the heavy overcoat he wore to protect himself from the lab's sub-zero temperature.\n\"I don't understand it at all,\" he continued. \"Why would Clay go to all the trouble? And what's so important about this dead John Doe?\"\nMike glanced at the specialist who seemed to be examining the editor with an unconcerned stare. He hoped she wasn't the type to blab.\n\"Look Chuck, there are warmer places to discuss this.\"\nLinden was keen on the idea of getting out of the lab, not so much because of the third party with ears and a mouth as due to the chill. He and Mike took the lift down to the subways leaving the company security personnel to the unhappy clean-up their own incompetence had prompted.\nThe subway train to Greenflower was nearly empty, and the trip uneventful. Linden was, for once, totally unconcerned about what was happening on the floor. The scores of staff writers would just be sending him more meaningless trash which he would later strip to the bare facts and send back due to lack of content. It was always the same old story at the middle of the week.\nMike promised something far more interesting for the readers, and for the editor as well. Linden had suddenly taken a personal interest in the story, a big no-no in his business. But it was worth bending a few rules, and it felt right. It was even worth a trip to the pit of ashes.\nThe late morning air warmed Linden as sunshine broke through the white fluffy clouds and streamed down in long silver threads from the heavens. He hiked alongside Mike etching a trail through the dew-sodden expanse of grass. Birds were darting about in the brisk morning air. Their songs were like a child's laughter, almost mocking yet innocent.\nThe pit suddenly lay before them, its sides sinking into the earth without warning. A variety of religious symbols decorated the inner surfaces informing wayward souls to beware the footsteps of the dead as the familiar sweet scent of ash and apple resin hung heavy in the air. Linden sat down on the red brick lifting his chin and squinting at Mike through the bright beams of sunlight.\n\"Not what you expected,\" Mike cautiously broke the silence.\n\"No,\" Linden admitted. \"It's too...\" He couldn't pull off the words.\n\"Antique?\"\n\"Old fashioned. It's too dated.\"\n\"I thought you were into that, Chuck,\" Mike prodded smiling.\n\"I am, but there's a limit. This is so undignified. It's a mass burial.\"\n\"Just another screwed up religion.\" Mike stretched out his arm pointing down the pit approvingly, \"But you have to admit, they did a great job.\"\n\"What? I don't follow.\"\n\"The Imps. They kill Fork, and get rid of his body so perfectly that there's no way I can get a confirmation on the time of death.\"\n\"Sure, but why the mass burial? Why not just cremate him and leave it at that?\"\nMike kicked a stone into the pit, \"Because he isn't dead.\"\n\"You just said they killed him,\" Linden countered.\nMike shrugged, \"I lied. If they just wanted him dead and gone, they'd have done what you said.\"\nLinden stood up. He glared at Mike in spontaneous disbelief but knew the reporter well enough to realize that doubting was useless and quite possibly counter-productive.\n\"Explain,\" Linden finally insisted.\n\"The Imps want to stage a fake death. They snatch Fork and put some poor fool in his place, kill the guy and send the body to the incinerators. But that still isn't good enough. They now have to get rid of the remains in a legal manner, but in such a way that these remains cannot be later analyzed to prove the guy who got burned wasn't Fork. Even ashes can be analyzed. Admittedly, it isn't something we often do, but it can be done. People don't often share identical body chemistry. A mere difference of as little as a gram in solid weight would be enough to...\"\n\"Enough,\" Linden interrupted, \"I've got the idea. The only legal way to dispose of the ashes in a manner in which they cannot be later analyzed is to mix them with other ashes. Thus, the ash pit.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nLinden laughed, \"It's a really neat theory Mike. Now prove it.\"\nMike looked at the wet grass in front of his feet, \"If I try, I lose Niki.\"\n\"What makes you so sure you haven't already?\"\nMike considered the editor's question with antipathy.\n\"I know what you're thinking, Harrison.\"\n\"Do you?\"\n\"I've already sent for company personnel, off planet. They should be here in a few days.\"\n\"Chuck, if we had a few days, we wouldn't be talking.\"\n\"Regardless of all other considerations, I won't use our current security staff to deal with this... situation.\"\nMike shot his boss a rueful grin, \"You don't trust them.\"\n\"After what happened... would you?\"\n\"We can always go to Tizar police. Even though she's unregistered, they've been supportive in such matters before.\"\nLinden shook his head in flat refusal, \"You know as well as I that the paper cannot risk this getting out.\"\n\"She's a friend, Chuck.\"\n\"She's also a psyche. And Clay is a damn boardmember. There's no win here; we have no choice but to wait and let company people handle it.\"\n\"If we wait, it may be to late.\"\n\"She's already lost, buddy. If you think you'll ever see her again...\" Linden cut himself off mid-sentence. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"It's okay. You're probably right.\"\n\"So what are you going to do?\" The editor carefully enunciated each syllable with the utmost patience.\n\"What d'you think I should do?\"\n\"If they're hiding, we must chase. I'll get one of the paper's private starships to take you to Calanna. I know you didn't have much fun last time you were there, but like they say, duty calls.\"\n\"Fine, but don't stick me in some ice box.\"\n\"I wouldn't dream of it,\" Linden pledged. He knew well Mike's distaste for low passage.\n\"And what about Niki? If there's any chance...\"\nLinden gazed back into the pit for some inspiration, but the same anger kept welling within him. Mike studied his boss as the sunlight shined off Linden's black boots and whisked the corners of his eyes.\n\"Whatever you do between now and the time you leave is your own business,\" he insisted. \"You understand?\"\nMike and Chuck took the escalator down to the floor from p872. As they entered the ten acre room all they could hear was the clicking of fingers on keyboards and the dull chatter of hundreds of gatherers. Linden's press office lay at dead center, and a small group of grouchy staff writers wandered about outside the entrance.\n\"Why the committee?\" Mike wondered allowed.\nLinden explained, \"There's been talk of a strike. Haven't you been reading the paper?\"\n\"Must have missed it. Serious?\"\n\"They just like making waves.\" It was one of Chuck's pet phrases. Staff writers and clericals were both labeled as replaceable by management. If they decided to strike, there would be no problem finding new recruits. For this reason, their union demands were generally ignored. But even so, they still liked to stomp around and threaten the editor every other year or so. Mike was glad he wasn't following it.\n\"I guess you read the news once and you've read it a thousand times,\" Mike quoted.\n\"Watch that kiddo.\"\nThey went their separate ways, and Mike felt the better of it. He didn't envy Linden's job in the least.\n\"Hey, Harrison. Haven't seen you here in a while.\"\n\"Hi, Mike.\"\n\"Hey buddy, where've you been?\"\n\"Walker. Kim. Chris, I've been sick.\"\n\"I see the boss is catching it too. I hope you guys've been having safe sex.\"\n\"Chris, you're an asshole.\"\n\"Happy birthday to you too, buddy.\"\nCome to think of it, Mike didn't envy his own job either. Not that he didn't like gathering. He just didn't like many gatherers.\nThere also came those moments which he genuinely regretted. These he called mistakes. Being seen walking in late with the editor was but one example. He hoped he didn't just call too much attention to himself. Having a trail of story-starved gatherers tagging along could seriously jeopardize his chances of sneaking up on Clay.\nMike sat down at his desk and switched on his terminal scanning the latest breaking headlines.\n\"Staffwriters Prepare For Strike\"\n\"Youth Locked In Freezer Eats Own Foot\"\n\"Upcoming Press Banquet...\"\n\"So what's up?\" It was Bill Walker. He was another crack investigative gatherer. Not very successful, but crack all the same. His youth was his greatest advantage and his biggest stumbling block. Mike could remember what it was like.\n\"Not much. How 'bout you?\"\n\"Nothin'. Did you see the one about the banquet? You're gonna be speaking.\" Bill knew how much Mike hated to read the paper and thus usually never got word about these things until it was too late to make reservations for an interstellar cruise.\n\"The one before it looked more interesting. You write it?\" Mike accused in his most inquiring tone.\n\"Wish I did.\" It was something Bill would write. He had a flare for the gory.\n\"Where'd you get cut?\" Mike just noticed Bill had a nasty slash under his left ear taking the whole length of cheek down to his dark sunburnt chin.\n\"Mama did it,\" he laid out. There was a glint of amusement in his grey-blue eyes. Otherwise he seemed deadly serious.\n\"Walker, you've got a sweet mama.\"\n\"She is.\"\n\"But you're a sick bastard.\"\n\"Do you really mean it?\"\nMike turned back to his headlines pretending he had serious work to do.\n\"I really got into a fight with my neighbor's cat.\"\n\"That's really fascinating.\" Mike mimicked Walker's distinctive \"really\" without effort. It was a common part of their interaction on the rare occasion that both were on the floor.\nMike didn't mind the wasted time. He knew it would pay for itself eventually. Walker was young and often useful when he wanted to be. He and Mike worked together occasionally on the difficult parts of each other's assignments. Mike sometimes thought of himself as a kind of mentor teaching a newcomer the tricks of the trade.\nBut as much as he liked working with Bill Walker, he knew the young man was also dangerous to be around. He took too many unwarranted risks as far as Mike was concerned. He got himself into scrapes that he'd have to fight himself out of. But as the boss would often testify, it was all part of the job.\n\"So what's really going on?\" Bill asked an hour later as he finished picking the seeds out of his xisimo core. His elbows rested on the clear surface of the table as he tossed slivers of the fruit cut by his laser knife high into the air and caught them smoking between his teeth. This was one reason the cafeteria staff insisted they sit in the corner, Mike thought.\n\"You're about to catch your tongue on fire.\"\n\"Only if I miss. C'mon Mike. I need a story. The well is dry, buddy. I'm dying of thirst.\"\n\"So you want to steal mine?\"\n\"I've shared with you,\" Bill acted hurt.\n\"Yeah, shared crap.\"\n\"C'mon Mike. Admit it. You need me.\"\n\"Like I need my penis to fall off,\" Mike agreed thoughtfully.\nBill ignored the comment, \"Remember that time on Telmar? Who saved who? Huh?\" He pointed the blade of his weapon at Mike, \"You owe me one.\"\nMike gulped down the last of his beer and hoped nobody was listening.\n\"Hell, you owe me two. Remember...\"\n\"I wasn't aware we were counting. But now that we are, how many do you think you owe me?\"\nBill estimated a number in his head. Then finally gave in with a sheepish look, \"Okay, I'll drop it.\"\nMike spent most of the afternoon on the computer running searches on Clay and beginning a journal for the story complete with facts, photos, and tapes of conversations. Everyone else was minding their own business which was nice for a change, though they didn't seem to have very much to do. Private reports kept coming in, forwarded from Linden, on new melted pieces of metal being found in Chuck's private residence and on his clothes. There was even one under the seat he sat in during lunch. Such is the life of an editor, Mike smiled.\nHe kept smiling until his searches started coming up negative. Clay seemed to have disappeared over the past two days except for one use of his corporate credit card at a shop in Aquapolis just that morning. He bought an expensive tie.\nOtherwise, zip. He hadn't signed any business or legal documents. He wasn't at his office. He wasn't at his flat in Silver Tri. He hadn't been using the subway. He hadn't so much as peed in an executive toilet. Dead end, pure and simple. The only good thing Mike could tell was that he certainly hadn't left the planet. That would have made things a little too complicated.\n\"I can tell you where Clay is.\" Mike turned with alarming speed, almost giving himself the second near-whiplash of the week.\n\"You've got to break that habit, Mike. Seriously.\" It was Bill again.\n\"What the hell do you want, Walker?\"\n\"I can tell you where Clay is.\" This time it registered. Mike opened his eyes wide, then looked around to be sure nobody was listening.\n\"Where?\"\n\"Snow Country. He's staying in a friend's cabin. Some sort of ski vacation.\"\n\"What friend?\" Mike nearly growled it.\n\"Some sort of business associate with the paper. I don't remember the name, but I can find out.\"\n\"How do you know this?\"\nBill shrugged, \"If I told you... maybe it would rain for me.\" A smug grin crossed his lips, but his eyes remained laser sharp, like the knife he carried for \"occupational emergencies\".\n\"You want in on this one?\" Mike hated to offer, but he had little choice.\n\"You don't have to let me in if you don't want to.\"\n\"In or out? I'm not saying please.\"\nBill considered it for all of two seconds, \"Okay, I'm in.\"\nThe infrared goggles penetrated the icy pitch darkness, making the chimney top of the well-insulated Solomon mansion seem like a beacon of light on an otherwise frozen landscape. Mike bit his upper lip as he lay prone in the snow, considering the fair possibility that Billy's grapevine might be wrong.\n\"Thank mama there's no wind,\" Bill whispered. Mike smiled at the phrase. Clay would have thanked the lord; Mike might have thanked the night, but Bill would thank his mama.\n\"Thank mama they've got a fire going,\" Mike countered. Bill quietly agreed. The house might have been doubly invisible without it.\n\"So get goin',\" Bill prodded.\nMike dropped the goggles and crawled over the hard slippery ice away from his flycycle. He hoped the vehicle would carry three on the off chance they'd find Niki inside.\nAs Mike quickly reviewed the plan in his head, he began to wonder if the computer's information was up to date. It showed three entrances to the house; a front, a garage, and a servant's entrance. In fact, it gave him the entire floor plans including electrical access, water, and sewage piping which he and Bill studied most of the evening. Being a reporter on Tizar accorded some amazing privileges.\nMike reached the garage. The door had a hard polymer bolt fashioned to undermine the courage of any would-be thieves. He couldn't see it, but he knew a fancy security alarm would be hidden behind. All the locks would be like this one if the computer told the truth. All would be difficult to saw. At least here he wouldn't be heard.\nThe borrowed laser knife switched on silently. The little bit of light that it shed was enough for Mike to see what he was doing, though he didn't need the luxury. He knew exactly where to make the initial incision killing the alarm as it were. The rest was grunt work as laser grinded against polymer. Now, it was only a question of time.\nMr. John Clay relaxed in a cushioned rocking chair as he warmed his feet by the fireplace. It was quaint but effective, he mused as he slowly rocked back and forth, like fire itself. He glanced at the wooden chessboard where he had defeated his host, Mr. Solomon; the two kings now stood alone face to face at center board. Not very happy was he, Clay almost giggled. The corporation did not encourage good losers. In that, he was somewhat of an outcast.\nHe knew he had failed, but at least he was finished. Now, he would soon leave Tizar and return to the home of his childhood. He smiled faintly at the thought.\nSuddenly a noise thrust him to full consciousness. Someone was yelling and slamming his fist against the front door.\n\"Who could it possibly be at such an ungodly hour?\" Clay got to his feet, hoping the sound hadn't awakened his host.\n\"I'll get it, sir.\" Marley, the night guard took only few seconds to appear from the kitchen area. He seemed stiff and angry.\n\"Open up! Please hurry! Someone... Oh, thank goodness. You've got to help. There's been a terrible accident. Do you have a videophone?!\"\n\"Who are you?\" The guard's face was stern as he looked over the young man. His long stringy black hair was wet from the snowfall, and he held a heavy steel flashlight in his right hand which he kept shining in the guard's eyes.\n\"Oh please! Let me in. It's a matter of life and death! I've got to use your videophone. There's been a terrible accident...\" The young man was panting from exhaustion.\n\"Where?!\"\n\"Out there,\" the young man, exasperated, waved his arm back into the darkness.\nMike quickly cut through the lock at the back of the garage leading into the storage hall. Hearing the commotion up front, he slipped into the hall and ran to the kitchen area. The polymer bolt had taken more time than he anticipated. He had to hurry. He reached the security office just a minute behind schedule.\nThe office was full of little television screens, and there was a desk with a control station. An eight-pack of fun-punch was set on the floor next to the largest screen where the highlights of a tourist hunting safari were being broadcast in via satellite from the far side of the planet by channel #117 sports. Mike scanned the other monitors and saw the recording light on one. He grinned when he saw Bill's face, desperate, nearly frantic. Bill was always good at diversions.\nMike took out the current disk being recorded and slipped it into his pocket. He grabbed a blank from the desk and melted it down with the knife in one swift stroke. Then, by flipping a few red switches, he disconnected the batteries and shut off power to the entire mansion.\nThe guard turned around in surprise when the stairwell suddenly darkened. He didn't have time to feel the blow to the back of his skull. He was already unconscious.\nMike raced into the room. The fire and the knife blade were the only sources of light in the entire house. Clay stood motionless, hoping he wouldn't be noticed.\n\"Morning, Mr. Clay.\"\n\"Good morning, Michael. You wanted to see me?\"\n\"Well, yes, sir. I was hoping to talk to you about how irresponsible the press has been acting lately. It's a damn disgrace.\"\nBill walked in, now competing for stage presence. \"To think a few reporters could spoil a whole code of ethics through some gross dereliction of duty.\" He was shaking his head sadly, and he homed in on Clay.\nMike continued, \"Overzealous is perhaps more the word. Derelict implies neglect. What do you think, Mr. Boardmember?\" Mike held the blade to Clay's throat, igniting the bare traces of aftershave near his chin.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"Niki. You. Robin. Not necessarily in that order.\"\n\"Your research assistant is upstairs in the south guest room. You can go get her.\" Clay's breath was heavy with fear.\n\"Lend me the flashlight, Billy.\"\n\"It broke.\"\nMike pivoted his glance, \"You hit with the back.\"\n\"I know. I forgot.\"\nClay strained a smile, \"If you two professionals don't mind being interrupted, I happened to notice that the guard was carrying...\"\n\"Sit down and shut-up.\"\n\"Merely trying to be helpful.\" He sat back down in the rocking chair.\nMike stripped the flashlight off the guard's belt and picked up an automatic pistol and a pair of handcuffs to boot. He gave the knife to Bill and wrapped Clay's arms around the back of the chair, securing them with the handcuffs before he headed upstairs. Slowly, carefully, he measured each step as he neared the top of the plush stairwell searching for the barest reason to shoot someone. The south guest room was just down the hall. He found the door unlocked. Niki was inside, on the bed, heavily sedated. Mike picked her up gently, very much relieved to find her unharmed. Content with his prize, he climbed back down the stairs.\n\"Okay sport, where's Robin.\" Mike set Niki's limp body on the floor by the guard.\n\"Asleep, upstairs.\"\nBill rocked the chair roughly at the answer. \"I wasn't aware androids slept.\"\n\"She likes to pretend.\"\n\"So she's heard everything.\"\nClay offered a smile, \"No, she shuts her senses down, except for touch.\"\nSuddenly, the stairwell light came back on. Mike whirled around to face the kitchen. He lifted the gun half expecting to see Robin running in to save her master. Clay had, of course, lied. Mike inwardly debated blowing the old man away right there. He could almost see the image of blood cascading through the air as the chair would rock backward plunging its occupant into the fireplace. Mike nearly smiled at the thought.\n\"Mike...\"\n\"I know. Get Niki and get out of here.\" He tossed Bill the flashlight.\n\"What about you?!\"\n\"I'll think of something. Go!\"\nBill didn't argue. He dragged Niki out the front door as fast as his feet would carry him, leaving Mike with Clay to wonder how many bullets it would take shatter the circuits of a pissed off android.\n\"She's very cunning, Mr. Harrison. You'd best be careful.\" Clay seemed amused. He's trying to distract me, Mike thought.\nIgnoring Clay, Mike slinked quietly toward the kitchen entrance, wondering with each ill-fated step how good the android's hearing was. Exceptional, he supposed. The designers could make her as well as they wanted. He tried to make his breathing silent, but he only succeeded in noticing every small sound he made whether it was a footstep, a breath, or even a heartbeat.\nSuddenly, the door swung open. Miraculously, he squeezed off a shot in time. Her head snapped back from the impact, but it didn't stop her. She struck him with phenomenal force, and Mike felt as if his entire chest were caving in. In another moment, her hand darted up. That was all he remembered.\nIt was a little like watching the stars fall. The cold coastal breeze gripping and then letting go, the tan sands which seemed rather darker than tan, and that distant disoriented feeling would combine on rare occasion when the stars fell from the sky.\nMike saw the stars falling clearly enough. He could feel the chill. But it was the disorientation that stole the show. He made numerous attempts at standing, but he never quite managed it. The ground seemed to rock like a see-saw back and forth as he lay down, and whenever he tried to get on his feet, he'd upset the balance and the entire room would turn upside-down and send him crashing to the ceiling and after a moment back to the floor again.\nHe heard voices far away almost shouting. They seemed to be very angry voices, but he couldn't understand the words. Suddenly he knew the language was foreign. Then he heard a girl giggling, but he couldn't place the laugh. It was a sweet innocent laughter which reminded him of the birds singing at Greenflower. But it was very near. Mike thought he could touch it if he reached out his arm just far enough, but suddenly it ceased. He knew she was close. His hand searched for her, but she wouldn't be found. He crawled toward her for a few feet, and then slumped down in despair.\nHe was too tired and she was too far away. Instead, he listened carefully for her laughter. But she was gone.\nThe nose of the kayak climbed quickly over the tall wave, slicing the crest in half before plunging back down to meet the next. Its occupant paddled furiously against the wind, straining frantically to beat the next rise before the sea engulfed her vessel. Her long slender arms gleamed in the morning sunlight, their dark, Draconian tones accented by a rich, brazen glow. A sudden gust of air almost capsized the boat spraying a salty white foam against her long, black windswept hair. She breathed deeply in exhilaration and struggled to keep the kayak upright. Out in the open sea, several kilometers from any land, she was beginning to lose her personal battle of wills against the elements.\nShe noticed the brilliant silver frame of the hydrofoil from the corner of her eye as it approached. The craft sped over the water in front of her, only its three skinny legs touching the water. They barely seemed to connect at all. Agyris poked his dark smiling face out the window as the pilot crossed her path.\n\"Had enough yet?!!\" he shouted.\nShe turned her watch transmitter back on, knowing her weak voice wouldn't carry as far as his.\n\"Almost, give me another cent.\"\nHer aide's voice broke over the transmitter, \"Old Johnny's on the Coral. It looks like a situation has developed. It's urgent.\"\nShe cursed under her breath. \"Okay. Bring the Coral in to get me.\" The next wave nearly rolled her over, and she turned the kayak around so that she wouldn't have to fight the wind or tide.\nAgyris' hand flapped out the window as the hydrofoil sped away. She heard his voice over the transmitter, \"Ambassador Uhambra is ready now. Coral steer fifteen degrees starboard and proceed at fifty knots. Pick-up at six-hundred and forty approximate. Over.\"\nShe leaned back letting the kayak drift with the tide while avoiding the brunt of the cold wind at her back. The sky was a pale blue without a cloud anywhere in sight. On the eastern horizon, Tizar's brilliant tangerine sun seemed to shimmer through the wide expanse of atmosphere. She saw purple-brown dots when she blinked and decided to refocus elsewhere.\n\"Ahoy there!\" The first mate was waving from the deck. He wore a striped blue and white shirt with a sunny face. He tossed a hook, and smiled down at her as if expecting some reward. She hooked her kayak and climbed aboard, as he manually wheeled in the small craft.\n\"Where's mister problem?\" she absentmindedly inquired, reaching for a towel. The first mate smiled through the pained and exhausted look he liked so much to wear in the company of superiors. She guessed it was his idea of looking busy.\n\"O'er there, ambassador.\" He nodded his head toward the cabin as he wrestled with the wheel.\n\"Don't strain yourself.\" She wrapped the white towel around her tall slender frame. It was a sharp contrast to her black swimsuit and dark, suntanned skin.\nJohn Clay opened the cabin door and walked out onto the deck. Bags drooped under his usually alert, crystal-blue eyes. He wore a white business suit. She remembered he had a number of them along with a collection of expensive ties. It was considered ancient custom with the corporation; but on Tizar, it was contemporary fashion.\nShe stared at him silently with her dark brown eyes. She would let him confess incompetence and beg for another chance before patting him unforgivingly on the head and sending him home. As usual, he waited for the first mate to leave the deck before beginning his report.\n\"Ambassador, it is good to see you vibrant and alive and as young as ever.\" She sensed the vague tone of disrespect, the way he said young. Was he envious?\n\"I'm older than you, Johnny.\"\n\"Yes, the miracle of anagathics. It never ceases to amaze me. So lucky it was for you that you became a diplomat and not a sleeper.\"\nShe bit her lip in aggravation. \"Not luck. What brings you here this time?\"\n\"I have bad news to report.\"\n\"Again?\"\n\"The Solomon residence was broken into early this morning by that reporter. We captured him, but his accomplice escaped with the Siri. Together, they have enough evidence to support...\"\n\"Let me guess... a police investigation.\"\n\"Or worse still, a full divisional security review. And that's far more likely.\" Clay's hands were wrung together, his knuckles white from lack of circulation.\nHe continued, \"This could all have been avoided if we had simply killed Harrison and his Psyche as I advised...\"\n\"How did they learn of your whereabouts?\" She ignored Clay's complaint. They both knew it had holes.\n\"We're checking into that now.\"\n\"Did you redirect all your people to new controls?\"\nHe nodded, \"Yes, but...\"\n\"Well, that's all that really matters then. After you leave, they can investigate all they want, it won't do them a bit of good. Do you have a list of your redirections?\" He handed her the envelope.\n\"What was you're method of communication?\"\n\"Non-electronic, of course.\"\n\"That leaves quite a lot of room.\"\n\"Sealed paper envelope. Like this one but with coded orders.\"\n\"In person?\"\nHe hesitated, \"Yes. It was safer and fairly quick. And I used private transport.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Where what?\"\nShe bit her lip again, \"Where was contact made?\"\n\"A few at their residences. They spread the word, and the rest came to receive orders at Solomon's...\"\n\"Right in the middle of Snow Country?\"\n\"It's fairly out of the way.\"\n\"What about the security disk for that day?\"\n\"It was destroyed by Harrison. He had to protect his accomplice.\"\n\"You're sure? We can't have that thing floating around.\"\n\"Would you like to see its remains?\"\n\"Not particularly.\" She wondered if he was trying to be funny. \"When you leave tonight, take Solomon with you.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nShe smiled for the first time since seeing him. \"Is that all then?\"\n\"Not quite. I'd like to know what we're supposed to do with Harrison.\"\n\"Have you interrogated him?\"\n\"Not yet.\"\n\"Wake him and do it. Report back if he has anything interesting on his mind.\"\n\"If not, can I kill him?\"\nShe laughed, \"Would it give you great pleasure?\"\n\"On the contrary. I'd like to keep him alive for torture. He's only ruined everything.\"\n\"All right. You can do with him whatever your little heart desires. I emphasize little heart, because I know you very well. That's if and only if he refuses to cooperate. However, if he has something interesting to offer, see if there's a way to avoid murder. He's quite possibly the top gatherer on Tizar, maybe even in the entire sector. There will be a storm in the press if he just disappears. See if there isn't a way we can use him to our advantage. He must have some sort of connections. And find out how much he knows. It'll give us a good idea where we stand.\"\nClay nodded, trying consciously to make a mental note of every order. He knew he wouldn't try hard to make Harrison talk. It would be fun getting rid of him.\nMike awakened slowly, his body stretched like a slab of meat along a tightly strewn grav-field, its invisible coils suspending him horizontally, tugging his arms and legs in separate directions. He glanced about the large, dimly lit room, its sharp, jutting contours and lack of furnishing serving a dull reminder of his helpless position. A large window along the far wall overlooked a blue-green seascape, gaeyave and shallowfish swimming slowly past the plastic brace, while another creature with long clear tentacles attached itself to the smooth surface. Mike peered between its suctioning arms wondering if he was dreaming. He could barely make out the blurry lights of Aquapolis in the far distance.\nRobin leaned with her back against the glass and watched Mike while the drugs slowly lost their grip. As his eyes focused on her dark outline they seemed to close on the neat puncture wound in the center of her forehead. His legs began kicking in a pathetic sort of dance as he tried to physically squirm out of the gravity cell.\n\"We had to put you in there. You kept on hurting yourself.\" She approached him cautiously.\n\"You didn't have to dope me up. How long has it been?\"\n\"Not long.\"\nMike stopped fighting the field. He tried to relax and think of a way out, but he was out of ideas.\nHe looked her over. Robin wore a pair of blue coveralls. A headband hung limply from her front pocket.\n\"Sorry about shooting you.\" He tried to make it sound genuine.\n\"Quite all right, Mr. Harrison. I understand your motives.\"\nHe wondered how much an android could understand.\n\"Besides,\" she continued, \"it was about the best place you could have aimed.\"\n\"No brains, huh.\"\nShe patted her chest.\n\"Well, it doesn't look good.\"\nShe seemed to laugh inwardly as Mr. Clay glibly strolled in, \"No, but it will heal.\" He looked very self-assured, even a little cocky. \"Robin is very hard-headed, Michael. May I call you Michael? The bullet you fired simply bounced off. The skin which was torn is constructed with a biochemical agent not unlike that found in mendwear. Bed off.\"\nThe grav-field slowly rotated Mike into a standing position. He looked at Robin. She smiled as if on display.\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" Mike tried not to sound too irritated.\nClay pondered the question for a moment, his thin, white brows furrowed in self-restraint. \"Because I like you...\" he managed with a sarcastic twist to his voice.\nMike let a smile creep across him face before plunging, arms outstretched. He felt his body sheathed in fire, burning alive even as he brushed by the old man and hit the floor, his inflamed arms crackling and spitting like dry driftwood over an open barbecue.\n\"What you are now experiencing, Michael... is our cooperation inducing system. It consists of a series of electrical implants in your brain... which are capable of constructing a wide array of phantom sensations... when properly instructed.\" His booming voice slowly slipped to its usual volume as the flaring pain evaporated.\nMike felt his head, naked flesh and electrodes.\n\"You bastard.\"\nClay smiled at the remark.\n\"Why the hell are you doing this?\"\n\"I'd like to get to know you... get to know your work?\"\n\"Why should I tell you jack-sh...\" Mike hit the floor as the electricity scathed through his mind, his head throbbing in illusory explosion.\n\"I believe you will find our methods quite convincing.\"\nMike tried to talk, but the pain forced his mouth shut, his neck curling backward in agony. Gasping for breath, he refocused his eyes. Robin stood over him, her foot resting softly on his chest.\n\"I don't know... you want...\"\n\"Now we're getting somewhere aren't we...\"\nRobin blurred into the ceiling, its dark surface pressing on him, pushing him deeper into the floor.\n\"We want to know... how we can help... do we?\"\n\"Ye...\"\n\"What's that, Michael?\"\n\"Yes...\"\nThe pain faded slowly, the pressure falling away like storm clouds over the coast, raining then leaving in gentle succession. Clay regarded the young man with antipathy, the body tangled in grotesque torment, and without a single scratch. He much preferred real torture, the sort that you could see and have respect for; but that could wait for later.\nRobin picked Mike's head off the floor and let it drop. \"He's unconscious. Automatic depressants registering in the forward cranium.\"\n\"That's no fun... let us wake him.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Do it.\"\nDark brown eyes burst open as the chemicals neutralized in wave after wave of mind splitting torment. Clay's smiling face loomed above like a bobbing floater.\n\"Tizar to Michael... are you still with us? I hope that was as good for you as it was for me, Michael. Because, to be absolutely honest, it doesn't get much better; but we will try, won't we.\" He winked toward the silhouette sitting quietly against the window.\n\"Go ahead...\"\n\"What's that, Michael? Are you actually cognizant? Have you a thought to share?\"\nMike felt Clay's glaring eyes upon his face even as he closed his own.\n\"...before it dies of loneliness? Go ahead... what?\"\n\"Kill me...\"\nA long silence passed before Mike opened his eyes. Clay looked astonished and insulted.\n\"Kill you??? Why in heaven's name should I do a nasty thing like that? I want to be your friend. We are friends... aren't we, Michael?\"\n\"What the hell do you want from me?\"\n\"You mustn't be difficult, Michael... it's a naughty thing.\"\nBurning sensations tore through Mike's body for a fraction of a second as he turned to look again at Robin.\n\"She controls it, Michael... she could kill you on a whim... except, of course, for the obvious fact that androids don't have whims. Lucky for you... isn't it?\"\nMike griped bare floor as the pain coursed through his veins. He twisted about, vulnerably, clawing toward her with floundering motions.\n\"But since you've been such a good sport, we're going to keep you company for a while longer. Are you feeling cooperative yet?\"\n\"Tell me what you want.\"\nClay acquiesced, \"Very well, let us start at the common ground, just to see what we both know. Tell me who killed our esteemed friend, Mr. John Doe number seventeen.\"\nMike stopped and thought as the pain released its hold.\n\"Who... Fork? You want to know who killed Fork?\"\n\"I believe I have made myself abundantly lucid, Michael. You were aware of them. We know you visited the pit.\"\nClay first heard a chuckle, then a snort, then a laugh, then a sound he couldn't place in any interrogation he had ever participated in or heard of. He looked down at the billowing figure in amazement and then back toward Robin.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nShe nodded her head, nothing.\n\"Michael, either we've pushed you completely over the edge, or...\"\n\"Fork isn't dead.\" Mike tumbled himself into a sitting position, holding his side with one hand and wiping away tears with the other.\n\"You are insane.\"\nMike beamed up, the laughter leaving him as the memory of pain crept back into his mind.\n\"You don't believe me, Clay... flush me out the torpedo tubes.\"\nThe old man smiled at the suggestion.\nClay wasn't convinced, \"If he's alive, then where is he?\"\nMike rubbed the metal connections on his head.\n\"Where is he!?!\"\nThe dim flicker of pain approached his senses and veered away as he steadied his gaze on the dark outline against the wall.\n\"I'll do it, Michael.\"\nThe moment hung open like a sputtering ocean swell refusing to die.\n\"In transit to Calanna.\"\n\"And how do you know this to be true?\"\n\"A little birdie told me. Look, Mr. Clay, I'm a gatherer. I've got ways of finding things out.\"\n\"Connections?\" Clay seemed intrigued; whether out of playfulness of genuine belief, Mike couldn't tell.\n\"That, investigation, and sometimes just a little intuitive reasoning.\"\n\"What did your little break-in this morning constitute. Investigation or intuitive reasoning?\"\nRobin told the truth; he hadn't been out very long. Mike wondered how far it was to the surface.\n\"Mr. Harrison,\" Clay skipped to the surname as if he were beginning a long lecture, \"It seems as if we have fallen into a double-checkmate. Do you play chess?\"\n\"On occasion.\"\n\"Double-checkmate is the game's one fault; it is shall we say, the impossible outcome. Yet, in reality, it is all too common. Rarely, instead of there being a winner and a loser, both parties lose.\"\n\"There's always stalemate...\" Mike involuntarily slid backward an inch as Clay glared at the interruption.\n\"Not the same, Mr. Harrison. One is more a tie than the other.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"We have forced each other into unacceptable losses, and foolishly. We are not enemies. If anything, we both want to see this Mr. Fork as you call him returned to Tizar, alive and well.\"\n\"Then why did you kidnap Niki?\"\n\"You were interfering with my work. You were investigating me. And furthermore, you were drawing attention to Mr. Fork. I am convinced that if he were not the subject of your obtuse scrutinies, Imperial attentions would never have been attracted.\"\n\"ISIS.\"\nClay smiled and folded his hands over his belt.\n\"What part in this do you play, Mr. Clay?\"\nThe old man's skin tightened involuntarily, \"Again you probe me, Michael.\"\nMike looked at Robin. Her outline seemed to shimmer against the dim, blue light of the seascape.\n\"Fine. I'll forget you. I'll forget I ever met you. But just what are you proposing?\"\n\"That you go to Calanna in search of this Mr. Fork. I would like you to find him and bring him back here to Tizar.\"\n\"And what will you do? Linden already knows that you planted those bugs.\"\n\"What I will do is unimportant.\"\nMike smiled in disbelief, \"I know Chuck. He doesn't take security lightly. I really doubt that he'd just put this to rest.\"\n\"He has no choice. You have no choice. Or would you rather be fed to the fish?\"\n\"Look, I'm just saying...\"\n\"Mr. Harrison, you are not in a position to debate me. Will you do as I bid? A simple yes or no will suffice.\"\nMike considered it, even though he knew Clay was right. He had no choice. They had no choice. That was the beauty of double-checkmate, or mutual assured destruction as most folks called it. It was a lesson history had invariably taught every culture. And in each culture it had a different name.\n\"Okay. I guess you've got me. I'll convince Chuck to stay cool, and I'll go to Calanna.\" He didn't mention that the latter was already decided.\n\"And you'll take Robin.\"\n\"And I'll... now hold it just a minute.\" Mike raised his hands in protest.\n\"And you'll take Robin.\" Clay held all the cards, and he knew it. Mike realized it was pointless to debate.\n\"Fine. I'll take her.\"\nJim is a full-time MBA student at UC Riverside.

He vaguely wondered what he would tell Linden, trying to rehearse the words in his mind. \"Oh, remember that guy with the android who kidnapped Niki and bugged your offices and home? Yeah, he's really an okay guy. I was just talking to him this morning. He decided not to jettison me out his torpedo tubes. Isn't that the nicest thing?\"\nRobin was in the next room prying about, trying to glean information about him from every facet of his life. Boss's orders, she explained, but she approached the assignment with a curiosity beyond mere orders. He hardly knew her and she was already getting on his nerves.\n\"Okay. Dry now.\" The spray shut off and short blasts of warm air jetted from the sides of the stall. A clear bowl-shaped device lowered itself from the ceiling until it surrounded his head. He shut his eyes as hot air jets whipped around his ears. In a few moments Mike stepped out of the stall and looked for the threads. Robin had laid a black three piece suit out for him. He hated formal wear, but he knew the occasion warranted it. Quickly dressing, he grabbed a comb and then set it back down as it scratched bare flesh. He found a formal hat beside the imager.\nRobin, dressed in a long white evening dress, sat on the couch bent over the Niko camera system with its various parts sprawled across the living room floor. She had been sifting through pictures in storage and apparently one had caught her fancy.\n\"What're you up to?\" Mike approached cautiously remembering the last night's incident and the pain she could inflict.\n\"I didn't know you had another Siri. Who's this one?\"\nMike glanced at the picture on the screen. A young Siri woman, perhaps five years older than Niki, stood facing a large triangular lake finished in polished black stone centered around three fountains outlined by the dim amber light of Calanna's dying red sun. Her eyes, dark and bitter, seemed to cast a shadow across the black stone tiles upon which naked symbols were etched like tortured spirits, bonded to the stone for all eternity. Mike remembered the sacrificial alter for all its beauty and pain; and as if by reflex, he reached to the monitor and the screen went black.\nRobin looked up startled, \"I was just looking.\"\n\"She was an old friend. You wanna go?\"\n\"There's still another hour. What's your hurry?\" She stood up and walked into the bedroom.\n\"Nothin'. What's yours?\" Mike packed the camera into its case and continued to ponder what he would tell Chuck. He walked to the bedroom, pausing before the door, reflecting what Robin might be doing. He tried to take into account the fact that she was an android, but with everything that happened, it still seemed impossible.\n\"I always did like a girl who was straight-forward.\" He smiled at the poor taste of his comment.\n\"Excuse me?\"\nMike entered the room to see Robin hooked up to the computer system via a thin clear cord leading into the comm-socket from her ear. Suddenly he found it not so hard to think of her as an android.\n\"What are you doing to Cindy?\"\n\"Talking,\" she smiled. \"You have everything locked up real tight. No access to private files.\"\nMike felt relieved. For a moment he debated inwardly between snapping her cord or just yanking it out of her ear. The thought made him grin.\n\"Cindy, give Robin all the information you have on the Nissithiu.\"\n\"It is done, Michael.\"\nRobin unplugged and the thin cord automatically retracted into her head. Mike felt generous, as if he had a choice in the matter.\nRobin stared at him for a moment before speaking. \"What makes you so sure?\"\nMike shrugged, \"The facts fit. C'mon, let's go see Linden.\"\nThe subway to Greenflower was slower than most since it traveled above the surface for much of the ride. Mike imagined that its architect preferred monorails with their visual entertainment of clearings, crop-land, and rolling hills speeding quickly by the windows to the functional subways which moved a person tens of kilometers in a matter of a few minutes without anything to look at except bare earth along the way. True, the subway to Greenflower was more pleasant than most, but it wasn't really a subway.\nRobin didn't seem particularly impressed, however. She kept studying Mike and the other passengers, and when she caught Mike watching she even faked a yawn. It didn't bother Mike, but he didn't like it either. If she was going to fake a human characteristic, better that she should fake being delighted to see the trees dashing by or the rushing sound the wind made whenever the tracks would turn. That was what he liked so much about Niki. She was always so happy just to experience and be alive. That was what he envied most about her ever since the day he met her at the Psi Institute on Tizar after his last return from Calanna. He liked her so much he didn't even bother checking out the full range of her talents, and when he had found out how limited they were, Mike still decided to keep her on.\nNiki was not nearly as talented as her predecessor in the picture, but she was happier all the same, though even that could become irritating sometimes. Robin on the other hand was either dead or cruel. Mike smiled at the thought, because he knew he was being too judgemental, but it seemed true all the same. Robin had her excuse, however; she was an android. Her makers wouldn't program her so she could have a good time. Anything as state of the art as herself would have some purpose. Mike, on the other hand, was human. He wondered what his excuse might be.\nThe train pulled into the Greenflower station. The Lion's Den was only on the neighboring hillside looking down over a bluff onto the inland town. It was perhaps a twenty minute walk, fifteen if they hurried, two or three if they took a taxi. Mike felt like walking but realized he wouldn't have a choice as two men in green uniforms entered the compartment.\n\"Galactican security,\" one drily announced, \"Please come with us.\"\nEvery mega-corporation was like a nation state; they all had their own private police, whether the company specialized in cargo transport, starship construction, agricultural production, or news gathering and dissemination. The Galactican was no exception, and on every world under its scope it recruited from the ranks of the planetary ground command. The people they invariably got were low quality mercenaries who couldn't cut it in an interstellar outfit. That knowledge kept the ground cop humble in comparison with his starlaw counterpart. It was a quality Mike appreciated.\nThe two security officers led Mike and Robin to a grav-car outside the subway. The cool evening air enveloped them as the taller of the men fiddled with the electronic keypad-lock. The other rested his hand on his holster, his rough fingers lightly touching the handle of his automatic, while his eyes stared at the back of Robin's neck. The gun looked like army ordinance. Mike guessed that the short clip contained armor piercing bullets.\nOnce inside the car, they sped up the hillside toward the Lion's Den. With variable altitude control, the ride was non- stop; and cars on cross-aisles sped above or below at intersections. Within two minutes they had settled outside the banquet hall, the tall statue pillars of the building suggested a certain elegance of manner which Mike knew would be lacking within. The tall officer motioned for Mike to follow as he withdrew from the car toward the white stone building.\nMike looked over his shoulder as the shorter guard stood blocking the door, \"What about her?\"\n\"She stays here,\" the tall one answered.\nMike followed the security officer into the building, noticing familiar faces smiling and nodding in every direction. Linden sat at the front table flanked by the departmental heads. Mike approached cautiously, catching Linden's eye as he walked toward the table.\n\"Mike!\" It was Niki. Bill stood behind her, his long dark hair combed back and knotted. Several heads turned suddenly from the crowd.\n\"We thought you might not...\"\n\"I know,\" He cut her short. \"What did you tell Chuck?\"\n\"Everything,\" Bill responded first. \"When you didn't come back... what happened?\"\nMike scowled, \"Things are screwed up. I've gotta see Chuck.\"\n\"Hold on a sec...\"\nMike cut through the crowd toward the editor. Linden wore a blue suit and a confident smile. He stood up as Mike reached the table, and several of the department heads followed the editor's example, offering their hands to Mike as the guard took an unobtrusive position in the background.\n\"Gentlemen, you know Mr. Harrison.\"\n\"Good to see you again young man, you're doing a great job for the paper.\"\n\"I hear you will be speaking tonight, Mr. Harrison.\"\n\"That was a brilliant piece on Telmar.\"\nMike shook their hands and exchanged pleasantries before pulling Linden aside.\n\"Chuck, we have to talk\"\nLinden kept smiling, \"You bet.\"\n\"Now.\"\nOnce they were outside, Linden dropped his show smile, \"Okay, what happened.\"\nMike let out a long breath, taking his hat off as an opener. Linden blinked with astonishment at the shaven head and short metal barbs.\n\"...what the... you okay?\"\n\"For starters, I've got to wear these until I get away from our psychotic, android friend. Clay wants me to take Robin to Calanna to find Fork, and I don't think he's an Imp.\"\n\"He's not,\" Linden stopped staring when the hat went back on. \"We checked over that disk you stole from the Solomon estate. The one you planted on Niki for us to find.\"\nMike nodded, \"Anything juicy?\"\n\"It seems a lot of people were visiting Mr. Solomon that day. Many are listed as tourists. Other's as diplomats. We think they may be spies.\"\n\"Azazi?\"\n\"Draconian Corporation. You stumbled onto something very big.\"\nMike tried to puzzle everything together in his head, but none of the pieces matched.\n\"Have you informed the government.\"\nLinden shook his head, \"And blow the story? No way.\"\nMike gulped down wondering how long he could go to prison for concealing information about Draconian spies. He finally looked up, \"What do I do?\"\n\"Take her to Calanna. Get into her programming over there.\"\n\"We can do that better over here.\"\n\"No,\" Linden stared into the reporter's eyes. \"Mike, we've already agreed that somebody had to get into my office and home to plant those bugs, and that somebody was probably in security. If they have and agent in security, they could just as easily have ten in technical. Get the job done on Calanna. It'll be more quiet that way.\"\nMike looked down to the grassy turf below his feet, \"Okay. Get me a ship and I'm off.\"\n\"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that more than generous introduction. It is certainly a pleasure to be here, and to speak to such a distinguished assemblage of colleagues, employers, and guests.\"\nThere was a titter from the audience as Michael Harrison surveyed the banquet hall. There were easily over a hundred people present and none who knew what he was about to say, himself included. Mike tried to concentrate on what they wanted to hear, but his head was still dizzy from the events of the day, and he felt a cold sweat beneath the hat as the metal implants began to itch.\n\"As Mr. Jaden pointed out, I've been working for the Galactican for a very short time, and my work experience often borders on the fantastic, so whatever advice I have to share with my colleagues, whatever incriminations I have to send to my employers, and whatever insights I have to give to our guests tonight, should all be taken with a granule of sodium-chloride.\n\"Investigative gathering is a very individualistic effort; everybody in the business has their own style and way of tackling a case, so be forewarned that what works fine for me will probably fail miserably for you.\"\nThis time there was laughter from the audience. Mike began to relax and let the words flow. His trick was just to keep speaking and never really think about what he was saying. As long as his mouth kept moving, shovelling out the meaningless phrases stuck together with the pointless glue that was public speaking, he'd be through with his obligation in no time.\nBut underneath the cool exterior his mind began to wander away from the speech. Being an engaged speaker was what they taught in oral communications. He remembered the class well enough. He remembered two of his instructor's pet phrases: \"Reach out to your audience;\" \"speak with them, not at them.\" Mike inwardly smiled remembering how he had passed the class: by being disengaged. Speaking was frightening enough, let alone engaged speaking. Mike always had an alternate method, for almost everything. He liked to experiment until he found out for himself what worked best.\nThe same was true with investigative reporting. Some guys would read the morning updates until they found something interesting, and then they'd go and research a spin-off. Others would carry a team of news-hounds, usually young people just entering the workforce who were looking for a few extra credits. Mike decided to rent-a-psyche.\nHe could have found John Doe #17 any of the other ways, but the fact was that Niki found him the day she visited the med-center for a psi-rating test. She had contacted the institute on Tizar and they referred her to Dr. Albertus. After the test she was still keyed-up and open to psi-emissions as they were called. That was the day they brought Fork into D-ward.\n\"D\" was for Disaster. He had been apprehended in a cafeteria at the starport with a bloody fork in his hand. It was the real kind, not like the grav-utensils which couldn't hurt a flee. He must have been from off-world. There was no record of him anywhere in the planetary directory. And to top it off, he had no identification what-so-ever. Niki just happened to sense his total confusion while walking by the two nurses who were transporting a wacko to solitary, bound in a straight-jacket and tied to a stretcher. It had been in the updates, any nurse news- hound could have called somebody on the floor, but as it happened, Niki spotted the opportunity and took it. That's the way the dice fell, and Mike couldn't say he was any happier for it.\nFork was messed up, that anyone could tell, but what nobody had known was that the damage had been the result of a mind- scanner. It took a trained \"psyche\" to know that. Even sophisticated medical equipment could miss it. It was that little bit of knowledge which everyone else had carelessly avoided that gave Mike a story. To each, his own.\nThe mind-scanner was an expensive piece of technology far more advanced than the sensatizer Mike had so recently experienced. It attempted to do what any well-trained Siri could do, read the mind of its victim. Victim was the word to use, because mental damage was often associated with over-zealous use of the equipment. If someone was well trained at hiding a secret inside their mind, all that there was to do was kill a few brain cells until such training departed. And then, sometimes, the scanner wasn't used to get secrets. On rare occasions, it was used to maim. Mike believed that Fork's was such a case; and he believed that the Imps were the responsible party.\nBut how did the Draconians enter into it? That was the piece of the puzzle Mike couldn't place. It hinted at something much larger in scope, something which dwarfed both Mike and Fork and all of Tizar. It was the real itch that he couldn't yet scratch, until he got to Calanna.\n\"Being a reporter for an interstellar news syndicate also has certain fringe benefits, not entirely immaterial. For starters, nobody wants to piss you off.\"\nMike looked around. Everywhere he saw people laughing. He hoped they were laughing with him and not at his obvious lies.\n\"Another, and this one is just as critical as it sounds, is that often if there is an important public figure you need to interview, that person will generally take time out of their busy schedule to get some good press, whereas if you were working for some two-bit firm out of Arcadia...\" he stopped for a wide if sheepish grin, \"I hope there's nobody here from Arcadia tonight...\" The audience was loving it.\nExcept for one person. She sat in a corner near the back. Her dark features were not so stern as they were indifferent, but her eyes were as sharp and cold as steel. She seemed vaguely unimpressed, and Mike felt his heart skip a beat as she stared directly through him.\n\"The last fringe benefit I can bring to mind, tonight, is that after the story is written and published and read by the masses, the reporter gets to speak to a distinguished assemblage of his colleagues, employers, and guests. That's always a lot of fun.\"\nThe entire audience tilted on the edges of their seats, hands poised in clapping-position.\n\"And with that I'd like to return control of this honors banquet to one of my most esteemed employers, your friend and mine, Mr. Ray Jaden. Mr. Chairman.\"\nMike hurried away from the lectern amidst raucous applause from a mostly standing audience, and took his seat next to Niki and Bill. They both congratulated him with pats on the back, and Mike guessed that the speech went okay, though he still hadn't the faintest inkling to know what is was that he said.\n\"Nice speech buddy.\"\n\"Thanks Bill.\"\n\"... cept, next time I'd leave out that part about taking a dump outside the Cubbyhole.\"\nMike turned around, \"What?\"\n\"You 'member. When we came back from Telmar and got...\"\n\"I didn't.\" Mike felt his mouth drop open.\nBill's face broke into a grin, \"Just kidding, Mike.\"\nMike sighed with relief as Walker laughed, \"You have to admit, I had you goin'.\"\nBill Walker was one of the few people who really knew how Mike worked. Mike tried to teach him everything, and in the end he'd taught Bill too much. Now he'd do his best just to hide things from the younger gatherer.\nMike looked over his shoulder and saw the woman in the corner. She was still focused on him. He turned around but could feel her stare boring into the back of his skull. Her face was familiar, but he couldn't place it. Some foreign official, he decided.\n\"Bill, who's the woman in that corner in the white dress, nothing over the shoulders. She keeps looking over here.\"\nBill took a half turn using the full extent of his peripheral vision, which was far better than most people's. Mike figured that he had lots of practice.\n\"She's turned around.\"\n\"Well, she was...\"\n\"Wait. It's Draconian Ambassador Kato. Don't you read the paper? Oh, of course. Look who I'm talking to. Forget I asked.\"\n\"Don't let it happen again,\" Mike used his best Draconian accent. It sounded absurdly frustrated, and Bill laughed.\n\"I think she likes you.\"\n\"Shut-up.\"\nNatasia Uhambra Kato was the permanent Draconian envoy to Tizar. It was uncommon for her to attend social gatherings unless she was required to do so by her office. Mike figured that drastic circumstances had called for drastic measures. But what did she hope to accomplish?\n\"Here comes the booty, mate.\" Bill looked pleased with himself as Jaden placed a tray of wall plaques on the table beside the lectern. He had a list of \"winners\" in his left hand and a glass of water in his right.\n\"This could take awhile.\"\nBill smiled back, \"Should we pick up the yawn patrol.\"\n\"But that would be rude,\" Mike countered as he began his first glorious yawn of the evening. Bill attended with voluminous seconds.\n\"Our first award goes to one of our speakers tonight, a gatherer who has done a splendid job for the Galactican, and a close personal friend of mine.\"\n\"I wish he hadn't said that,\" Bill slowly began to struggle up from his seat.\nMike placed a hand on his shoulder, \"Sit down.\"\n\"This gentleman has preserved the sacred trust our paper holds with the public, that of reporting the truth as it is, without reservation and without dramatization.\"\n\"At least we know it can't be you.\"\n\"Shusshhh...\"\n\"He headed the best-selling issue of the Galactican this year with his front page article headlined, `Telmar Prepares For Civil War' which I might add, was quite accurate if we are to have any faith in the current news.\n\"His articles and essays are insightful and are a fine example of the very best in journalism. With that, it gives me great pleasure and pride to award this plaque to Michael J. Harrison, for his contributions to the Galactican.\"\nAs Mike accepted the award there were resounding cries for another speech, all of which died down as he resumed his seat. It took an act of will to not sneak a glance toward the corner of the hall. There was something different about her.\n\"I hope you're not reading me.\"\nNiki turned, startled, \"Somethin' the matter?\"\n\"I'll tell you about it later.\"\nThe plaque wasn't especially impressive. Mike wondered if they imported the silver ore from Telmar. Jaden continued to hand out various other plaques to various other people for various other accomplishments while company photographers stood around snapping images.\n\"I wish I had one,\" Bill interrupted Mike's thoughts with his most sullen voice. He looked like a four-year-old who lost his lollipop.\nMike stuffed the plaque in Bill's jacket pocket.\n\"Hey...\"\n\"You can change the name.\"\nBill laughed, \"Hey, thanks dude.\"\n\"Anytime.\"\nAs the tray grew empty, Mike noticed that he and Bill weren't the only one's yawning. However, nobody had the guts to make for the door. Mike knew that the first person to break open the doors and leave would cause a tidal-wave of people to follow, but nobody dared start the congestion.\nFinally, Jaden congratulated the readership, everyone who came, and everyone who didn't get an award but thought they deserved one all the same. With the final laugh, he declared the ceremony complete and adjourned the congregation. The rabble, anticipating the clap of the gavel, were already on their feet with more raucous applause, but this time with constipated steps as they tried to squirm outside and perform their relative duties to nature. Mike laughed remembering the Cubbyhole.\n\"Are we having fun yet?\"\nMike gave Niki a hug, \"We're about to.\"\n\"Michael...\"\nLinden approached from behind Niki, \"I got that ship.\"\nMike looked over her shoulder, \"How soon?\"\n\"It's at the starport in pre-flight. Hanger 183.\"\n\"Accommodations?\"\n\"Four.\"\n\"Okay, thanks Chuck.\"\nNiki tugged Mike's arm, \"What's goin' on?\"\n\"Get your stuff packed, you too Bill, we're going to Calanna.\"\n\"Now?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nBill headed toward the doors muttering something about his mother. Niki followed, and then suddenly turned.\n\"What about you?\"\n\"I've got everything I need.\"\nShe turned and ran out after Bill.\n\"Mike,\" Linden turned back to face the reporter. The multitudes were still bumping their way outside amidst the congestion at the Hall's entrance.\n\"What is it, Chuck?\"\nThe editor's hands were wrung into a knot as he tried to lean casually against the lectern. He smiled his real smile for the first time in the night.\n\"Nothing... Good luck.\"\nMike nodded, \"Thanks.\"\nOutside the air was cold, not at all like the balmy summer nights on most of Calanna. Mike saw the dark figures recede into the distance, climbing into their chauffeured limousines, a sign of their decadent elegance. The security officer stood beside the company gravcar. He was looking for Mike amidst the approaching crowd. Mike guessed that Robin was still tucked away inside. It would have been a long wait for a human.\n\"Mr. Harrison.\"\nMike swung around abruptly, barely catching his head in time to keep the hat from falling off.\nThe Ambassador smiled and tried unsuccessfully to stifle a giggle, \"I'm sorry if I surprised you. My name is Natasia.\"\n\"I know.\" He reached out his hand to shake hers. He wondered if there was some other sort of protocol.\n\"But my friends call me Nuke. Don't worry,\" she withdrew her hand abruptly, \"you don't have to kiss it or anything. I'm not Imperial royalty.\"\nHer long dark hair shined in the moonlight. She was a tall as him, but very slim. She suppressed another giggle rather poorly, and her face glittered with amusement, but her eyes told a different story.\n\"Can I help you Ambassador?\"\n\"No.\" She waited for her reply to sink as she smiled seductively, \"I wanted to commend you on a brilliant speech.\"\nMike wondered if she was being sarcastic or giddy.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"You are welcome.\"\nHer eyes glimmered with icy bemusement as the reply sank deeper into his mind. Something within them toyed about an idea, as if she were sifting though his memories for an occasional... stolen disk.\n\"What do you want? You want to know something.\"\nShe studied him for a moment, \"I already have what I want. You've told me everything.\"\nMike clenched his fist, knowing he'd given away his thoughts.\nShe put her hands on his shoulders and rubbed her thumbs into the fabric of his collar while staring into his eyes with a message of sympathy.\n\"Yes, you have. Now I want you to have a safe and happy trip. And be sure to find Mr. Fork. He's very, very important.\"\nA dim, filtered luminescence clung to the cold air as Christina Quatalis re-checked her flight instructions for the fourth and final time, shaking her head with a now comfortable disbelief. The recycler hummed in a shaded corner of the bridge as the computer silently reconfigured her upper boards to account for the installation of turbo-fan chemical jets into the IFM Vista's tertiary ports. Hazel eyes scanned its progress, reading the textures of data with a mixture of apathy and distrust. Over the bridge IC she heard Rrkal's husky voice shouting obscenities amidst the dull background chatter of ground techs.\nShe opened her line, \"Some sorta prob, engineering?\"\n\"Captain?\" It was Victor. His York accent was easily discernible over any transmitter. \"Com-beta on the third tube is right out. If we had another day we could make repairs, but not in space.\"\n\"Typical ISS surplus. Don't sweat it. We can still route navcom through manual.\"\n\"Only if we tear open your panel. And then we'll probably have to reconfigure the whole system from scratch. Is it really worth it?\"\n\"We haven't any choice. We're taking-off in five hours.\"\nThere was a growl from the other end.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"Never mind. It's not repeatable.\"\nChris smiled, \"Tell Rrkal to watch his lip. I want you back up here to chart our course.\"\n\"I thought our course was already registered.\"\n\"Just get up here; there's been a slight change in plans.\"\n\"On my way.\"\nThe bridge lights flickered as local batteries kicked in. It was one of Rrkal's ways of letting everyone know when he was annoyed. Chris punched up another channel.\n\"Gunnery, are you ready for the Jane's files on Wasps.\"\n\"Ready Freddy,\" Rita's voice crackled over the IC.\n\"Sending now...\"\nMike cautiously stepped onto the maintenance grav-plate. The congested workspace of Hanger 183 made him feel conspicuously overdressed. Robin dangled her legs over the edge of the plate as it slowly lifted to the spacecraft above. Large spotlight attached to the wall illuminated the aft of the vessel as water vapor condensed and frosted along the fuel hoses and quickly sublimated back into the air a few meters down the line. A large Vargr, his coveralls stained with lubrication fluid, barked directions to the starport maintenance personnel from a small engine port. An expression of distaste seemed to cross his black, furry snout as he sniffed the pair's scented formals.\n\"Y'da pass'ngerz?\"\nMike stepped onto the cold, steel hull extending his hand, \"That's right. My name's Mike.\"\n\"Rrkal,\" the Vargr shot Mike a toothy grin and turned toward the airlock. \"Da stat'rhoomz don'da lif'tund beinty stups sdhar'burd. Blu dhoorz.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Mike winced as the engineer's breath steamed into his face. \"We can find our way around.\"\nThe airlock's iris valves rotated open as Mike and Robin approached the outer hatchway. A youngish woman with short, sandy-blonde hair stood in the short passage. Her khaki uniform showed command rank.\n\"Ms. Clay, Mr. Harrison, it's a pleasure to welcome you aboard the Imperial Free Merchant Vista. I'm Captain Quatalis. If you'll follow me, I'll be happy to show you to your cabin. Our other two passengers have not yet arrived. Will you be staying together?\"\nMike and Robin followed the Captain through the airlock's double iris valves and into a hexagonal passage with railings and iron grating floors.\n\"No. What are the accommodations?\"\nThe Captain glanced toward Mike, twisting a red lever which opened a set of sliding doors to a small cargo lift.\n\"Two staterooms, double occupancy.\"\nThe lift descended one level and the doors slid open. Three passages ran to the bow, port, and starboard respectively. The floors and walls were all finished in an artificial, white substance made to look like polished marble, but the metal handrails remained. One was conspicuously bent outward several centimeters.\n\"Bumpy rides?\"\n\"We often get comments on that.\"\nThey followed the captain through the starboard passage and into an oval common area. A wide table occupied the central floorspace, its translucent body suspended from the ceiling by a reflective, holographic projection rod. Gravitic recliner housings lay scattered on the floor around the table like an assemblage of anthills. Nested into the far wall were cupboards, a hydration oven, a squat cooling unit, and two air filters. Sliding, blue doors to either side marked the stateroom entrances.\n\"You'll find the galley down the port passage in case you get hungry. Rrkal, I believe you've met our engineer, he cooks the supper chow at eighteen hours ship time. Otherwise, its fend for yourself. If you need to use medical, that's next to the galley. Rita doubles as our ship's medic; you'll meet her if you get spacesick. If you need anything else use channel zero on the IC. We'll be leaving Tizar in four standard hours, or a little over fifteen cents local time. After we jump into hyperspace we will review your drop-off instructions,\" Captain Quatalis paused with this last thought searching for the right words. \"I hope you enjoy your stay. Good-day.\"\nShe quickly headed down the passage and made a swift right turn away from the lift.\n\"Apparently in a hurry,\" Robin poked her nose into the cupboard.\nMike leaned against the passage railing, \"What drop-off instructions?\"\n\"I think she means we aren't landing at the spaceport. Wanna split a can of mash?\"\nAt T-0:02 Bill and Niki showed up, packed as tightly as two rats could pack. For Niki, that meant a pair of pris glasses, a string of worry beads and the standard med-kit with bandages and casting-foam. Bill carried his own sort of med-kit, three vials of purified ethanol, ten grams of hexobarbital, a laser blade, and one fiberglass body pistol of last resort. Mike never understood how two people so different could get along so well. Getting Bill and Niki together was a recipe for destruction. At formal banquets they could behave, but in a starship galley...\n\"Foodfight!\"\n\"Hey Mike, what's the matter. I thought you liked yogurt.\"\n\"Wanna smoke an enchilada?\"\n\"What the hell is going on here?!\"\n\"Uh..oh.. Ah, hi el cap-i-tan. How beautiful you look this evening.\"\n\"This passenger is drunk!\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"I want to know who the hell brought drugs onboard this vessel!\"\n\"Hic...\"\nMike began to question the wisdom of bringing along an entourage. Niki was essential, just because without her finding Fork would be next to impossible. Robin was part of the deal, which could have been broken back on Tizar. And Bill, with his aptitude and inclination for brawling, was just cannon fodder. Mike smiled, wondering if he would get that far.\n\"Are you aware of the term `depressurization', Mr. Walker?\"\n\"She's gonna space me...\"\n\"Only if you're lucky. And as for you miss Sen...\"\n\"Tee hee hee...\"\nCaptain Quatalis had an interesting method for dealing with drunks. First, they were injected with a nausea inducing compound causing them to sacrifice to the porcelain god the entire contents of their stomaches in addition to several dry heaves just for good measure. Then she had them hooked up to plasma vaccs where they had their blood filtered by the Empire's most sadistic gunner\/medic. Finally, she had them stuffed into low berths for one hour of uninterrupted hibernation, just so they wouldn't miss the hangover. Then, after they were thoroughly sobered, she offered them her sincerest apology for having put them through such stringent disciplinary measures and broke out a bottle of Antares' finest spirit, just to show them how much she meant it. If they accepted, they got to go through the whole process over again.\nMike sat in the corner of medbay taking notes and plenty of pictures for future blackmail. Half way through the proceedings he felt an unmistakable disorientation.\nBill leaned on the plasma filter, pukestance. \"Was that the drug or just me?\"\n\"We just jumped into hyperspace,\" Rita Ghomes examined the readings along the med displays. \"Oh...that's interesting.\"\n\"Sweet mama, Mike, get me the hell outta here.\"\n\"Sorry Bill, captain's orders.\"\n\"Billy...\" Niki curled herself into a little ball around the base of her filter, probably to keep the room from turning so fast.\n\"What is it Niki?\"\n\"I feel woosy.\"\n\"Yeah, that's one way of putting...Mike?\"\nMike looked over at his sobering companion. Bill had plainly noticed something new in his now undrunken state.\n\"Take off the hat, Harrison.\"\nMike obliged him, relishing the surprise of a half-suspended grin. Niki's was less controlled, and evolved from giggles to more puke which nobody thought she possessed.\n\"What the...\"\n\"It's a long story.\"\n\"Them's head-tricks, Mike. Highly illegal for Tizarians.\"\nMike nodded, \"Courtesy of Mr. Clay.\"\n\"In other words, you didn't have any choice.\"\nMike smiled, \"I guess he wants to keep me in line.\"\n\"Or out of line.\"\nNiki looked up from her barf, \"I think it's gross.\"\n\"Look who's talking.\"\n\"Hey, at least I hit the bucket, okay?\"\nMike turned about and left, donning his hat only as an afterthought. The dark passage with its white finish and bent railing seemed to flow over with misplaced memories. He leaned against the metal as if testing its strength. Something about the cold steel put him at ease, as if the time-space bubble which now surrounded the ship would take them somewhere else beside Calanna. Even Telmar was preferable. Or perhaps Tyber. Mike remembered the dense, choking atmosphere, mildly acidic carbons and sulfates eating his lungs as he scrambled for a filter mask, tall smokestacks cutting through the lethal fog a mile and more. Even that would be preferable to Calanna.\nThe oval antechamber to the passenger staterooms was dark and cold. Mike searched the table's surface for environmental controls without success, finally fumbling across the IC.\n\"Hello?\" The voice was strange. A York accent?\n\"Hi. How d'ya turn the lights on?\"\nSuddenly the room lighted up.\nThe person at the other end seemed to laugh, \"I think you found the magic words.\"\n\"Oh. Sorry.\"\n\"Glad to be of assistance.\"\nMike switched the line closed and stumbled into a gravitic recliner beside the table. He wondered who he had just talked to, and how many more \"strangers\" were aboard the Vista.\n\"Computer on.\" Nothing happened.\n\"Quaint...\" Mike leaned over the table and found the switch at the base of the connector. The air above the table began to glow with a luminescent texture as the holo-rod generated a spinning three-dimensional representation of the Vista. Mike paused, waiting for some sort of prompt. The image of the Vista continued rotating.\n\"Hi.\"\n\"Unrecognized command.\"\n\"Help.\"\n\"No help available.\"\nMike went to the cooling unit and returned to his seat empty handed.\n\"Show passengers.\"\n\"Respecify at unrecognized parameter... passengers.\"\n\"Cargo manifest.\"\n\"Records unavailable.\"\n\"Bullshit...\"\n\"Unrecognized command.\"\n\"Show flight instructions.\"\n\"Records unavailable.\"\nMike returned to the cooling unit and grabbed a sluice-stick. He bit off the end and sucked out a quarter of its frozen, syrupy contents.\n\"Who the fuck programmed you?\"\n\"Respecify at unrecognized parameter...the.\"\nMike sat back in the gravitic recliner and let the head tilt back until he rested on a forward incline, his feet sticking upward and out like a gull's tail feathers.\n\"Who...are you?\"\n\"Specify data format.\"\n\"Verbose.\"\n\"Vista, Imperial Free Merchant, SG-64923. Laid down 124-618, Dimstar, Imperial Dimstar Corporation. Tonnage two-hundred standard, twenty-eight hundred cubic meters displacement. Engineering, one Dopel PF-18 fusion-linked power plant driving two Ditar AG-217e hyperfield generators and one Monoquad MQ-3 fixed impulse maneuver drive with dual Zalpha-X turbofan installation. Gravitics, Napaliastics I-14 Field Generators with standard inertial compensation and zero to two gee sustained gravity adjusters. Range, sixteen point three light-years with unlimited maneuver...\"\nMike straightened his posture as the holographic display zoomed-in on specific systems aboard the craft. He tried to keep pace with the output as the computer jumped from one topic to the next. The Vista was a 38-year-old retired scout ship built by Dimstar based on a standard design two-hundred ton hull. It had been purchased at discount by the Bank of Ares and leased through the Galactic Press Corporation as a refitted free merchant. Its entire class had a history of excellent atmospheric maneuverability, but the Vista, in particular, had been placed in dry dock six years previously with orders that it be scrapped due to a series of critical drive failures. Somehow a deal had been cut, and the defective drives had been repaired.\nThe vessel was crewed by two Galactican personnel, two independent contractors, and three robots. The captain, Christine Quatalis, was born on Tyber. She served as a pilot in the Imperial Scouts before being hired on by the Galactican. Her first mate, Victor Darian, was from Ares. He served Sector Navy as a tac-ship lieutenant before being discharged in naval cutbacks three years earlier. Rita Ghomes, a native of Telmar, was discharged around the same time from her planetary guard while the civil unrest was beginning to brew into open revolt. Rrkal, the vargr engineer, was from the outworld coalition. He worked his passage from the frontier aboard a merchant craft until he was laid off near Dimstar. The three robots worked in cargo, maintenance, and engineering respectively, places which passengers were unlikely to ever see.\nThe passenger roster was classified as were flight instructions. Mike guessed that he could have broken the security if he had Cindy on hand or access to the ship's computer directly. An idea itched away somewhere deep inside his mind, but he put it away shaking his head and smiling. If he hadn't seen the way Captain Quatalis dealt with drunks, he might have been more willing to see how she dealt with snoops.\nMike decided he was tired. He peeked down the passage and saw no sign of movement. Niki and Bill were going to spend a few more hours in sick bay for sure. Mike pulled himself to his feet and started toward the closest of the staterooms.\n\"Lights off.\" The door slid open as the room darkened behind him. He shuffled out of his shirt and climbed into where he though the null-tube should be.\n\"Mike?\" It was Robin.\n\"Uh..oh.. I think I stumbled into the wrong room.\"\n\"It's okay. You don't have to go.\"\n\"What makes you think I was going to?\"\nShe didn't bother to come up with a reply but scooted over to make more room. Mike tried to make out her features in the pitch darkness. He wondered what she was wearing.\nIt! It's an android. Mike tried to refocus his thoughts, but they kept twisting around on him.\nShe moved again, \"What are you thinking?\"\n\"Wrong question.\"\n\"You're trying to see me, aren't you.\"\nNot your typical android question, Mike thought. \"Can you see in the dark?\"\nNo answer.\n\"Like, infrared?\" His throat felt dry.\nShe moved again, her head very close to his, but without breath. \"With a dash of the ultraviolet.\" He could almost see her smile.\nMike closed his eyes and tried to sleep wondering why she would do the same. She seemed to mimic humans in almost all aspects of their behavior. Was it simply a part of her programming or something deeper? After several minutes he felt the supressant currents slowly rock as she seemed to breathe, quietly, peacefully. He finally let himself sink slowly beneath the cover of sleep, the depth of space closing inward like a far away dream realized in a sudden instant. And in his mind's eye he saw the fine red outline of a short fence post, its needle-thin barbs pressing outward, seeking blindly in the static wind as a trio of squat, white figures lay aside, their fluffy forms resting on a bed of green haze.\n\"If I wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it.\"\nCaptain Quatalis looked mildly irritated. She chewed on the end of a buttersprout and glanced around the galley looking for her lightpen. Victor sat in the far corner of the room still sizing up her intended audience of four passengers as Rrkal and Rita stirred a can of condensed Terriak hearts into their joint concoction.\nNiki studied the map on the near wall, trying to decipher the gist of the implications. \"What if we get caught?\"\nQuatalis turned to the Siri, \"If we land at the spaceport we'll all be picked up by starlaw, or worse, by ISIS. This is the only alternative.\"\n\"That's only true if the Calannan guard lets the Imps push them around, which is something I find highly unlikely.\"\n\"It's more likely than you might think Mr. Harrison, particularly since Calanna has never been a friend of Tizar or the Galactic Press Corporation.\"\nMike nodded, and reconsidered. The drop-off instructions, drawn by an ex-army commander working directly under Jaden and heading the Tizar office's internal security division, were simple and direct; a clean military troop insertion if Mike had ever seen one. Under the plan, the Vista would jump in at the far side of Calanna's smaller moon, dive into the planet's atmosphere, deal with any resistance as necessary, make the drop via gravchutes, and get out. The only problems were the gravitational effects on the hyperspatial drives, and the resistance, most likely in the form of Wasp fighter craft. After the four were safely dirtside, they should easily ditch the chutes and hide in the local terrain. After that, hiking twenty kilometers into Aelflan, a large agricultural community, would be a snap.\nThe incident would be logged as yet another smuggling operation which made it through. Since many government and security officials took part in such activities themselves on a regular basis, no eyebrows would be raised. The Wasps would probably follow the Vista out at a safe distance and let the few ground personnel available handle the drop. Probability of success: 90% plus, or so it was written. And better still, the Imps would be thinking Harrison and company still on Tizar counting the ashes of poor Mr. Fork.\n\"Fine, but how do we get out.\" It was Niki again.\nQuatalis had wondered when somebody would ask the obvious question. The fact that it had been asked meant that they had already accepted the plan for getting in.\n\"The Vista's cargo shuttle, the Ariya, will land at the spaceport eight days after the drop. We'll unload our cargo and begin speculating. No doubt we'll attract some Imperial attention, so when you try to get back in contact, be subtle. We'll stick around for ten days after that, or until we are no longer needed. The Vista, herself, will be hiding under scanner range of the system's largest gas giant. In case of complications, I suggest you arrange for a backup spacecraft. Are there any questions?\"\nSeeing none, Rrkal announced open season on the supper, and the crew plus one android dug in. Bill poked at the food with the end of his laser blade, watching the mixture fizzle and flame with tempered distaste, and Niki gathered half-a-bowl in a half- hearted attempt to put something down. Mike just sat around watching the others, his appetite all but evaporated by the discussion.\nRrkal grinned at the trio, \"Da Pass'engurz don' eet hartz.\"\nBill looked up from his bowl, an enigmatic smile slowly creeping across his face.\n\"Z'hartz goood foood. Ven Z'Droyd noez.\"\nMike looked across at Robin. She was still shovelling it down with an eager hunger bordering on ravenous.\n\"Zhe eetz like und no tomarwoo.\"\nRobin looked up from the table, gulping down her mouthful without chewing.\n\"Why iz zat, droyd?\"\n\"Because there might not be...\" She looked across at Mike with a matter-of-fact smile. Taken together with the fake sleeping, yawning, detachable ears, and punch in the chest, he decided he didn't like smiling androids, not that he had ever known any others to justify the generalization. Mike reflected on his attitude as she resumed eating.\n\"Doz zhe zhit too?\"\nHer eyebrow cocked at the query, and for the first time Mike felt an inkling of interest in the conversation, such as it was. Bill perked up too, as did the captain after a moment's pause.\n\"Not exactly your usual supper manners, Rrkal.\"\n\"I'm...tirzty.\" He seemed to search for the last word as if unsure of the translation.\nQuatalis regarded him with a passing curiosity. \"You're thirsty? For knowledge?\"\n\"Da.\" The Vargr grinned, two canines dropping from either side of his snout. He seemed rather pleased that he'd gotten his point across, and had all but forgotten about Robin.\nMike looked across the table, \"I don't know; Robin, do you?\"\n\"Do I what?\"\nMike smiled at the slated reply, \"Y'know, 'zhit.\"'\nNiki spilled her bowl as Mike felt a raw reminder of the pain coarse up his spine, snapping each vertebra as it ascended until it loomed at the threshold of his mind. He awaited the burning, but it just stood there like a flickering candle flame, pausing for some sort of twisted invitation.\nMike opened his eyes to see everyone staring at Niki, her face averted in shame as she tried to dry the table. Rrkal slided across and began helping her clean-up as the Captain shuffled out of her recliner to grab a hand-vacc.\n\"Maybe we should have discussed the drop after supper.\"\nBill kept frozen in his place, his eyes sweeping from Niki to Robin, and then over to Mike. As their eyes locked in an understanding that didn't need explanation, Bill reached down to the base of his recliner and switched off, his body slowly rotating into a standing position before the gravitic currents gave way to the surrounding fields. Mike followed suit, and soon found his feet placed firmly on solid decking.\n\"Thanks for the food, but we're not hungry.\"\n\"Daz okay...mor foood fur uz.\"\nMike followed Bill to the hold, the younger man entering an access code at the lift and again at storage. A security camera watched from the corner of the room as Bill hauled one of the gravchutes off the near wall.\n\"Mama says it's best to strike while the enemy is out to lunch.\"\nMike nodded, \"Looks like you've been keeping busy.\"\n\"I figured it was high time I paid my keep.\" Bill took his last vial of ethanol from his back pocket.\n\"She let you keep that?\"\n\"I told her it was for barter...on planet.\"\nMike snatched the vial from Bill's open hand, twisting off its cap as the younger gatherer broke out a two and a half gram capsule.\n\"I wouldn't drink that if I were you, Mike.\"\n\"Not straight.\"\n\"Straight or mixed, you'd die.\" He began opening the chute's gravitics, snipping a thin wire with the end of his knife and fishing it out.\n\"Ethanol?\"\n\"Guess again, Mike.\" His grey eyes seemed to flicker with amusement he tied the thread around the capsule.\n\"I dunno.\"\n\"Well, for starters, it's radioactive. The vial's the shield.\"\nMike handed it back without the cap, \"Fine...you drink it.\"\n\"Not very likely.\" Bill plunged the capsule into the liquid and extended his hand as if for a shake.\n\"This isn't gonna work, Bill.\"\n\"The cap.\"\nMike handed it over, sweat droplets beginning to form on his forehead. \"They're gonna check these things out.\"\n\"Really?\" Bill's eyes widened with pretended surprise.\n\"Really.\"\n\"Don't be a puss, Mike. It'll take at least fifty claps for the current to dissolve the casing.\" Bill produced a foam napkin, wrapping the vial and tying it securely at both ends, the thin wire string falling from its interior. \"And in another twenty... give or take...\" He gritted his teeth as the laser blade burnt the wire back into place.\n\"Then what?\"\nBill closed the unit and replaced the chute back on its rack, nicking its polymer housing almost as an afterthought.\n\"Boom?\"\n\"Neutrinos, Mike. Lots of neutrinos.\"\nThe Vista hung cloaked beneath the shadow of Baal, Calanna's lesser moon, as its port sensors began scanning the cloudy world below. On the distant horizon, the rutilant giant descended into night, saffron rays slipping carelessly away to space.\n\"Passive EMS reports local clear.\"\n\"Focus IR, 3rd Octh, Coord 34.21, 84.13.\" Captain Quatalis cautiously edged the Vista between the jutting walls the dark lunar canyon. An eerie silence crept outside the craft as the joints along her spine began to tingle in anticipation and fear.\n\"How long 'til the batteries...\"\n\"That depends,\" Victor's hand fidgeted over the sensor boon controls while his adjunct talked to the ship's computer and played with the data.\n\"Nothing unusual.\"\n\"Try Neutrino.\"\n\"Already done. Minutes clean.\"\n\"Maybe.\"\nMike sucked in cold air outside the dropshaft, glancing toward the digital altimeter on the far wall. Niki and Bill sat opposite, knees bent upright, boots braced together. Bill wore a worried expression. Niki looked elsewhere, she was ignoring the tension. Mike focused his eyes forward, a cool sweat breaking out along his hairline. Robin gently fingered the straps of her gravchute.\n\"Overweight?\"\n\"Paranoid.\"\nMike smiled at the reply as the vessel jolted sharply against a deafening noise.\n\"Minute's clean! Get me DR and ID!\"\nChristina struggled with the helm controls as the Vista rocked and tumbled with the impact.\n\"They're ground to air. Quiet Snipers.\"\n\"They?\"\n\"Two mark ten.\"\n\"Ghomes, are you reading this!?\"\nThe Vista's hull armor crackled and glowed against the atmospheric friction as the heat seekers scrambled in pursuit. A swarm of plasma cells jettisoned from the aft and exploded in a fiery blaze over fifteen miles high.\n\"Sending pinpoint on source.\"\n\"Fire at will!\"\nThe robot eye scanned skyward, over the grey and dusty clouds, a cumbersome program slowly analyzing the data. Chemical explosion. Plasma release. A small mechanical motor raised the antenna to an upright position as the launcher's comm unit broadcast the coordinates of the hit. Within moments only a burning crater remained.\n\"Okay, give me decoys.\"\n\"Is that neces...\"\n\"Yes!\"\nSix gravballs dropped in pairs from the Vista's ventral aft, dispersing about the vessel as it darted toward the cloud-cover below.\n\"DR Victor.\"\n\"Hull breach in tank seven, jump's out also.\"\n\"Oh, and by the way.\"\nVictor smiled at the criticism, then stopped smiling.\n\"Two wasps, cold fuel. No make that four, in close form pairs. They're mark six. Missile range in twelve.\"\n\"Eyes open Ghomes.\"\n\"Get me fix.\"\n\"Sending...Eight goblins folks.\"\nA single Hellraiser flushed into the inky black as Victor pronounced the \"E\" in \"Eight.\" Within scarce moments a billion cubic yards of sky burst into an intense white flame.\n\"One and two nixed. Three and four are breaking up. Four dupes out.\"\n\"We got lucky.\"\n\"Four more goblins. Mark five and six.\"\nChristina reflexively pulled hard and to starboard as Rita fired an antimissile and loosed a swarm of plasma cells despite the tumbling and turning of the spacecraft. Suddenly the Vista lurched from impact, its steel frame splintering open and erupting from all sides in a fiery inferno of fusion and plasma.\nJim's a grad-student at UC Riverside, hoping and praying like crazy that he'll get his MBA before the dean's axe gets him first.

Darkness loomed above, seeming to descend and collapse closer to earth with each passing moment. Then the sky became as bright as a thousand suns and the darkness was vanquished. Hair caught fire; skin parched, baked, and blackened in the blink of a boiling eye. Then only a single fireball remained, high above, like a sun but lifeless and slowly disintegrating. The sky seemed to crack as the shell of an egg, and a blast ripped through the clouds, shredding the air and deafening all senses as it passed.\nMichael awoke to the pain of burning flesh, the deafening blast seeming like a distant and forgotten dream. The wind tossed him between clouds, scrambling his senses with his emotions. He tasted fear as he saw the ground below and the fireball above. Suddenly, a sharp pain swept through his spine like an ocean wave, sparking memories and stinging his consciousness. He thought he heard Niki giggling somewhere and realized he'd lost his helmet.\nHe looked down again; it was time. He unhooked the release and pressed the activator. The gravchute seemed to yank him upward toward the filthy night sky, now littered with burning debris as the fireball spread outward, dividing into glowing bits of metal and thunder.\nFeet together, knees slightly bent, muscle braced against bone, the old routine flickered in the back of his mind as he hit and rolled, falling uncontrollably into a warm, wet, compost ditch. Botflies circled his head as it emerged from the steaming muck.\nNimble fingers worked free the straps of the shoulder harness and waistbelt, making splish-squish sounds in the lacteal water. The chute slowly sank and disappeared altogether beneath the surface as Mike crawled up the side of the ditch, peeking over the rough earthen edge. The air began to hiss and spit while small chunks of metal ripped into the ground like shrapnel from a grenade. In the distance, some hundred meters, a tall, wire fence, lighted by iridescent lamps, stood proudly, its barbed icing leaning inward, sparking against the hot debris. Mike dug himself into the soft earth as far as he could until his lungs breathed dirt. An explosion rocked the ground, and then another. Several clumps of stone and clay fell into the sludge as Mike felt his fingers grip the roots of some alien weed. The air grew thick and smelled of death and fumes and fire, all mixed together like some unholy beast.\nFor several minutes the sky seemed to fall, and then all was quiet. Mike crawled cautiously from the ditch. Blood trickled down his neck and dripped slowly onto the ground as he stood, haphazardly, holding onto what was left of his face. The skin crackled and fell away without feeling.\nA clean military troop insertion. He tried to smile while there was nobody to see him, but the right side of his mouth was too mangled. He remembered the Vista jolting, the general panic, Bill diving for the drop shaft, himself scrambling with his helmet and pack.\nThere was no sign of his pack anywhere. No infrared goggles, no niko camera, not even a stupid pair of wire cutters. He stared back toward the fence. The distant sound of hooves against dirt met his ears. Mike staggered toward the light of the fence, drawn by the noise of the spooked animals. As he peered into the murky darkness on the other side, he saw several quagga galloping parallel to the posts, their white stripes shining dimly against the cold light.\nIn the distance, he heard the faint whine of chemical combustion engines, probably two-wheelers, motorcycles. This was a ranch. He stared dumbly at the fence. A high-security ranch. Mike walked parallel to the gate, crouching behind the cover of the scrub brush and beyond the range of the light. It was too dark to properly perambulate the area. Patches of snow and ice covered the ground, and the dirt was sturdy but largely barren. The air became steadily colder, and he began to shiver.\nAs he walked, a small spark of light caught his eye. It was on his side, far away from the fence. Bright, yet so small it was hard to distinguish. A flare. Mike crossed though the shallow thicket, dizzied by his loss of blood. He stumbled over a large stone and remembered Robin screaming in mid-air, her gravchute shredded, her body burning, the earth miles below. He heard a dripping noise and tried to concentrate. His hands felt warm and sticky as he regained his footing, but the flare was closer. It stood upright, wedged between two tall rocks on a steep hillside, their sharp edges outlined in the sizzling white light. Mike climbed up the slope, falling to his knees every few meters, his temples pounding with each step, his body shivering from the intense cold.\nHe contemplated falling asleep. He could reach the flare tomorrow or the next day or sometime after that. He tried to imagine waking up later, seeing the flare, its white flame still burning, grasping it in his hand, touching the hot fire. It would tingle his senses, like the waves of the ocean on Tizar, the cool swells lapping effortlessly at the long shore. He would hold the flare in his hand as he slept beneath the starry night sky. He'd sleep forever, and the sun would never rise. Kitara would stay beside him, soothing his dreams as she used to, entering them, sharing her own. Something she had whispered; he could hear her calling his name.\n\"Michael...\"\nDim evening light slipped lazily through the small glass window, coloring the dark, quiet, chamber in shades of purples and greys. In the corner, a rough wooden stool leaned against the wall by the mantle, small burning embers tickling its legs. A black kettle hung suspended above the crackling fire, steam wisping from its nozzle, mixing with the smoke in the chimney. Above the mantle, a dull wooden-handled axe rested against the wall on a set of long iron nails drilled parallel with the floor.\nNiki sat at his bedside, sopping the sweat from his forehead with a cloth napkin. Through one eye, she looked comfortably tired. Mike tried to think of something to say.\n\"Shhh...\"\nHe closed his mouth and let a smile escape. Sharp waves of pain sprinted through his mind.\n\"You'll have to learn to stop that too.\"\n\"What happened?\" The words came out slurred.\n\"You've lost some blood. A mild case of shock. You're lucky I'm a qualified nurse.\"\n\"It was a prerequisite. Where are we?\"\n\"I don't know... but we're safe.\"\n\"What about the others?\"\nMike felt a brush of sorrow after he asked the question. Niki's sorrow.\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"I don't know anymore than you. I've been searching for Billy, but... I just don't know.\" Mike felt the cool, damp cloth caress his forehead as she spoke. Something in her voice said the task was hopeless.\n\"Don't lose faith.\"\n\"I haven't. I'm going to keep searching. But you have to go back to sleep.\"\nMike was too tired to argue. He settled back into the bed and closed his one good eye. It wasn't the first time psionics had saved his life or provided shelter, but the chances of Niki finding Bill were slim. Mike tried to guess likelihood; he couldn't. He wondered who owned the cabin. How long could they stay before the owner's return?\nMike felt the right half of his face. Niki had kept the swelling down, and his mouth was almost completely mended, but she couldn't reconstruct the bones or the teeth. Something had definitely hit him. He couldn't remember what. It ached for him to think about it.\nThe sky was dark when he awoke again, a bowl of hurtleberries on the stool beside him. Her gravchute sat lonesome against the wall. A small pocket in the cabin floor was open. Inside lay a brown leather sack, full of a hodgepodge of useful items. A two- pronged fork, a plate, a rusty distilizer, leaky chemical batteries, a wishbone, a long, thin vial, a pot and serving spoon, a box of matches, a ceramic mug. Mike regarded them curiously.\nOutside the cabin, Niki sat crosslegged, facing the forest, deep in meditation, her slight body framed by the predawn light. The forest surrounded the cabin on all sides without leaving so much room for a clearing. A thick, green tarp covered the entire roof, a small hole cut out for the chimney, and, above that, the long, weeping branches of a dwearmurgrove tree hung limp in the cold air. The chimney ended in a dun colored box, black cords falling from underneath its corners and into the tarp's heavy fabric.\nMike guessed the whole mechanism was some sort of makeshift insulation to detract from the IR image. Somebody had gone to a good deal of trouble to build this hideaway. He wondered how Niki had found it and how she had managed to drag him through the dense brush without leaving a conspicuous trail. The memory of a lonely gravchute formed in his mind, it's dull grey exterior blending into the darkness as it sat, propped, against a cabin wall.\nNiki opened her eyes, \"Lots of juice in those puppies.\"\nMike looked up, startled.\n\"Sorry.\"\nHe churned up a staid expression. \"You're getting good. Were you just reading me or searching for Bill at all?\"\n\"I said I was sorry.\" She seemed to fold inward on herself, trying to become small and unnoticed, clutching to her string of beads like a security blanket. Mike kneeled down, testing his flexibility after a day in bed.\n\"Speaking of juice, I'm thirsty. Where's the stream?\"\nShe reached into her cloth knapsack and retrieved a shiny aluminum canteen. Mike drank.\n\"There's a stream about a kilometer north. Over the hill beyond that is where we came down.\"\n\"What have you got in here? Gyrocompass, good. Medscanner, castfoam, pris glasses, synthetic gloves; aha, mullah. You've been holding out on me, Niki.\"\n\"Mike?\"\n\"Cold, hard imperial cash. Highly illegal at the moment, but considering the state of the drin, it ought to be good for barter. How much is this... y'know you're practically destitute, Niki?\"\n\"Sorry, my boss doesn't pay me what I'm worth.\"\nMike looked into her eyes and smiled as much as his new facial structure would allow.\n\"Oh he doesn't, does he?\"\n\"Billy's alive, boss.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"I'm not sure yet, but we gotta start looking.\"\nMike stretched his arms and yawned, \"Hold that thought.\" He stepped into the treeline, backing within a clump of foliage.\n\"What's my Mike doing?\"\n\"`Mike-turating,' lemme lone.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Answering the call of Mother Nature.\"\n\"Humph... well lemme tell you about Father Time,\" Niki picked out a flat stone and sent it ricocheting off a nearby branch.\n\"Hey!\"\n\"Now stop rubbing your frowzy face and get back here!\"\nThe two angry men dunked his head into the murky water, thrusting it deeper than before, holding it longer until he reflexively opened his mouth to breathe. He felt himself being yanked back to the surface, coughing, wheezing, sputtering for air, his guts surging upward to his mouth, the stank of the urine and feces weakening his cuffed limbs from nausea. A brown offal bobbed on the surface, seeming to laugh with every motion.\nThe white-shirted man stood opposite him, a thin smile playing across his lips. \"You approve of our sewage containment system? I give you my assurance that you will have plenty of time to inspect it closely unless you begin talking now.\"\n\"No speak.\"\n\"You are a stinking liar.\"\nBill caught a lung full of air as his head submerged beneath the filthy muck. The two men lifted his legs above his upper torso and pushed them down into the refuse until his head hit bottom, dung and piss spilling along the barrel's rusty sides. After a minute, his body began to twist violently, convulsing for lack of air. The guards looked up with doleful eyes.\n\"Not just yet. Our friend is thirsty; we must let him drink his fill.\"\nSoon, his feet slowed down, stopped kicking, and finally hung limp. The guards pulled his dripping, corpselike body from the slimy excrement, holding him upright off the ground. The white-shirted man walked over and patted Bill on the cheek.\n\"Yes. I think you will like it here.\"\nBill opened his bloodshot eyes and sprayed the man's face with a mouthful of sludge, spitting the last of the staining refuse onto the man's white shirt. Seizing the moment, his cuffed legs kicked upward as if by their own volition, striking their target at full force as the man's jaw dropped in horror and pain. Bill watched in satisfaction as the man fell to the littered floor gripping his groin tightly with both hands.\nAfter several deep breaths, the man looked up into Walker's steely grey eyes. \"You're dead.\"\n\"Now, now Sheffy,\" a ringing voice from the far end of the room cheerfully chirped, \"the boy can't help it. He obviously doesn't speak our language.\"\nBill saw an elderly woman step into the dim light from the darkness of a corner. She wore a black, levantine dress with long leather gloves and boots, and her silvery hair was clipped with a furl.\n\"He's lying, mother.\"\n\"Really dear, I think it's time you were off to bed.\"\n\"Stop patronizing me!\"\nShe stopped in her tracks and cast her son a sharp glance, her sharp blue eyes seeming to sting him from a distance. The man tried to stand, but stumbled over his own legs in agony. She regarded him callously, like a vulture might regard a dying carcass. His eyes glazed over in trepidation as he noted her gaze.\n\"I mean,\" the quiver in his voice was laced with fear, \"yes... mother. I'm going to bed now.\" He seemed to force the last words out one at a time. One of the guards helped him to his feet and out of the room. Bill gauged his chances against the other as the woman approached him, carefully sidestepping the scattered droppings and puddles of urine.\n\"Whew... you smell terrible.\"\n\"No speak.\"\n\"Though not as bad as Sheff smelled after he cornered that zorille last year. You remember that, don't you Medwin?\"\n\"Yes, Madre.\"\n\"Ambrose thought our boy was ready for some hunting.\"\n\"No speak.\"\n\"No, no that's quite all right. I don't prize my young men for their vocabularies. What I'll do with you is report you to the authorities. In fact, I'll have to report this whole mess. Then we'll have to scour the countryside for your friends. You didn't come alone, did you.\"\nBill shut his eyes and tried not to listen.\n\"Then the Imps will come in, if my appraisal is worth beans. That's bad news. The Imps don't much cotton to sticky messes, which is what you're in right now. I think you'd rather work in a labor camp or as a slave in some rotting hole in the ground than have your brain erased. They do that nowadays, you know...with interstellar criminals.\"\n\"No speak.\"\n\"No you won't speak, and it's too bad. If you only spoke you could save your life, your friends lives. It's a crying shame, I think. But pipe beatings and dung drownings obviously won't cure your affliction.\"\nBill found himself pondering her words.\n\"The authorities will have drugs which will make you talk, and the Imps will have methods which are better left undiscussed in polite company.\"\nShe shifted her feet around another puddle and stepped in front of Bill, casually waving off a tiny gnat.\n\"There will be people here in the morning. Will they be looking for you? What should I tell them? What reason do I have to save your ass if you won't talk?\"\nBill could feel his breath quicken. Her sharp blue eyes scintillated in the dim light, driving imaginary needles into his own as the gnat spun wildly in the air, plunging recklessly into the rusty rimmed barrel and the thick gooey soup within.\nGall midges buzzed under the trees around the shallow stream as the early sunlight spiked down between the branches like razored knives. Mike decided that Niki must have made a bee-line for the cabin after she found him; psionics didn't account for ease of travel. He chopped brush out of the way, and made a neater trail than the one she had sniffed out. The long-handled axe was somewhat dull, but it did the job all the same.\nIt was the axe, she said, that had led her to the cabin. Psionically, it was like a beacon, a conspicuous aberration in an otherwise unlikely background, full of strong emotions and pain. She thought of calling for help at the ranch instead, but there was pain there as well, and enough angry people to blow their mission. There would probably be government people, as well, asking questions, trying to find out what happened, maybe even Imperials.\nMike tried to collate the data. The explosion still throbbed inside his memory blocking out the usual clutter. The drop never took into consideration a strong defense. Calanna wasn't known for tight planetary defenses. If anything, the opposite was true. It was almost as if they had been expected.\nThe hilltop was studded with dandelions sprouting forth from the hard terrain. Niki spied the landscape through the pris glasses. To the north, another kilometer almost, Mike saw the tall wire fence gleaming in the morning sunlight. A kilometer further was a ranch house and a tall guardtower jutting upward from the grassy fields.\n\"To count the sheep?\"\n\"Gimmie dat.\"\nNiki handed over the glasses. Mike adjusted the power and zoomed in, chainlocking until he could see the sun sparkling off their shades.\n\"Thems is autorifles. Lucy issue. Serial number...\"\nNiki snatched the glasses back, \"No poop; lemme see.\"\n\"Yes poop. Can that thing take pictures?\"\n\"Nope.\" She winced though the lenses, the internal flywheel gyroscopically stabilizing the image. \"You can't see the serial numbers.\"\n\"But it was fun pretending; gimmie back.\" Mike counted about twenty guards in all. The prisoners numbered at least a hundred, most working the fields with hoes and picks. One tractor sat idle underneath a canopy tent beside a row of stables, its mechanical guts strewn over the ground like so many spare organs. Two kilometers east of the house was a crater a good fifty meters in diameter. Big enough to cause a scare, he figured. Some prisoners and guards were there, sifting through the wreckage.\n\"What's the matter. Wha'd'ya see?\"\nMike handed the glasses back to her, \"Take a peek at this.\"\nA smile crossed her lips, a momentary rupture of glee. \"He is alive.\"\n\"And well, though incarcerated. Typical.\"\nHe felt the expected rabbit punch to his kidney as the clapping of copter blades echoed on the wind.\n\"Now the question is...\"\nShe lowered the glasses to complete his thought, \"How do we get him out?\"\nThe black copter circled around the ranch house slowly, spying the guardtower and the stables and the tractor under the canopy tent. The morning sunlight glimmered off its dark surface, its guns gleaming like polished spears.\nThe old woman glanced out her office window, \"What the hell are they doing back so early?\"\nThe men in the fields stopped their work, and those in the distant crater climbed out and watched the vessel settle down beside Madre's garden. Bill picked his teeth with a splinter of hull metal.\n\"Those the Imps?\"\n\"Come to pay us visits,\" Sheff's blue eyes gleamed in the sunlight as he smiled and shoved Bill backward. \"Back to work, neghral.\"\nBill had learned that the last word translated roughly as \"alien\" in the planetary lingo, stressing the negative connotations. The Calannans didn't like offworlders; most dirtsiders didn't.\nTwo figures emerged from the copter's cockpit, one dressed in a white, loose fitting wrapper, the other wearing a khaki uniform, sporting a kepi atop his shiny, bald head. The old woman strolled out to greet them, an air of confidence and composure close about her.\n\"Colonel Arman, what a pleasant surprise. And I see you've brought our guest. Sule, wasn't it?\"\n\"That is correct.\" The bald headed colonel bowed slightly, his thick Calannan accent drooling over the Galanglic as he chuckled nervously. The offworlder stepped in front of him wearing a determined smile, her long white hair flowing free with the warm breeze like a quagga's mane.\n\"I am still looking.\" She seemed to spit the words, harshly.\n\"Congratulations,\" the old woman beamed back.\n\"Madre, please.\" The colonel mopped beads of perspiration from his crinkled forehead with a brown cloth. He seemed to her more embarrassed than annoyed as a sharp gust swiped at the visor of his hat. She ached to pity him.\n\"Why don't you both come inside. I'll make us some tea. Do you drink tea Sule?\"\nGusts of wind swept up loose dirt, stinging the prisoners in the field. Bill hustled into the crater for protection, scowling at the suddenly harsh wind.\nThe living room was plush by local standards, tiled in white marble with dark red streaks, elegantly furnished with the forest's finest. A large table occupied the floor's center, before the hearth. Its stout wooden legs, smoldered black at their base, were shaped as the paws of a lion. Sparks danced carelessly along the floor, seeming to conduct the crackling fire as the old woman poured the hot tea from a white china kettle, her long thin fingers stiffened with age.\n\"Me and my boys often break fast here, around this table. Greenleaf tea for everyone, that's what we have.\"\nThe colonel sipped the home brew, his pudgy fingers wrapped around his small bowl for security. She remembered him as a little boy, always curious and kind. His curiosity had been long chased away.\n\"The hospitable reputation of Madre is well deserved,\" he explained, his deep voice cutting through the air. \"Not only she care for her boys, but she also take strangers. Is not that right Madre?\"\n\"That all depends on how strange they are. More tea?\"\nSule stroked her chin in thought, \"Tell her about the tracks.\" Madre pondered the richness of her voice, not dark and crusty like the colonel's, but somehow different.\n\"Ah yes, the tracks,\" the colonel tried to search for the words. The interstellar verse was not easy for him. \"We find the tracks of a person near the farrest gate. Much blood. It end on a small hillock south of here.\"\nSo he has a friend. The old woman nodded gently, anticipating his train of thought, \"And you think I opened my house to this individual?\"\nThe colonel smiled, a flush of pink entering his dark brown cheeks. She glanced toward Sule; the young woman stared solidly back, her bright blue eyes matching the sky at highsun.\n\"What did this individual do?\"\nThe colonel's smile broke into a deep resonant laugh, \"Then you admit.\"\nMadre shook her head, \"Admit? No. I never said that. I'm simply curious.\"\nSule stood up from her chair and walked toward the old woman, \"You do understand that harboring a criminal is a felony under Imperial statute?\" Her voice was too raspy for a girl, and something about her walk suggested aggression.\n\"I understand that you are looking for someone. Has this person committed some offense?\"\nSule's voice hissed and slithered like something diabolical, \"You are not in a position to question me.\"\n\"While you are in my house I'll question you whenever I damn well please.\" The old woman waited for a retort, for a scowl, a blush, some sign of weakness or strength. Sule's reply was silent composure. Suddenly she realized what she'd been thinking all along.\n\"What are you? You're not a woman...\"\nSule smiled at the remark.\n\"...and you aren't a man either. Are you an android?\" Her question touched a spark.\n\"Do androids interest you, madre?\"\n\"No, I think they're quite disgusting actually, machines parading around as people. I say the lot should be rounded up and roasted on the spit, Lucy style, along with their makers.\"\nSule perched herself on the table edge, \"Isn't it a revolting notion? Microcircuits for brains, complex algorithms to mimic sentience, to pretend emotions. An absolutely horrific science.\"\n\"You seem at odds with yourself, child.\"\n\"I'm not an android any more than you are.\"\n\"Then what are you?\"\nSule chewed on the query, her eyes darting to the stone hearth and the dying embers within. She slipped gracefully beside the fire reaching inside to pick out a glowing red coal.\n\"I am biological,\" her words now sarcastically melodious as she returned to the table, \"yet I do not roast so easily. Do you?\" Her hand wavered in front of the old woman's face, her sky blue eyes seeming maliciously playful against the dimming red of the coal.\n\"Is that supposed to be some sort of frail threat?\"\n\"Just call it a forecast of your imminent future if you continue to refuse to cooperate.\"\n\"I'm qui...\"\n\"Mother!\" Sule's hand closed into a fist around the coal as Sheff crossed the tiled threshold into the dining room, puffing wearily for breath. Cupped in his hands he held a blackened, metallic object, about the size of a grapefruit. Bill was close behind, his frail body seeming less fatigued by the sprint. His grey eyes glinted with a strange mixture of curiosity and apprehension.\n\"Mother, look what I've found!\"\n\"You found?\" Bill started, but Sheff hurriedly bowed before the two guests, ignoring the remark. He proudly displayed his trophy in one hand. The object was a dodecahedron, somewhat scathed from its fall yet still intact. Engraved on one triangular face was the distinct picture of a small songbird with its wings outstretched as if in flight.\n\"I don't care who found it. Just what is it?\"\n\"It's an alien artifact,\" he retorted, his free hand sweeping backward into Bill's face.\n\"Ah, so it is. My boys never cease to amaze me with their brilliant powers of deduction. Oh, by the way, this is Sheffy; he likes to be called Sheff. And this one here is Vilo, but you can call him anything you like, or hate for that matter, not that it matters, because it doesn't unless you make it.\"\n\"Mother?\"\n\"Sheffy, I will not put up with your rude interruptions.\"\n\"But the artif...\"\n\"Now that you're here you can make yourself useful. Wash these dishes. Vilo, show our guests out, they were just leaving.\"\nColonel Arman stood abruptly from his chair and began to leave, waiving his apology to the Madre. Bill found himself grabbing Sule's arm without effect. When he tugged, it was like trying to pull a mountain. She snatched the dodecahedron from Sheff's hands as he collected the tea bowls, running her long fingers across the shiny engraving.\n\"You really have these jerks by their nuggets. Especially grey-eyes. Don't you know how to treat a lady?\"\nBill instinctively pulled his hand away as he heard her voice, its raspy edge hissing along the hollow between his shoulder blades. It was somehow a dichotomy between cultured refinement and animal barbarism. The old woman smiled at his response.\n\"Don't mind her boy, she's biological.\"\n\"That doesn't mean I won't sting.\" Sule flicked the coal into his face, leaving a red, burned spot where it nicked his cheek. Bill wanted to shove her head into the hearth, but thought better of it when he noticed the daring smile playing across her lips.\n\"She's tempting you boy, trying to deny the facts of life.\" Madre walked toward her, gently guiding Bill aside with her free hand. \"Sule, the facts are that you are being forcibly evicted from the premises; your only choice is with respect to the method of transport. You can either walk out or be carried out in pieces. I don't care which.\"\n\"I'll go, but I'm taking this.\" She held the dodecahedron firmly in her palm, testing its weight.\n\"The hell you are.\"\n\"It's from space, unclaimed. That makes it Imperial property.\"\n\"It was found on my land and it's mine.\"\n\"And what would you do with it?\"\n\"It doesn't matter if I'd make ducks and drakes of it; I still say it's mine. Now put it down or I'll have you shot.\"\nSule smiled, perching the object on three fingers. \"So it is yours for now. Let us see how long you can keep it.\" She tossed the dodecahedron into the fire, crushing the burning sticks under its weight. Flames enveloped it as Sheff ran to the kitchen for water.\n\"Good day, Madre.\" Her tall boots clicked on the tile floor as she left, leaving the stain of their echo on the pungent morning air.\n\"Vilo, see that they make it to their vehicle.\"\nSheff scurried back into the dining room with a pail of water which he threw on the fire. The flames sputtered and drowned instantly. He reached into the steaming embers and withdrew the dark object.\n\"Mother, that girl is a bitch with an attitude.\"\n\"She's no girl.\"\nHe dropped his prize into the bucket with a sound metallic plunk.\n\"Why'd you let her go?\"\n\"Colonel Arman.\"\n\"Arman's no friend of neghrali.\"\nThe old woman finished sipping her tea as the sound of chopper blades clicked off the windows.\n\"He's a friend of mine.\"\nSheff sighed, \"Mother getting sentimental in her senility?\"\n\"Watch that.\"\nSheff took the bowl, \"I could have softened her up.\"\n\"Like you softened up Vilo or whatever his real name is? I don't think so. I gave him to you for fifty cents. Your methods produced nothing. I talk to him for fifty claps and he's blabbering so much I need an extra set of ears just to keep up.\"\nBill strolled into the room wearing a quizzical smile, \"I hope I wasn't that easy.\"\n\"My poor boy, being easy is a blessing on Calanna. Nobody admires people who are difficult. Now come give your mother a kiss.\"\nBill leaned over and pecked her on the cheek, \"You're a sweet mama.\"\n\"I know I am. Now get back to work before I see fit to have you slaughtered.\"\n\"Yes, Madre.\"\nBill headed outside into the crisp breeze. As he walked toward the crater he watched the black chopper shrinking slowly over the distant horizon, its shiny surface reflecting the growing star's light. Within the house, another pair of eyes followed its descent into the skyline.\n\"He's trouble, mother.\"\nShe frowned at the comment.\n\"He'll bring the Imps upon us. And for what? His lies?\"\n\"I only hope they are lies...\"\nSheff considered her reply with a questioning glance, \"What did he tell you?\"\n\"Enough to keep me entertained.\"\n\"He's a neghral, mother.\"\n\"Not anymore, Sheff. He's one of my boys now, and I'll not give him away to the likes of Sule.\"\nSheff laughed at the statement, anticipating her icy stare without fear.\n\"And just what's so funny?\"\n\"He's not yours until he's ours.\"\n\"Sheffy...\"\n\"I've got to insist, mother. It is tradition after all.\"\nShe weighed his demand against the harm it could inflict, and decided the latter a lighter sum. It was, after all, tradition.\n\"Tonight, mother.\"\n\"So be it.\"\nMadre turned the time-glass over with as much indifference as she could feign, the steely grains tumbling through its neck like the falling sleet as Bill watched the eight advance around him with an almost orchestrated precision. Sheff closed the distance first, grinning wickedly as he leapt forward into an outstretched leg. Bill slammed the foreman's head into his rising knee, the squeaky crack of a splintered jaw dividing the cheers into opposing camps.\nThe feeling of triumph lasted about two seconds as his legs swept suddenly from the earth, the wet earth rising in a hateful alliance with his enemies. Bill braced the fall with a forearm and rolled with the momentum, rising to his feet and, seconds later, ducking a roundhouse as the circle fragmented and the crowd pressed forward. Instinct tried to take form in his legs, but there was nowhere to run. On every side, guards held fully automatic rifles, five facing inward as the rest held the crowd at bay. Bill broke into the rim as several barrels homed in on his body. The closest guard thrust a stock into his back, pushing him into the ring as two others forced him to his knees.\nHe twisted his head sideways, avoiding the brunt of an oncoming boot, and felt his elbow spike into a sloppily defended neck as his fist punched upward into another's crotch. The crowd cheered again but was muffled by the noise of gunfire. Bill spat mud as he rolled back to the rim, desperately trying to regain some footing in the slippery dirt before the ground came crashing back upward, spinning as it impacted and smothered.\nBill felt a rib crack from his tackler's blow, breath fleeing his lungs on its own volition as the man's arms yanked his body upward, the now familiar earth receding from his legs as he kicked wildly into another. The change in momentum, forced his companion into a backward fall with a satisfying crunch, the arms which had lifted him, falling to either side as he rolled from the circle's center and regained his footing at the opposing side.\n\"You son of a...\"\nThe haymaker was too obvious to deserve a block. Bill sidestepped the fist, turning his motion into a backward elbow cut, followed by a second. The farm boy slumped to the ground as two others approached. The crowd roared, and someone threw a burning flask of petro into the circle, the glass shards erupting into an expanding ball of flame. Bill crouched into the sticky dirt as gunfire filled the air, the crowd falling back as his attackers rolled in the mud, desperately extinguishing their burning clothes. He didn't realize the mistake until he was tackled from the side, his already broken rib giving to another as his face hit a stone.\nBill's nose flattened as Sheff pounded the young gatherer's head a second time, blood sluicing out the nostrils like a waterfall. Time slowed to a halt as the crackle of fire and automatic rifles became one; Sheff, trying to say something out of the corner of his mouth, his upper lip split through the middle like a pair of outstretched wings, and a carpet of flame spreading overhead. Sheff seemed to laugh as his skull connected with the ground, wheels of time resuming their motion as Bill found his arm limply tangled around the foreman's neck.\nThe gunfire ceased as the guards fell back into the circle's center, flames evaporating beneath the foamy spray of chemical extinguishers. Bill felt himself lifted off the ground and carried to the front of the house, the top of the timeglass now empty except for the refraction of the dying firelight. Madre was gone, and her bodyguards with her. Bill scanned the windows and noticed motion from the balcony as three guards in riot gear, weapons blasting, forced their passage into the clearing.\n\"Confukingratulations, Vilo!\"\nThe largest of their number slammed him to the ground with a sturdy nightstick, belting him over the shoulders until he agreed to remain still. The second revealed a branding syringe from its cylindrical casing, stabbing the needle end deep into the small of his left knee. The ensuing howl of recognition did little to relieve the pain. The guards lifted him to his feet and turned him back toward the crowd, icy hands hoisting him skyward like some enfeebled lark as the Madre watched from the safety of her balcony.\n\"You're one of us, now, Vilo...\"\n\"Hey Madre, he's done!\"\nShe held the tracer in one hand, adjusting its dials with the other and finally glancing back downward with approval.\n\"She sees you, man.\"\nThey carried him into the stables, each singing with unfounded joy. His leg throbbed and buckled as they set him down, their bodies rocking with laughter as he tried to walk.\n\"Takes time, Vilo.\"\n\"Tu saadras... c'mon!\"\nBill stumbled forward, forcing himself back to his feet. The knee threatened to explode as he tested more weight.\n\"That's it...\"\nHe fell forward again, bracing his fall with outstretched arms.\n\"What you need... is a good kick in the face.\" Sheff's words came out slurred, and Bill heard more laughter as his skull snapped backward with the force of the blow. A warm, mushy feeling swept over him, holding him down as he tried to fight for air. The second kick was lower and far more painful. Voices blurred together in the background as the white ice filled his mind, numbing his senses as he passed out.\n\"Hey man, that's cold.\"\n\"Payback, Rone. Just payback.\"\nThe cold, black night betrayed the scattered silence of a waiting tempest. Occasional droplets fell from the heavens, freezing together as solid pebbles in their descent. The pitter patter of their bodies striking branches and leaves, mixed with the distant roar of a shallow creek, cascading gently over smoothed stones and the occasional rustle of a bitter, darktime breeze among the tall wicks of the lodgepole pines. Ambrose crept quietly through the dense thicket, his eyes darting back and forth as he moved beside the cabin, the pungent odor of burning wood chips bringing his body to a crouch and then a slither. From the corner of his vision he caught the flicker, something ugly in the playful flame telling him to turn away, but his cabin stood as solid as he had remembered, and the warmth of its hearth beckoned as the light hail began to quicken.\n\"If I knew that, we wouldn't still be here.\" Mike rubbed the brittle outgrowth of stubble on his scalp, the metal prongs still coming as a surprise. Niki pulled her knees against her chest, her dark eyes still focused on the axe at the hearth.\n\"I don't like this place, Mike.\"\n\"What's so bad about it?\"\nShe shook her head, somehow unable to clarify her feelings.\n\"You're getting too good at that.\"\n\"We don't belong here... and...\"\nMike shrugged off the statement, \"Of course we don't belong here. We don't even belong on this planet.\"\nHe leaned over her lithe form, closing the window as flakes of hail bounced off its glass pains. She turned her head away as he paused to put a hand on her shoulder, the wet hush of confusion and shame forming within her eyes, refusing almost to acknowledge his presence.\nMike breathed a heavy sigh, \"Niki, we're gonna find Bill.\"\n\"I know,\" but her eyes looked away. \"It's not that.\"\n\"Then what is it?\"\nHer eyes fell again upon the axe, its dull metal stinging her psyche like a mega-watt lamp. Mike stepped to the hearth and gathered the wooden shaft in his hands, weighing it in his mind as a weapon. Niki said the pain it generated was a beacon to the cabin, but, for some reason even she could not explain, the pain only grew. It was as if their arrival sparked its aura, the axe somehow expecting.\nAmbrose lifted his boot with a frown as pellets of ice pegged him in the back of the head. It had taken the better part of an afternoon to carve the door and set it on its frame. \"Oh, what the hell,\" he mused with a smile, \"doors be fixed.\"\nThe wooden portal splintered off its hinges as it fell, the shock nearly causing Mike to drop the flat of the blade on his foot. An old man entered the cabin, wild blue eyes bulging from their sockets as he waved his rifle between Niki and Mike, deciding who to shoot first. His grizzly beard and shaggy, grey mane dripped water onto a drab overcoat as droplets of slush fell onto the backs of his boots, coalescing into a pool at his feet. Suddenly, a smile crossed his face as his eyes began to settle back in their sockets.\n\"You gone take a chop at me sonny, or do I have to blow your stupi' face off?\"\nMike dropped the axe to the floor as the gnarled figure trained his rifle between the gatherer's eyes.\n\"We mean you no harm,\" he offered in his best Calannic, which he knew wasn't anything to brag about. The old man seemed to notice his trouble and switched to the Galanglic verse.\n\"You damn right 'bout dat, son. Hell, ya can barely talk straight. Now slide dat axe over here an have a seat. Psyche... hey psyche for brains, make me some hot water or I'm gonna blow yer boyfrien' inna sushi stew.\"\nMike let the old man cuff his hands as Niki drew the water and set the kettle over the fire. Ambrose sat down on the bed placing the end of his barrel against Mike's forehead.\n\"Heh... heh... sushi stew... yum yum...\"\n\"What do you want from us?\"\n\"Who told ya iz okay ta speak?!\" His eyes grew large and wild, the blue and white seeming to strain apart like the surf and foam of the sea on Tizar. \"Huh... chip-head! Answer me!\"\nMike felt the nuzzle of the barrel punch against his forehead.\n\"We were just staying the night here.\"\n\"Staying the night? You say you were staying the night?\" His eyes seemed to soften their glare as the barrel dropped to Mike's chest, his tongue taking more care to enunciate the interstellar words. \"Hell... you can stay all da nights you want... or days fer that matter. I put you outside, in my cemetery, like I do all da others and you can stay long as you like.\" He nodded his head as if remembering something he'd forgotten, then turned one eye on the kettle as it began to steam, the other cocked directly at Mike. \"Psyche... what'cha doin'bout my wata!\"\nNiki filled the mug and brought it over, a thin steam rising from the water as she held it before him.\n\"No woman... not like dat.\" He opened his drab coat with one hand and reached into a pocket, struggling against the fabric until he finally fished out a small leather pouch. \"Just a spoon now. Madre's finest cinnamon,\" he explained in a whisper as if there were other people all around. \"Nothin' burns the blood warmer dan dat, 'cept if its got a tad o' spunk for starters. Which it has, o' course.\" He fished again and produced a small metal flask. \"A wee bit mo dan a spoon of dis,\" his other eye winking at Mike as she poured. \"Ta steady ma aim. Can't be making a mess in ma own cabin, now.\" He drank down half and offered the rest to Mike. \"Consider it in lieu of a las cigar.\"\n\"I don't smoke.\"\n\"All da mo reason.\"\nMike considered the logic for all of two seconds before tilting his head back and letting the old man pour the last half down his throat. The liquid would have carried a healthy flavor if not for the heat scorching his taste buds and flesh of his throat. Mike forced the last drop down, finally coughing at the end as the man laughed and slapped his knee.\n\"Not bad... not bad at all. You would've made a fine fool when I was a younger.\"\n\"It's not to late for that,\" Niki took the cup back and headed for the kettle. Mike regarded her comment with as much good humor as he could muster, a twinkle entering the old man's blue eyes as he watched her refill the mug.\n\"Another, or should we get it over wit?\"\nMike nodded in favor of the former, hoping to extend his life a few moments longer. The man smiled, understanding the laconic reply for all it was worth.\n\"Ma name's Ambrose.\"\n\"Mike.\"\n\"Nikita.\" Niki handed him the mug.\n\"Well... now dat we know each other's names, les drink.\"\nThe night dragged on for many more mug-fulls of Madre's cinnamon and spunk, a hazy cloud thrashing down on Mike's senses as he lost count. The man had Niki drink too, and soon began drawing the water himself as she collapsed on the floor in a giggling fit. Mike didn't remember when he became aware of the gun sitting in the corner. The oiled barrel gleamed in the weak, shifting light of the fire's dying embers.\n\"C'mon foolson. You an' me play a game. You get to da gun before me, an' you can kill me.\" His wild blue eyes seemed to roll clockwise with the thought. \"Ha! I die. Go fer it. You can e'en have da first step. Two steps. Two steps lead.\" Something about Ambrose's invitation told Mike to take the chance, as if the length of his life depended on some see-saw estimation in the old man's twisted mind. Mike felt his feet stumble across the slippery floor as he reached the corner, but the gun was no longer there. The man laughed and aimed the barrel with one arm, gingerly drinking from his mug with the other. \"You lose!\"\nMike felt his heart sink as the lonely wail of clouded memories began coursing into his mind, their withered bodies pushing wildly through the cold, steel barrel of Ambrose's rifle. For the barest moment, light burst from its void, outlining a silhouette in crisp streaks of icy brilliance. In the back of his brain Mike heard the distant explosion. Gardansa said it was an easy death, more than any psyche deserved. The old man's eyes sunk backward, the blue like a crisp winter sky, the white a frosty droplet falling ever faster, slapping eagerly against the wooden door and then jumping again like a lazy bird, breaking apart into blood and shattered bone, colliding with its brethren, falling into puddles, puddles forming rivulets, coursing together around rocks and mounds in a mad rush for muddy harmony.\nAnd then only darkness, pitch upon black.\n\"You gonna shoot me?\"\nAmbrose blinked, \"It's getting to be quite a storm out there. Proly go to sunrise, at least.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nMike heard the rattling of sharp, green, dwearmurgrove leaves against a soft tapestry of color; blues, grays, and amber intermixed between gentle shades of purple and violet.\n\"You wanna play again?\"\nMike considered what the sun might look like, if morning came. Maybe, if he won, he would see it, and know.\n\"Three steps lead... think you can beat me chiphead?\"\n\"I dunno.\"\n\"C'mon then an' find out.\"\nMike waited for Ambrose to replace the rifle in the corner and walk back to the bed, his tired legs stepping gingerly over the soggy door. Mike dove forward without warning, scrambling for the gun as Ambrose climbed over him. They grabbed the gun in unison, a grin of pleasure coming to Mike's face until he realized he was holding onto the wrong end. He pulled with all his strength, trying to twist the weapon from the old man's grip, but Ambrose grabbed the whiskbroom and in a resourceful moment dusted off Mike's lingering smile.\n\"Haha! You lose 'gain! Ambro too fast fer the chiphead!\"\n\"I'm not a chiphead.\"\n\"Den why're you jacked up, foolson?!\"\nMike tried to explain, but his words didn't make much sense even to his own ears. He finally fell backwards over Niki's sleeping form.\n\"Hey... chiphead. What're you doin'. Leave 'er lone.\"\nMike pulled her feet onto the bed, and then let them fall as he reached for her shoulders, her lithe body seeming unreasonably heavy. Somewhere in the background he heard the old man laughing. Mike tried to remember the name as he worked her shoulders up and then moved to her feet as the young Siri's head plopped again to the floor.\n\"What're you doin'?\"\n\"Gotta put her... on the bed.\" Mike moved back to her feet.\n\"Hey chiphead, don't you got more important things to worry about?\"\nMike focused his eyes back on the gun. He struggled to pull Niki by her legs, finally falling on the bed as a blanket slipped out from under his knees. Ambrose knelt to the floor, gripping his sides with glee.\n\"You could help, y'know.\"\n\"Hee hee... Aw, chiphead... you's real funny.\"\nMike tried to see the humor in the situation. He knelt down to her arms and tried pulling her up, losing his balance halfway through the procedure and falling back to the floor. Ambrose set his gun back in the corner and helped Mike back onto his feet.\n\"I can't take anymore of this... I'll help but then you gotta play me again.\"\nMike shrugged off the old man's arm, \"I'm tired of your games.\"\nThe task took a good deal of time between the two of them, all the while Mike feeling the presence of the rifle in the cabin's far corner. Ambrose sucked in air as he lifted Niki's shoulders and set them crooked on the torn mattress. By the time he looked back up, Mike was halfway across the room.\n\"Why, you...\"\nMike heard the footsteps giving chase, a feeling of panic erupting in his mind as he skidded across the wet, wooden floor falling to his hands and knees. The gun's barrel seemed to beckon from the corner, taunting Mike as he crawled desperately toward his target. He finally reached his goal, raising it in his hands as he turned around to face Ambrose. The weapon felt heavy and unwieldy, and Mike managed the barrel into the right direction only after bracing himself into a sitting position against the corner of the room. Ambrose lay crumpled over the door he had previously smashed, finally awakening with a sudden fury.\n\"You know how long it took you? I was watching!\"\n\"You were out.\" Mike rubbed beads of perspiration off his palms as he searched for the trigger.\n\"Ha! I was pretending. You was slow, chiphead.\"\n\"Am not.\"\n\"Are too!\"\n\"Am not.\"\n\"Are not!\"\n\"Am too.\"\n\"Hahahahahaha,\" Ambrose fell to the floor again, his crackly voice exploding with laughter until he gasped for breath. Mike tried to figure out why as he placed his finger inside the trigger guard.\n\"You forgettin' the safety?\"\n\"Oh yeah.\" Mike found the safety and clicked it off. With a smile and a rush of adrenalin he aimed the rifle at Ambrose.\n\"Go ahead chiphead. Kill me. It's what you wanted to do from the moment I came in here.\"\nMike steadied his aim as Ambrose's image weaved from side to side.\n\"You gutless sushi pie! Hahahah! What are you waiting fer?! You want me to come over there and pull the trigger fer you?\" He stood and began approaching, his mouth forming into a wide, toothy grin.\n\"Stay away. I don't wanna shoot you.\"\n\"Bull!\"\n\"We were just looking for a friend. He's lost.\" Mike felt his lungs gasp for air as Ambrose approached within two meters, the toothy grin turning wicked.\n\"You from off world, ain't cha?!\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You're an alien! Ya wanna see my leader?!\" Ambrose grabbed his crotch. \"Here he is, chiphead!\"\nMike lowered the barrel until it rested against the crotch of the old man's pants. His bright, blue eyes seemed to enlarge in rage as Mike pressed the barrel deeper.\n\"I mean it, Ambrose. Either you leave us alone, or your leader bites the bullet.\"\n\"Pull it, you sticking, loser, good fer nothin' chiphead!\"\nMike waited until the insults subsided before he pulled the trigger, a hollow click being the only result.\n\"Hahahahah...\" Ambrose yanked the barrel from Mike's hands and clubbed him over the shoulder. \"You fergit to load something, chiphead?!\"\nMike fell to the ground before the blow registered in his mind, and even then, what should have been a sharp pain was only a dull throb. He rubbed his shoulder in mild irritation as Ambrose made a long show out of loading his gun. When he finally finished, he made Mike drink two more mugs of \"madre's tea.\"\n\"You a good younger, chiphead. Someday, you'll be a good oldster like me.\"\nMike took it as a reprieve.\n\"You know how old I am? I'm an octogenarian, and I still kick yours!\" Ambrose laughed at the word, and Mike tried to imagine him as an octopus back on Tizar, his long tentacles tossing rifles, tea mugs, and whiskbrooms skyward in an elated dance, the items tumbling like snowflakes caught in a blizzard, only to descend with the distant roar of thunder, the blinding light beyond descending as bolts of fire, igniting the earth in inferno.\n\"Rise an' shine, Vilo...\"\nBill awoke to the gentle nudge, grey eyes opening only as the pain in his ribs startled his senses. A wide shouldered man knelt beside him, his dark face familiar in the glimmering rays of morning light which seeped sluggishly through the barrack entrance. Bill remembered the tackle and subsequent punch to his side, the splintering feeling he chose to ignore. A white bandage covered his ribs.\n\"Madre tells me you'll be breaking fast at her table. My name's Rone.\"\nHe extended a thick, gnarled hand, his thumb only a stump. Bill let himself be yanked up, the man's remaining fingers surprisingly strong.\n\"You hit me with that?\"\nRone nodded with a wry smile, \"Madre's rules. You break it, you gotta fix it. I don't know much 'bout healing ribs though.\"\nThe tired workers cast long, lazy shadows across the wet, open field, a purple sky fading to blue as the rising sun peeked over a distant horizon. A scorched patch of earth was the only reminder of the recent night's tumble, even the stench of black faded to grey with the early morning rains. The house seemed warm and homey in comparison, warm cafe brewing over an open fire, while long, thin strips of quagga flesh sputtered on the grill. In a large pot, a compote mixture of honey syrup and various fruit stewed over a gas flame. Sheff held a spatula in one hand and a mug of steaming, yellow liquid in the other, a grim acknowledgement passing his eyes as Bill entered the kitchen.\n\"Tea, Vilo?\" He motioned to the counter. A tall pot stood beside several half-filled bottles, their labels faded and wrinkled. Bill tried to decipher some of the writing, but met with little success, finally reconciling himself to pouring a mug and handing the container to Rone.\nSeveral of the men had already seated themselves at the round, wooden table, a large seat at the far end remaining empty, as if awaiting some important dignitary. With an almost disciplined uniformity, Bill felt his conspicuous presence carefully ignored. Familiar eyes seemed to avert from their sockets, dry mouths casually striking conversation in a foreign tongue, the dull resonance of their words falling deftly, like snowflakes upon a sodden crater.\nThe black dodecahedron occupied the table's center, a gaudy ornament, seeming more a warning than a trophy. Bill felt his attention involuntarily drawn by the smooth exterior, the shallow etching of a bird trying to fly as stormy, grey eyes flickered with amusement.\n\"Then you know.\"\nThe brittle rasp of her voice snapped his concentration, its harsh tone like a sharp sliver of ice cutting the cords of his throat. Crystal blue eyes betrayed a curious mixture of amusement and disgust as a fine, silver-white mane shifted with the turn of her head.\n\"Vilo, I believe you've met Sule.\"\nBill stared at the offered hand, sharpened nails perfectly transparent, save for their thin, black outline. Madre seated herself at the far chair, seeming to enjoy the moment.\n\"Now show our guest a tad of courtesy. You'll have to forgive him Sule; he's forgotten his gatherer manners.\"\nBill looked up, startled at the comment.\n\"Yes, Vilo... Sule's told us a considerable deal about you and your friends. Not that any of it particularly matters at this point, anyhow.\"\n\"Unless you make it,\" Bill felt a twinge of regret at his words, as though they closed a doorway he'd rather remained open.\n\"We've tried son, now have a seat, before the fast breaks without you.\"\nBill chose a place at the table as Sule stood beside the window, watching the distant tree line.\n\"Will you not eat with us, Sule?\"\n\"I'd rather not.\"\n\"Suit yourself.\" Madre dished out a portion of the compote and sent the rest around the table.\n\"I think you'll like this Vilo. Do they serve Calannic dishes back on Tizar?\"\n\"What else did she tell you?\"\n\"That you're name is William... Willian Walker. I like a boy with W's in his name, but William is just so... I don't know. It sounds so stiff.\"\n\"My friends called me Bill.\"\n\"Now Bill is better, but Vilo takes the icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned. You don't mind it, do you? You mustn't, after all. It's the name you wore in the door. I'd much rather consider it a transliteration than a flat out lie.\"\nBill decided he preferred food to conversation, downing his bowl and filling a second, before looking back across the table. His ears had filtered out the clutter of their alien language, separate discussions merging together as one and then suddenly falling away. Madre seemed to share Sule's fascination with the treeline, letting her eyes wander to the window as she ate.\n\"I haven't told you any lies... yet.\"\nShe glanced back toward him, his words scarcely noticed.\nExcept by Sule, \"What makes you so sure you're going to get another opportunity?\"\nBill turned toward the window. Her eyes seemed to flicker with a quiet sort of laughter, almost mocking in their intensity.\n\"He's not for sale, Sule.\"\n\"I'll throw in an extra million drin.\"\nMadre set her spoon down to the table, wiping her lips with a cloth as if considering the offer.\n\"He's one of my own now; well, since last night, actually. You missed quite an initiation. The point being that he's recognized and can't be sold like some... some hunk of cermic.\" She motioned toward the table ornament.\nSule regarded the statement with a mixture of confusion and resentment, finally turning back toward the window with a sudden movement in the treeline.\n\"I'm sure we can settle the matter at a more convenient hour. It seems that your men have returned.\"\nMadre and Sule waited at the porch as the scout team trudged through the thick, shallow mud. An old man took the forward position, leading the others along the gate's outer edge, through the barbed aisle, and into the inner circlet. The rest of the team broke off from him as he approached the house itself, moving toward the barracks as he waived them away. He finally pulled the hood away from his taunt, weathered face as he ascended the porch steps, letting it settle against the grey shoulders of his coat. His blue eyes seemed to sparkle with a weary brand of playfulness as he focused on the Madre, the drab browns and grays of the landspace serving a subtle contrast.\n\"Sule, this is Ambrose. Ambrose, Sule.\"\n\"You the imp.\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n\"Ha! You been makin' bed too, Madre?\"\n\"And what's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"Heh... you should have to ask... Hey! Be that my food I'm smellin'?\"\nHe stepped toward the door, halting only as she grabbed his shoulder.\n\"Long time, Madre. I understand.\"\n\"Wipe your soles, Ambrose,\" she scolded.\nHe shot her a toothy grin as he kicked the mud off his boots.\n\"Not a way to welcome yer old man...\"\n\"I keep my hospitality for those who earn it.\"\nHis thin, grey lips curled blue against the cold, a lethargic snarl escaping his throat as he pointed a long, bony finger in her general direction.\n\"What in heck's you think I've been doin' woman? Polishin' my one-eye?!\"\n\"In your case, I wouldn't be surprised.\"\nTheir voices slipped into the domestic tongue as they mutually spat a clamor of open insults, Sheff's eyes widening and his sewn lip stretching into an unabashed grin.\nRone stifled a chuckle as he leaned toward Bill, \"Man and wife will be man and wife.\"\n\"Serious?\"\n\"No more so than any other marital ritual. She's mad at him cause he went and left her all alone. He's mad at her cause she threw him out the door... and then some.\"\n\"How often this happens?\"\n\"Oh... once every other season... maybe give two or three. Except for this mornin', before you woke, it was near to a full cycle since I'd seen the man. You think this is bad, you should be here when they break up.\"\nRone turned his head toward the door as the trio ushered themselves inside, Sule skirting along their fringes like an eccentric comet revolving about a closely paired binary. She maintained a blank expression, as though waiting for the commotion to subside. When it didn't, she merely stood there, her impatience become increasingly apparent.\n\"Does ignoring 'em make 'em go away?\"\nBill winced as several of the others laughed at his question, their amusement catching the old man's attention. His bulbarous blue eyes bulged out like two rotten lemons wildly seeking the perpetrator of the query.\n\"Who be the negrali younger?\"\nBill felt numerous pairs of eyes fix on his general location.\n\"Hmmm... you be a popular boy, Billy.\"\n\"You know my name?\"\n\"I just got done blowing holes in yer friends!\" He laughed wildly at the memory, yanking his grey coat open with one hand and pulling a short stocked automatic out with the other. \"Boom boom! Sushi stew! Hah!\"\n\"Ambrose... how could you?\"\n\"Woman, I did it! That's how! Now where's a bowl? Killing makes me hungry.\"\nBill felt his legs kick over Rone's chair as he dove toward the old man, his arms outstretched, fighting desperately to be relieved of their sockets. The barrel smacked him against the side of the skull as he fell, Rone tackling him from behind and ramming a now familiar, mutilated fist into his already broken ribs. The sensation of pain was more numbing than he recalled, suffocating as it fell. He gasped for air, but his lungs felt clogged and heavy, and he choked out the salty taste which swept through his windpipe.\nThe old man spat something in the guttural tongue, the force of his words relieving the pressure on Bill's back. The sharp jab of cold steel replaced the smothering pain, and a safety pin clicked amidst the clutter of alien voices, quietly hushing the static.\n\"No Ambrose. Not in my house.\"\n\"Your house? Woman, you got quagga eggs fer brains!\"\n\"Amb...\"\n\"My offer stands.\" Sule's harsh voice cut through the impending squabble, shattering the old man's attention.\n\"We'll be seein' to you later, ya scrawgy imp!\"\n\"Eleven million drin. Interested?\"\n\"What?!?\"\n\"For him and the black hunk of cermic... center table.\"\nBill felt Rone lift him off the floor as Ambrose gathered the dodecahedron into his free hand.\n\"Heh. Birdy.\"\n\"A robin to be more precise.\"\n\"I knew dat!\" Ambrose leveled the barrel toward her stomach.\n\"Do we have a deal?\"\n\"Sure... eleven em-drin fer Ambro... a robin and a dead younger for the ugly thing.\"\n\"Live younger...\"\n\"No deal.\"\nBill felt Rone cuff his wrists, holding them back and up so he couldn't jerk free. Sule's stare betrayed nothing other than apathy, both for the gun and the man who wielded it.\n\"Name your price.\"\nAmbrose smiled his greedy grin, setting the butt of his barrel against Bill's ear.\n\"Is only one more body for ma cemetery, which is overfull already so I won't be askin' too much. Fifty em-drin, you want him alive.\"\n\"You must be out of your mind.\"\nHis eyes bulged outward, blues and whites confirming her observation.\n\"Don't make me any madder dan I already am. I will blow his fool head off.\"\nHer face remained unchanged, but her eyes seemed to glitter over with laughter. \"Then fifty it is.\"\n\"What? You accept?\" Settling blue eyes stared at her in disbelief.\n\"As if I had another choice.\" She gathered the dodecahedron from the old man's free hand and gently nudged his other aside as she gripped Bill's cuffed wrists and wrenched them upward as far as they'd reach without dislocating his shoulders.\n\"I'll transfer the money into your wife's account.\"\n\"Before you go.\"\n\"Colonel Arman will be arriving shortly. If you don't trust me, then trust him.\"\n\"I trust him all right... just as far as I can kick his blubbery, snot-nosed...\"\n\"Ambrose!\"\nThe salt water used to sting her eyes, something about the sea repelling her even as she used to spend the night along the water's edge. As then, she sat beside him, smoothing the wavy curls of hair as he slept. Their journey to Calanna had been without incident. The Galactican was welcome, or so he'd thought. But something in her eyes told him otherwise, though she'd follow him all the way to her execution. Both knowledge and the sea were like that with her, something that could hurt you but was too big to change. \"Playing with fate is a fool's work.\" It was as if she had foreseen her own, but resigned herself without telling anyone. Not even him.\nThe bullet pierced the tree's lower limb, scattering leaves and berries across the grassy bed below. Mike and Niki awoke with a startle, rolling away from the sturdy trunk as Ambrose giggled with delight, his soggy boots kicking leaves and dirt into their faces.\n\"Ha! You youngers sure is funny.\"\nHe leaned against the trunk, peering up between the leaves at the crisp, blue sky. In his free arm, he carried a large, brown blanket. On his belt, the wood handled axe hung with a small spark lighter. A thin metal disk nestled against his shin, strapped there by a tight elastic cord.\n\"Rise an' shine, sushi-stains... ol' uncle Ambro bring happy tidings fer a happy morn.\"\nMike crawled to his knees, shaking away the fading memories of his dream.\n\"Surprised to be alive?\"\nMike looked at Niki and then back at Ambrose and finally nodded, \"a little.\"\n\"So you should be. I normally kill chipheads just fer bein' chipheads. Nothin' personal about it. But then, you being so recently shaved and all, I figured you must be real cute with a full head o' hair. You are, aren't you?\"\nMike looked back at Niki. She shot him a worried smile, something she'd saved up for a rainy day, he figured. Sunshine spilled over the dew laden grass, the nearby sound of rushing water distracting his senses. He tried to remember when he'd seen Calanna so beautiful.\n\"Hey, you still in lala-land?\"\n\"Where are we?\" Mike stood up and glanced over several rocks beside the stream. The gravchute lay against the nearest boulder.\n\"Well, considerin' everything dere is to consider, I'd say we're at a tea drinkers crash-haven. Not that it matters much. All I know is dat your fandangle o'er dere seemed to suggest it was a nice enough place to stop last night. Me? I don' care much either way.\"\nA cool, morning breeze gathered Niki to her feet, her usually carefree eyes still sharp and bitter, despite the drug's aftertaste.\n\"My stuff.\"\n\"Gone.\" Ambrose announced the word as a matter of fact, as though any more thoughts or emotions on the topic would be wasted. \"All I have fer you is right here.\" He set down the blanket, knife, spark lighter, and rifle. \"Oh yeah, an' dis. Heh, almost fergited.\" He handed her a small slip of paper.\nShe read it momentarily and glanced back up.\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\"What's there not to get?\"\n\"This is a check, made payable to Mike for fifty million drin.\"\n\"Dat's true as my big blue eyes, which nobody fails to notice, Mister Harrison.\"\nMike looked up, realization slowly dawning.\n\"How'd you know my name?\"\n\"I read the papers too, y'know. No sense learnin' Galanglic unless yer gonna. I liked dat piece on Telmar. Very nicely done, and correct to boot. Civil war and all dat. Makes me almost glad to be here instead. I would o' recognized you right off da bat too, if it wasn't fer yer clever disguise.\"\nMike felt the thick stubble on his head, the metal jacks protruding from their dense growth.\n\"Makes you look like a genuine chiphead. I was goin' to blow yer head off, but when you said yer first name, something just clicked in dat old skull o' mine. Not dat I was absolutely sure, y'know. But it did fit, you losin' a friend and all. I understand dat's fairly common.\"\nMike felt his skin grow cold as he pocketed the check.\n\"The only thang I didn't understand, which I'm only beginnin' to, is why yer e'en here. Madre said it was cause the imps nabbed one o' yer friends. I figed dat couldn't be the whole story. Seeing how if it was, you'd be chasin' after all sorts of people everywhere.\"\n\"Right now I'm lookin' for another friend.\"\n\"Huh? Oh, silly me. Talkin' too much and fergitin' why I'm e'en here.\" He reached to his shin, unstrapping a metal disk. \"Go ahead, open it.\"\nMike opened the catch and peered at the dark surface beneath. Several rings were inscribed within the crystal display, and an shiny green dot blinked steadily at the outer circlet, hovering off the display as the rings closed inward, pulling it backward with their retreat.\n\"It's a tracer. That dot is yer friend.\"\nMike looked up, unsure as to whether he could believe the old man.\n\"I know this comes as somethin' sudden, but there was no way we could just let him go. That would be aidin' a criminal. Arman's too familiar with our operation. He knows people don't just escape. It was either give him away once the paperwork got done or sell him off to the imps.\"\n\"Imperials?!\"\n\"They'd have gotten him sooner or later. But time is money, if you know what I mean.\"\nMike nodded, \"And people are profits.\"\nAmbrose snorted at the remark. \"All depends who's buying.\"\n\"At the rate this blip is moving, we're gonna need transportation.\"\n\"Dat's what the money's fer. I've gotta friend, Cole, say 'bout twenty-five an' some odd kilometers downstream. Say Ambrose send ya an' dat yer a payin' customer an' dat ya wanna go straight to Xin. Ya go to Aelflan an' yer a dead man, hear me? By da time yer in city limits, yer have yer friend back in focus. An' with any luck, da imps'll keep dere songbirds in one choir, if ya follow me at all.\"\nMike picked up the gun, checking the magazine for bullets.\n\"Cole's gonna have more o' dat too.\"\n\"I'm not sure how we can thank you.\"\n\"Ha! Don't git mushy now. Blow away a few imps'll be thanks enough fer me. But now dat you mention it, dere is one thing...\"\n\"Anything.\"\n\"Well, I hope it ain't too much, but ya think ya could mention me in da story?\"\nMike grinned at the request as he nodded his acquiescence and tried to imagine what Chuck would think.\nJim's a grad-student at UC Riverside, hoping and praying like crazy that he'll get his MBA before the dean's axe gets him first. In between classes and term papers, he can be found editing `The Guildsman', the raunchiest gaming zine ever to be published. `The Harrison Chapters' were originally written as a setting description for his Traveller (SF-RPG) campaign.

Thirty feet below, a small stag slipped quietly between the sparse nettles, foraging for his breakfast. The slimy mud which had coated her body the night before still masked her scent. Now it was dry and threatened to crackle and fall with her slightest movement, alerting him to the threat.\nSlowly, the creature moved again, somewhere below and near. She peered around her supporting branch and studied the dim terrain through the icy predawn mist. The stag sniffed with his nose to the ground as his pitch black eyes scanned the horizon. Without hesitating another moment she cocked her arm back and let it come down with all her strength. For a heartbeat, the spear seemed to hang motionless, its course predicted by years of practice and an unerring instinct. Then, silently, it consumed the space between them, twirling with reckless abandon as it tore the skin just heartward of his neck, plunging hungrily into the flesh below.\nThe stag cried out as he bolted away, but already his legs had buckled as he tried to run, and the dark stain of blood flooded his coat and dripped to the ground beneath his hooves. The second spear burrowed deep into the middle of his back as he staggered deeper into the brush. She leaped to a lower branch and then to the ground.\nThe stag slowed at the frozen stream bed, turning suddenly to face her. He bravely held his ground, confused and bewildered in the thin morning mist, cautiously dipping his head to the smooth, polished stones as if to drink. His blood splattered carelessly over the rocks, forming crimson puddles in the white frost. The third spear sunk deep into the small hollow above his ribs.\nShe watched, out of spears, as the stag's black eyes seemed to roll upwards toward the sky. The sun's first rays cascaded between the tree branches, warming the cold earth below his hooves as he slowly settled down into the bed of stones to die.\nDawn's saffron rays spiked beneath the dark, shifting clouds like a flock of birds, slowly turning as they plunged toward earth, each gliding back and forth along the icy, lakeside shore. They sparkled across the water's surface as thousands of tiny droplets swooped from the sky, diving and splashing in an endless, majestic dance of laughter and tears.\nMike groggily opened his eyes, sniffing the clean, cold air as the coarse stubble on his head began to prickle and rise against the light drizzle. His booted feet sunk carelessly in the thin silt like two half-buried logs. Niki lay stretched out over a long smooth stone rising from the rippling water, her long black hair beaded with the wet, diamond icing.\n\"Good morning.\"\n\"Is it?\" She finally sat upright, letting her hair fall along her slim shoulders as she pulled her legs inward, locking them into a crossed position. Mike bit his lip as she closed her eyes, ignoring him, the lake, the gentle shower; he watched her soft hair begin to shed its icy glaze, dripping with an almost determined precision.\nFor several minutes she remained motionless, like a statue sculpted from the white stone, searching, opening up into some hollow place inside him. He remembered her drugged, corpse-like body at the Solomon residence, a heartbeat as shallow and distant as some unknown wave rolling steadily for the forbidding shore, the ripples of raindrops mixing with its falling crest, snuffing out its existence as it merged into something greater.\nShe finally opened her eyes, unlocking her legs and letting them dip into the cold water, sloshing them through to the muddy bank, her head drooping low as she walked.\n\"Niki...\"\nShe looked at him, then shifted her eyes to the rifle and axe at his side. He shook his head, not knowing what to say.\n\"Niki, I've seen this before, but never from you. What's the matter?\"\nShe reached out and hugged him, her voice mutely whispering something he could barely hear, much less understand. As though by instinct, his arms tightened protectively around her, holding her for a long minute in the icy mist.\n\"C'mon Niki. We'd best be moving on.\"\nShe pushed his hand away as he reached for the rifle's stock, droplets of water streaming down her cheeks. Lifting it off the brown blanket, she leaned its barrel over her shoulder as she turned to face him.\n\"Dangerous weapon.\"\nMike nodded in acquiescence.\n\"Well, I guess it is your turn.\" He lifted the soaked blanket, wringing it out before rolling it into a tight bundle. Then he reached for the axe. She turned away as he strapped it to his belt.\n\"Any idea which direction?\"\nShe glanced back over her shoulder, her staid expression making him wonder if he slipped into Calannic.\n\"Niki, any idea which way we should go?\"\nShe nodded, \"It won't matter.\"\nMike pondered her words, uncertain how to take their meaning. Something about her mood told him it'd be better if he didn't bother. He peered across the lake for a long moment, his eyes half-expecting to see some dilapidated hydrofoil skirting over the surface water. He shook away the vision and followed her along the shoreline.\nThe black silt gave way to bright yellow sand and shiny beds of smoothed pebbles, the cold ground changing its features with sporadic abandon. Images of the Tizarian coast kept springing to mind, but he shoved the memories down into a place as distant as their origin. The forest lay to the left, trees straddling the lake shore, greedy for the water thus entitled. Long green stems and orange-purple vines hung from the leafy canopy, the pungent smell of apple resin hanging thick in the frosty air.\nThey walked for two hours more before the clouds grew white and parted. Niki's hair, drenched from the rain, seemed to stiffen as it dried. Dark feathered birds appeared from the treeline, their long supple frames gliding gently over the placid waters as they searched for prey. Niki watched them as they'd stop in mid-air and dive into the cold water, their wings flapping with panic as they emerged. Something about the way she carried the rifle told Mike to keep on going, as though she wanted to be alone.\nThe splash turned him around. A short metal-tipped javelin protruded from her belly as she staggered for the stony bank, her hands still knotted around the rifle. Mike raced toward her as a dark, mud-caked figure fell from the branches above, throwing sand into his face as it bolted for the rifle, wrenching it free from her arms as Mike staggered toward them, axe lifted. He hurtled it as the barrel pointed down in his direction, the explosion deafening his ears as a bullet ripped through his shoulder.\nFor the barest instant, all he could do was fall backward into the ground, his mind numbed by the shattered bone. He scampered to his feet, instinctively sprinting into the light thicket, his lungs clogged with terror. Legs tightened painfully as his limp arm swayed back and forth almost comically. His boots kicked furiously against the icy, damp earth, patches of dirty brown snow, and beds of hard stone. Above, in the treetops, the birds fell quiet, and the sparse woods seemed to close around him, silently stealing his breath as he ducked between large bushes and thick trunked trees.\nThe noise of gunfire surrounded his senses, its tangibility offered for the taking. Bits of bark snapped off nearby trees, the wild sputtering, popping sound taking hold of his mind, establishing rhythm in this legs as he stumbled, rolling end over end in the soft loamy earth. She was there before he realized what had happened, his chest heaving desperately, madly sucking in air before it finished pushing breath out. She leveled the barrel between his eyes sockets, cold black opals staring into his without reason or remorse.\n\"No... wait... Ambrose...\" His tongue searched for something in the Calannic, sputtering gibberish from a host of other languages, all stained with worry and confusion. However, the corners of her eyes twitched with recognition, as if he touched a spark somewhere deep in her mind. Finally, he found the words.\n\"Ambrose sent me... to find Cole.\"\nDried patches of mud flaked off her skin as Mike gathered his breath, the hint of recognition blossoming in her eyes.\n\"Get up.\"\nMike complied with her wish, moving where she motioned him with the barrel.\n\"Ambrose doesn't talk to negrali.\"\n\"He talked to me.\"\n\"You have proof?\"\n\"I think you're pointing it at me.\"\nMike wiped the sweat from his forehead as she examined the weapon, hoping against probability that she'd find something distinctive.\n\"Maybe, maybe not. What else?\"\n\"The axe from his cabin. Maybe you've seen it before?\"\nShe cocked a dark eyebrow, her memory of the hurtled weapon still distinct.\n\"Walk.\"\nMike walked. Tall trees loomed overhead as she pushed him forward with the sole of her boot, their wide branches and thick foliage rustling with a gentle breeze. The wide expanse of water remained still, its surface an icy, blue reflection of the morning sky. Niki's crumpled form lay at the water's edge, her legs settling below the silt as her hands gripped the stony bank. The laceration cut deep into her skull, blood dripping from the wound, falling into a crimson pool over the smooth, white stones as it mixed with the soft, black silt.\nThe woman dug the axe from the mud, washing it in the shallows and then lifting it so that the sun's rays glinted off the quick of its blade. She nodded with satisfaction, turning Niki over and searching her body.\n\"Niki...\"\nThe woman looked up, her dark unfeeling eyes staring through him.\n\"Was that her name?\"\n\"I killed her.\"\n\"Yes...\"\nMike moved over to the body, stopping only when she leveled the barrel back in his direction. She glanced him over and unable to ascertain any threat backed away, letting him advance. He felt afraid to touch her, as if the dead body would leap up or cry out. Her flesh was still warm, and he searched half-hearted for a pulse. The girl watched his expression of hope dwindle into one of despair.\n\"C'mon negral.\"\n\"I'd like to bury her.\"\n\"I don't have time to watch you waste yours. Come now or I will leave and let you bleed to death, friend of Ambrose or no.\"\nMike touched his aching shoulder. The cold air bit into his wound, a trickle of blood dripping through the jacket sleeve, the hollow chill slowly gripping his mind. He considered sitting down to wait and imagined Niki waking after a day or two. It wouldn't take long, he figured. He'd keep bleeding, shock would eventually take over, and then...\n\"Negral!\"\nHer short, black hair and dirty, mud-caked body made him think of the salamen on Aiwelk. He remembered crouching in a pool of warm, muddy water, snapping images while two Yahhen hunters readied their gauss guns, cold, black eyes staring skyward, blinded and numbed by the tranq-crystal. They'd die later. Too bad. He'd forgot what they paid him.\nShe tugged him to his feet, pushing him forward with the stock of the rifle. His legs walked at her direction, his mind not bothering to imagine where. Birds, trees, rocks all blended into a single panorama, the separate parts intermixed and suddenly coherent. Spindles of light broke through the forest canopy as they neared the shelter, its dull tin-colored doors marred by bright red paint. An old IMC ammunitions dump. She punched several buttons on the keybox, finally yanking the thick portal open with both arms.\nShe motioned him to an empty, polyceramic crate, watching him sit down and lean over before scrounging the shelves for a first aid kit. Mike felt the lathery foam harden on his bandages before he realized the bleeding had stopped. She's injected him with some wake-up.\n\"You're gonna be needing a doctor.\"\nMike watched her scratch a name on the smooth white surface, as it squeezed his shoulder.\n\"Something to remember me by,\" she added sarcastically.\n\"You're Cole?\"\n\"I think you'll be interested in this.\"\nShe handed him a flimsi-leaf, the lower tech variety with lots of window space but short on memory. His face was reproduced in three-dimensional facsimilation, a standard mug with the hair electronically erased.\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\"Came off the relay three days ago, a chiphead and a psyche, very sorry sight indeed, unless, 'course, you're looking for the reward.\"\n\"Ambrose didn't call ahead?\"\n\"Radio's out. Board's down. All I got left is public relay. Regional News.\"\n\"Then you heard about the drop.\"\n\"I saw it. Kinda hard to miss fireworks that high up.\"\n\"How much've they offered.\"\n\"A million a head, DOA.\"\nMike scowled. It had been several months since he'd been shot, and even longer since he'd lost a friend. He wondered what he was doing back on Calanna, as if one time wasn't enough, and imagined the chain of events that led him back, that led to this. Niki. It wasn't supposed to be like this. The local guard must of known of the drop before the Vista ever reached system, which meant a bug in security: someone very high up, someone who wanted them dead. And Bill had guessed it, hitching along for the sheer hell of it?\n\"The well is never that dry.\"\n\"Say again?\"\nMike shook his head, pale implications fluttering carelessly from the shadows into a hue of light he couldn't accept.\n\"There were two others in the drop.\"\nCole shrugged her shoulders in response.\n\"Did they say there was anyone else they were looking for?\"\n\"No. What's it matter? They probably didn't know who was coming down, anyway.\"\nMike rubbed the scarred side of his face. It was this sort of underestimation that kept getting him in trouble. Back on the Vista, he'd wondered what Bill was doing. \"Lots of neutrinos,\" he'd said. That would mimic a fusion plant on almost any passive array, making Robin a target so bright the Calannans couldn't help but take her out. Mike wanted to dissect her, not blow her to pieces, though he had to admit the thought was somewhat appealing.\n\"Did I miss a joke or something?\" Cole looked mildly annoyed. Mike remembered the hollow feeling as his gaze fell upon the axe. Its dull blade seemed to laugh wickedly from the shelter's dim corner.\n\"I've got to get to Xin. I'll have money once we're there.\"\n\"Just like that.\"\n\"Ambrose said you could take us... me.\" He turned his eyes away from it, unwilling to meet its laughter or to accept what had happened.\n\"In your condition...\"\n\"In my condition, I could use a doctor. You said so yourself.\" He tried to smile, \"Don't go denying it.\"\nThe smile wouldn't come. Niki was back there still, growing colder by the minute. His fault.\n\"Why are they after you?\"\n\"It's a long story.\" He looked away from her as he answered, unable to make eye contact.\n\"The relay doesn't even give a name. What should I call you, negral.\"\n\"Mikael.\"\nShe nodded, strangely, as if considering its flavor. He wondered why she bothered; all she should want is the money. It made things much simpler. Money.\n\"Come.\"\nHis feet felt wobbly as he stood. She held his good arm with her free hand, gathering the axe and rifle as she led him outside and along a winding, dirt path. The glittering lake waters seemed to dance and rejoice as if in celebration. Mike watched for Niki's body on the stony beach, but it was as if she had disappeared, the hungry lake gobbling her up with gleeful abandon.\nThe hydroplane sat docked in a shallow inlet, its grey, metallic sheen casting a fuzzy shadow across the waters. They waded in. The water, more than waste deep, felt icy and numbing. Cole settled him into the passenger seat, buckling him down before producing another hypo.\n\"Is that really necessary?\"\n\"Not at all.\" She stuck him in his good arm, retracting the needle with a satisfied smirk.\n\"You bitch.\" Mike watched her climb around to the pilot's controls, her long, sun-browned legs now shiny and clean as late morning rays filtered through the cockpit window. The whine of a chemical motor echoed somewhere along the distant coastline. Beneath its vibration, Mike heard her whispering, the rattling of vertical rods, grimy steel stained with sweat and a hollow explosion mixed within the shattered bone, a texture so familiar and soft, as though it were meant to be felt rather than understood. Shades of blue huddled together beneath folds of green and grey, his limbs tiring, nerves deadened, the dry cold parching his throat as the sweet scent of apple resin stung within the dark corners of his memory.\nTheir voices rose as hushed murmurs, traces of worries averted, clandestinely dropping out of key like some harmonic duet, each resurrecting the other, interchanging places, holding together for sheer lack of hope.\n\"We knew this would eventually happen.\" His tone sounded cold, unfeeling. She saw the door crack open, streams of moonlight licking around its edges.\n\"Michael. Is that you?\"\nThey were afraid to touch him, afraid to even get too close. Dim fluorescent rays scattered sullenly along the glassy white walls, barely penetrating the icy darkness as he slowly wakened from a dreamless sleep. A grey-haired stranger sat by his bedside staring down from behind a professional expression of stoic indifference.\nThe loneliness quietly crept in between the cracks of his senses, stealthily slipping beneath his skin, and hungrily gnawing on his bones. With cunning elegance it swept upwards, through his spine and into his mind, knotting itself around his soul and slowly squeezing until he could feel the suffocating, smothering, nothing.\nThe woman curiously smiled. She wore a white medical tunic without insignia or decoration. He concentrated on her face, on the stormy blue of her eyes and the furrow of her brows, but the features just blurred in and out of focus, shifting like waves on some forgotten shore. He felt his lungs try carefully to breath; short, unfamiliar, raspy sounds being the only response.\nShe turned away suddenly, something was beeping, another patient maybe, or perhaps someone died. She was talking to someone now through a commlink. Her voice flowed sweetly, like warm rain on summer days when he would walk through the barrens and nobody would follow.\nA cold lump settled in his throat as he waited for her to return, the cool breeze lifting brown and yellow leaves from the broken asphalt, coiling sticky shapes, their edges fluttering and preparing to strike. And the awful beeping, rising from the air like some depraved siren, stung his ears, its intensity rising. He wished somebody would turn it off and found himself reaching out, his fingers touching it, the pulse tangible and real like a heartbeat, except stronger.\n\"Mike.\" From a deserted alleyway he heard the voice call him. He paused before moving forward, unable to see its source.\n\"Wake up Mike. Get the hell outta there, now!\"\nHe felt his eyes snap open with the surge of electricity in his mind. Sweat coated his body as he laid face-up on a simple mattress in a small, dark room, cords of sunlight streaming from the only window through a pair of wooden shutters. Police sirens beeped loudly in the distance as a gentle rain pelted the open ledge. Cecil? He looked around for the voice, but the room was empty. He pulled himself upright with his good arm, shaking off the daze of noises and confusion as the metal disk tumbled from his pocket. The dim light played over its surface, tempting him to pick it up. He pressed it against his bad hand, clenching it with all his strength to force away the numbness and triggered the catch, revealing the black surface within. The green dot closed in toward the center, circular lines growing brighter, pressing outward, fifty meters, forty-five, forty.\nMike closed the disk, placing it back within his pocket. Beads of sweat formed on his scalp as he moved toward the window, lifting the shutters and crawling onto the ledge. He was four stories up. A good jump? Teeth ground together at the thought as drizzle mixed with the perspiration, forming a tiny rivulet down the crevice of his nose.\n\"Hey Mike? You in there?\" It was Bill's voice. \"Open up Mike, it's okay.\"\nHe crawled out further along the ledge, pulling his legs away from the window. Vehicles knotted together in the streets below, chemical combustion motors sputtering, whining, complaining to their drivers beneath the dying sirens. The door broke open. There was the sound of footsteps and an unfamiliar voice as dry as caster-sand.\n\"Shit!\"\nGalanglic. Mike considered crawling back inside, then stopped.\n\"I want his head you little weasel, you understand?! He knows to much about Erestyl.\"\nMike could almost see Bill nodding on the other side of the wall.\n\"I'll... I'll wait here until he comes back.\"\n\"What makes you think he'll return?\"\n\"Where else can he go? He has no money.\"\nWooden shutters swept away from the window face, the crackling noise of metal and wood in violent separation resounding through the room. Mike waited, breathlessly, for a head to peek out as small black birds scattered along the ledges above and below.\n\"Harrison has friends on Calanna, or have you forgotten? He'll have ways of getting money.\"\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\"First get that thing out of your kneecap.\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"I trust you'll be able to figure the rest out yourself.\"\nMike waited another two minutes as vehicles carelessly zigzagged on the streets below. The small, black birds returned to their cement roosts, the outcroppings serving as poor protection from the rain. Like the wandering beggars, they seemed ready to take whatever handout fate should devise. Mike finally crept back inside and past the splintered door.\nThe rain smelled musty and noxious, exhaust fumes clogging his throat and stinging his eyes as he drifted along narrow walkways beside the ground traffic. Street urchins clothed in dapple-gray kirtles and drab brown coifs played amidst the traffic, climbing onto the slow, red cabs to ask for money and ganging together for some bashing to keep the stingy in line. Bums sat huddled along the gutters, some clenching bottles and others holding small, box batteries with thin, elastic cords connected to their head-jacks, their emaciated bodies slowly rotting in the gentle rain as thin smiles played across their lips, eyes glazed-over with the entertainment of some abstract fantasy.\n\"K'drin onuvalye?\" One grabbed for Mike's boot as he passed by. \"Daro!\" The box was out of juice, and he wanted money to recharge it; just one chiphead asking another for a small, important favor. Mike kept walking, finally stopping in front of a large window facing the street. He did look like a chiphead, even worse perhaps. The stubble on his head did a poor job of concealing the jacks, and his left shoulder, still numb, sat firmly in its temporary cast beneath the coat. He pulled the disc from his pocket and glanced at the readings. Bill was on foot, less than half a kilometer and heading northeast, toward the city's heart, toward the underway probably.\nMike turned and picked up the pace. He'd have to cut through the rowens to catch up. Just his luck. The ground changed abruptly from wet, black asphalt to soggy, brown dirt as he skirted from the roadside and hopped the rusty gate. The fumes and noises of traffic seemed to fall away as he crossed over the damp earth, a peaceful, musty quiet replacing the garble of chaos. Long columns of raised earth, sparse trees, and an occasional thatch hut served as the only occupants. At least it was still light out, he reminded himself. Stiff grey clouds loomed above, blocking the sun's gaze. He tried to make out where it rested, but it was no use. Morning, afternoon, or evening, it didn't matter anyway. It was day, and his chances of getting accosted were slim.\nEven so, he breathed easier when the tall buildings of the uptown came into focus behind the curtains of falling rain. Mike hopped the outer gate with a sigh of relief and headed toward the underway, rechecking the disc's display with a nod of satisfaction. Bill was right on schedule. Now the problem of acquiring fare came into focus. Mike remembered the check Ambrose had given him and felt around in his pockets, the slow realization that he'd been robbed dawning on him for the first time. Her name still lay etched in his cast, an unpleasant reminder, but then he should have expected as much. That was fifty million drin washed down the drain with five to ten thousand being all he'd need for trans-fare. Mike cut through the back allies, memory tracing his steps into the pawnshop.\nAn old man with a thick, red beard and pot-belly knelt beside a wooden stool, spray coating its legs with a plastic adhesive. He ignored Mike as he continued working.\n\"Hi.\"\n\"Ain't got no juice.\"\n\"I'm looking to sell.\"\nThe man glanced up from the stool, seemingly unimpressed.\n\"This coat.\"\nThe man continued layering the legs, the nerves in his hand jittering the fingers as he sprayed.\n\"How much can I get for it?\"\n\"That coat has a hole in the shoulder. And it's stained.\"\n\"I need ten thousand.\"\nHe put down the spray can and turned the stool upside-down, setting it on its seat.\n\"How about five then?\"\n\"It's worthless.\"\n\"One.\"\nHe shook his head with annoyance as he unscrewed the nozzle head, replacing it with another.\n\"C'mon. Give me a break. I was shot today.\"\n\"Nice boots you got.\"\n\"They're offworld.\"\nMike kicked them off and let the man examine them.\n\"Contraband?\"\n\"No. Its legal. Look, it adjusts for the size.\"\n\"That's pretty tricky. I'll give you twelve.\"\n\"Fifteen, and I'll throw in the coat.\"\nHe shrugged, taking the coat to examine.\n\"See? Pockets on the inside.\"\n\"What, do I look blind to you?\"\n\"No, not at all.\" Mike shook his head trying hard to sound sincere.\n\"Fifteen.\"\nMike strode barefoot, avoiding the broken glass as he headed toward the underway. The disk showed Bill ahead of him but not by more than a hundred meters. Mike slowed his pace, taking the escalators down to the ticket dispensers as a computer synthesized voice droned above the background chatter.\n\"Welcome to Xin terminals. Please have exact fare ready. CME cards accepted.\"\nOnce in the ticket lobby, Mike leaned against a shaded wall as he consulted the disc. Hundreds of people lined up against the dispensers, a young couple swapping spittle to the self-sustained ignorance of those around them, a three-year old kicking his mother's knees as he swung from her brown satchel, a tall chiphead with spokes for jacks eating a quagga and manouri on rye, drinking something blue and bubbly from a leftover sluice tube. The green dot dipped off the display at it headed south, the concentric circles shifting first into ovals and then narrowing into thin slivers of their former shapes and the dot came back into view for a moment and then descended off the surface entirely. Mike pocketed the disc and stepped into line behind the spokes man.\n\"Where's the output, dude?\"\nMike looked up, surprised. The chiphead took a swig from his sluice tube and offered the rest to Mike.\n\"You get fucked up?\"\n\"Ummm... no thanks.\"\n\"Damn, EI receiver point. You even got a manipulator plug. Y'know, you can hook in an output jack there real easy. I know this guy who'll do it for pretty cheap.\"\nHis eyes roamed Mike's scalp with fascination.\n\"You interested?\"\n\"I'm kind of in a hurry.\"\n\"Hey, no problem.\"\nHe turned around to buy his ticket, pausing at the entry gates before continuing.\n\"Just leave a message on the `Doggie Blitz' if you change your mind.\"\nMike nodded as he fingered in his destination, the synthesized voice finally acknowledging his presence.\n\"Your fare is eight thousand five hundred drin.\"\nHe shuffled a ten into the machine.\n\"Do you accept credit for non-exact amount?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Thank you for traveling the Underway.\"\n\"As if I had a choice...\" Mike grabbed his ticket and entered through the gates, another machine snapping up his slip of magnetic paper and returning it as he passed to the other side. \"Credit: Drin 1500\" was etched in red symbols at the upper right-hand corner of the stub.\nThe trams sat cushioned on gravitic fields, a recent innovation Mike recalled as he boarded. Most everything other than transportation and communication was despairingly backwater, even in the capital's suburbs. He found a seat at the back of the last car. Only two others entered with him, the young couple. Probably evening then, he figured, everybody's going the other way. They resumed their foreplay as the tram picked up speed, and Mike turned his head more out of embarrassment than courtesy.\n\"Feeling lonely?\" Mike sat up, suddenly surprised. \"Come to 'Temple of the Mermaid' where your whim is my command.\" The feminine voice continued babbling over the car's speakers as the girl started licking her boyfriend's face. The guy watched Mike out of the corner of his eye, a cocky smirk playing across his lips. \"Satisfaction guaranteed, or your money back.\"\nThe tram finally stopped, Mike pulling the disc from his pocket and consulted its display as the doors slid open and several dozen people entered. Bill was within half a kilometer and moving on the rollers. Mike pocketed the disc and slipped outside the car as its doors slapped shut behind him.\nSeveral rollers coasted by on cermelecon rails, arched bridges making way for their passage. Mike hopped on one and inserted two thousand drin. The digital gauge clicked away as he stepped on the acceleration peddle and gripped the handrails. Soon he was in the city's midst, the canopy of stone several hundred meters high and around him thousands of sparkling lights, a latticework of railings, glowing exit pads, steel office complexes sitting atop large cylindrical stalks, one built atop the other, and a hive of cable connections hanging in the air like uncropped weeds taking over a forest. Suddenly he realized he was sitting still, the roller having shuffled off to the side so others could pass. A small red light blinked near the money slot and zero's glared out from the counter.\nMike inserted another thousand and parked the roller before the money clicked away. Two women in dapper, black frocks raced toward him in long, determined strides, pushing past to the free roller before anyone else could beat them to it. Meanwhile, large, circular, iris valves continued disgorging a steady stream of mainly government tight-necks, a few laughing but most sedate, languid, or exhausted. Glowbeads sparkled on the sides of the escalators like little droplets of sunshine, and as a line of rollers passed overhead, their bright rims cast a dizzying array of colors on the velvety black sheen of the thick, airy mist in the space beyond.\nThe disk showed Bill remarkably close, and Mike felt his head duck almost imperceptibly as he crossed, unhurried, into a deserted portal. The reading shifted slightly, circles bending again into ovals. Mike tapped the surface with his index finger and eyed the double doors of a maintenance lift. Suddenly the green dot flickered and died. He cupped the disc into his pocket and headed out the portal, finding a cool table beneath the shade of a low hanging ceiling. The table's surface displayed the menu, showing two-dimensional pictures of each of the meals. Mike settled for a glass of ice water, inserting a thousand drin into the slot and collecting his change. The crystal cubes were still making a faint sizzling sound as they clinked against the inside of the glass. Mike sipped the fluid, the fuzzy numbness slowly receding from his shoulder as he watched the portal.\nHe turned back to the table's smooth surface and brought up an area map of the city. Xaos, pronounced Za'-os by the natives, was the capital of the lesser continent. Excavated long before the civil war, it was utilized during the planetary revolt as a stronghold of last resort. Its location, several kilometers beneath the seabed, was virtually unassailable except by the thermonuclear warheads which the Archduke would never use. Afterwards, it grew, large suburbs like Xin and Xekhasmeno rising at the surface like the first seedlings of a dwearmurgrove. Mike examined the display. They'd done a good deal of construction over the past two years. He brought up a voice window on the display and pressed a few more keys on the interface, depositing his change back in the money slot. The channel clicked several times before there was any answer.\n\"This number had been disconnected... if you need directory assistance, please dial...\"\nMike killed the window and searched through directory assistance for `Cecil Dulin.' He then expanded it to the suburbs and ran a search of the local emigrations and obituaries, finally punching a few more keys in frustration. A red light flickered on the display. Insufficient funds for a planetwide directory search. He slammed his good fist against the table surface without effect. The display shimmered, seeming to laugh at him from behind its protective cover.\n\"Have it your way,\" he finally conceded, taking the disc once again from his pocket and consulting the reading. Somebody put money in a soundbox, and Mike found his bare toes involuntarily keeping time with the music as he rubbed his bad arm beneath the castfoam and patiently waited for the reading to stabilize. The green dot remained stationary, glowing steadily just beyond the fifteen meter mark and then suddenly disappeared.\n\"This isn't my day.\"\nMike plucked the surface with a wary finger as the empty ovals glared back at him.\n\"C'mon Bill, don't do this to me...\"\nMike pocketed the disc and pulled himself up from the table. The portal beckoned from across the walkway, its keypad nestled against the maintenance lift doors. Stern, blue letters marched across the lock's indicator, \"access code required.\" Gears began whining as Mike stepped to the side, clenching his good hand into a tight fist. The double doors opened, and Bill started out, his long, lanky arms dangling to his sides as his mouth opened in a wide, toothy grin. Mike caught him in the neck with his fist, taking him backwards with the blow. As Bill lay on the lift's floor, crumpled and choking, Mike kicked him once in the stomach and twice in the nards. Satisfied, the older gatherer twisted the lift's operating lever and quickly removed Bill's fiberglass pistol as the doors slowly shut.\nFor a moment, stormy grey eyes betrayed anger and fear. After that, there was only shame. Mike looked down, a course determination quietly roiling within his guts as Bill clutched his crotch with both hands.\n\"You bastard!\"\n\"Niki's dead, Bill.\"\n\"So, ya gonna shoot me?\"\n\"I'm thinking about it.\"\nThe lift stopped, its doors opening at Mike's back as he quickly spun to the side of the lift.\nThe room was cluttered with a variety of maintenance equipment and medical gear. Two semi-automatic carbines rested on the far wall, and a portable microframe lay at the floor's center along with a package of optical storage disks and a large, black dodecahedron. The room's furniture was sitting in the corner, a single, short, wooden stool.\n\"Nice place, Bill. You get good rent?\"\n\"Real good.\"\nMike shook his head in concentrated disbelief.\n\"Go on.\"\nBill let himself be kicked forward into the chamber, the cool flow of ventilation cutting across his shoulder blades as he retreated into the dim light of an electric lantern.\nMike sat stiff in the corner rubbing his bandaged shoulder. Her name lay etched in the white surface.\n\"You get shot again or somethin'?\"\n\"Here, why don't you come over and take a closer look,\" Mike invited with a sarcastic snarl.\n\"Mama gave it to ya?\"\n\"That's close enou...\"\nA shin snapped into his forearm, and Mike found himself reeling off-balance, falling backwards as Bill's fist nailed him in the midsection. He never heard the stool splitting against the floor planks as he tumbled backwards. Instead, silence seemed to surround him entirely, and then there was only the deafening echo that followed the silence and Bill slipping quietly along the floor within the pool that was his own blood.\n\"You stupid fuck!\"\n\"Sorry, Mike...\"\nA twinkle of amusement roamed through his eyes, the grey spheres seeming webbed within the clouds of a paternal haze.\n\"Bill!\"\nJim's a grad-student at UC Riverside, hoping and praying like crazy that he'll get his MBA before the dean's axe gets him first. In between classes and term papers, he can be found editing `The Guildsman', the raunchiest gaming zine ever to be published. `The Harrison Chapters' were originally written as a setting description for his Traveller (SF-RPG) campaign.

Xkutyr was known locally, as well as abroad, as the undercity of sleepless dreams. Before the war, the Duke of Arcadia was said to be a frequent visitor, reputedly lounging within the watery, volcanic caverns awaiting noble orgies too numerous to enumerate. At least, that was the popular philosophy. History on Calanna was jaded at best, most recently by the war. Mike had always regarded the stories as a poor attempt at anti-Imperial propaganda, but whenever he visited the Temple of the Writhing Mermaid, he was always persuaded to reconsider his point of view.\nOn this occasion the waters churned with unusual vivacity, the warm glow of soaking bodies paddling on the surface as others more intrepid ventured beneath, between the terraces of gravity nullifiers and into the labyrinth beyond. Mike found himself swimming within a crowd of strangers, some groping each other for comfort and others huddled within large floating bubbles of oxygen, bodies intertwined, playing games of the flesh for all to see. Together they imbibed amber and purple fluids from plastic sluispheres, bubbles within bubbles holding potent aphrodisiacs, judging from the inclinations of those who shared them.\nMost came here out of boredom, hoping to find fascination in a moment's idle folly. Others, however, came here out of pain, a few thousand drin to smother one burrowing intoxication with yet another and that perhaps with another still. Of course it was all Bill's money, but that didn't matter; he wouldn't need it anymore. Mike was sure of that much.\nHe swam until the water grew cold and dense and the oxygen bubbles became too few to venture further. Alone in an alcove he shivered, bare of everything save the mandatory wrist locator. The air grew musty and coarse and he tried to close his eyes and sleep, but the water was too frigid this far out from the complex. Suddenly bubbles emerged from below and a woman clad in a gelsuit appeared, her black hair slicked back by the cold water as she emerged.\n\"Vanwalye?\"\nMike regarded her question for all of five seconds.\n\"Uh...No.\"\n\"Uquenlye Calain?\"\n\"Umm...lastalmet.\"\n\"Tulye?\"\nMike wondered if he had a choice. They had probably seen how far he was going and sent her out to fetch him back. There was nothing like a troublesome offworlder to piss off the management. Her worried, green eyes seemed to confirm the assessment.\n\"Okay,\" Mike nodded. She moved closer to help him.\n\"No, really, I'm fine. I'll just follow. Hilmet. Okay?\"\n\"Okay,\" her anxious smile confirmed the communication more than her use of the galanglic. She kept a slow pace, feeding him oxygen from her tank at several intervals. By the time they reached the warm waters, Mike figured he was lucky he hadn't ditched the locator.\nAfter he dressed, Mike spent the next hour sitting at a table along the stony terrace, sipping Miruvor and re-scanning the various databases. The girl came back to check on him, apparently trying to tell him something from the ledge before being yanked backward into the bubbly water by another employee. Mike waved as she was dragged beneath the steaming surface. The bottom half of her gelsuit emerged several moments later, floating around the surface as various patrons began tossing it back and forth between the access pools.\nCecil was nowhere to be found. Even the search on the planetwide directory turned up nothing. Mike went back to investigating the local boards when he came across a familiar name.\n\"Doggie Blitz?\"\nHe entered within the steady stream of other electronic freefloaters, quietly carousing the various sub-boards for something of interest. He then passed along to the membership records, or at least those sections open for public scrutiny. A number of faces flashed across his screen, most of them chipheads, one of them strangely familiar.\n\"Check 143\/741.\"\n\"User online.\"\n\"Call him.\"\n\"Error. Respecify at call.\"\n\"Call 143\/741.\"\n\"Waiting...connect.\"\n\"Yo?\"\n\"Umm...Hi, 'member me? Command open visual. Umm...in the underway. Purchasing tickets?\"\n\"Huh? Oh yeah. You lookin' fer some output.\"\n\"That's right. I was wondering if maybe we could meet someplace. I may have more than just output in mind.\"\n\"Such as...\"\n\"Finding a friend of mine.\"\n\"Well, I guess that depends mainly on who it is you're looking for. If you could just give me the name now, I'd be able to give you a better idea when we meet.\"\n\"You sure that's safe?\"\n\"Uhhh...let's see...you're in sector thirteen. Let me re-pipe this, hold on... Okay, go ahead.\"\n\"The name is Cecil Dulin. He used to be a local res...\"\n\"Hold on... Did you say Cecil Dulin?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Uhh... Sorry, I don't think I can help you there dude.\"\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\"Gotta jam.\"\n\"Wait... damnit.\"\n\"Na Manor.\"\n\"Huh? Oh, hi. I thought you lost your suit.\"\n\"Ulastalmet.\"\n\"Uh...Nevermind.\" Mike reverted to the Calannic, but his words came out wrong when he tried to explain anything too complex. Her green eyes twinkled as she laughed, either perceptibly oblivious to his being both an offworlder and a chiphead, or incapable of harboring either of the two most common prejudices.\n\"I no understand why you go in cold water without air tank.\"\n\"Umm...I dunno either.\"\nShe liked that one. Her eyes seemed to glitter more with each new giggle, the easy laughter reminding him of Niki, but her eyes were too shallow and sparkly. Mike rubbed his cast, still encased in its mermaid-plastic sheath, wondering how long the tissue- stabilization would last.\n\"Where you are staying?\"\n\"Umm...no place yet.\"\n\"Ah, you just arrive then.\"\n\"You could say that.\"\n\"You looking for a place on computer?\"\n\"I'm looking.\"\n\"Hard to find.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Maybe you find a friend?\"\nMike froze cold before he realized what she meant. She started giggling again, taking his look entirely the wrong way.\n\"You do find friend. Is easy here. Yes?\"\n\"If you say so.\"\n\"If you like, I have extra space.\"\n\"Between your ears,\" Mike added in Galanglic.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Never mind.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"Well... Okay. Sure.\"\n\"Okay?\"\nThe cold breeze gave ample excuse for her to nuzzle against him as they exited the underway, the puddles of water on the streets congealing with motor oil and fragments of dead leaves in the dim light of actinic lamps. Drunk stragglers and chipheads were the only inhabitants between the occasional cabs carrying home a late-shifter from the city below. Several drivers huddled just outside the doors, gambling via coin-toss and drinking mataxa.\n\"Hey, any of you speak Galanglic?\"\n\"Quesse? Hallon...neghral?\" They seemed to get a good laugh.\n\"Very funny; maybe you speak the universal language.\" Mike rubbed a fifty k'drin note between his forefinger and thumb.\nHe rode with Vilya in the back seat, watching a pale fog build on the windows as they drove to the outskirts of the city. At a quiet intersection, Mike nudged the driver and pointed to a corner tele-booth.\n\"Dalmet?\"\n\"Stop. You wait.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Wait. Stay here.\"\n\"No go?\"\n\"No go.\"\nHe entered the booth, hitting the operator assistance key while depositing several coins. Outside, the driver rubbed his windshield with a dirty, brown rag.\n\"Gardansa, first name Narsil. Yes. Hello? Yes, I know what time it is. I need to speak with the General--just tell him it's Michael Harrison.\"\n\"Meow.\"\nMike awoke as something clawed his head jacks, a cool ripple of pain flowing across his skull as he bolted upright, tossing the feline across the room.\n\"You no like pussy?\"\nA faint shimmer of light caught the pistol's fiberglass barrel, Vilya lowering it just a notch as she waited for Mike's reply. He studied her eyes, green spheres twinkling with mischief.\n\"I find out what `between your ears' mean, asshole.\"\nShe clicked back the pistol's lever, preparing for the shot as she licked her lips. Too high and she'd make a mess. Too low and she'd have to use another bullet. Mike stared straight down the barrel, trying arrogantly to suppress the cool sweat breaking along the jacks in his skull. She pulled the trigger, the barrel clicking with a faint resonance.\n\"Ha ha. Me funny.\"\nMike batted the gun out of her hands, tumbling out of the bed as she scampered across the floor. She finally locked herself inside the bathroom, her spasmodic laughter ringing through the keyhole.\n\"Come out here, Vil.\"\n\"No way! You apology.\"\nHe pocketed the gun and searched though his bag, finally finding the bullets beneath the dodecahedron.\n\"Me?!\" Mike nearly gagged, pointing the weapon toward the bathroom door. \"I think you're forgetting one little thing. I'm the one who has the gun now.\"\n\"Ha ha ha...\"\n\"Meow.\"\n\"Or maybe I should just shoot your cat.\"\nThe door opened and Vilya crossed the floor to her cat, picking him up and returning to the bathroom before Mike could so much as bat an eyelash.\n\"Vilya.\"\n\"Hee hee hee...\"\n\"Meow.\"\nMike lifted the dodecahedron off the floor, nestling its weight in his lap. Its ceramic exterior carried a dull glimmer in the warm morning light, each surface flat and smooth except for one. There lay etched the figure of a songbird, its wings outstretched as though in flight. Mike regarded it with an unfamiliar mixture of relief and apprehension.\n\"Apology!\"\n\"Fine. I'm sorry.\"\n\"I can't hear you.\"\nThe ragged curtain of red twill flapped from the window's edge as he cocked the pistol.\n\"Hee hee hee...\"\nHe finally coaxed her out of the bathroom by frying up a can of mash and onions, the most universal sustenance in her cupboards. They ate in between the morning newsvids and cold cups of zardocha. The gatherers on the monitors were a pair of public faces, computer generated images which the government had been using for newscasts over the past century. The eyes of the female seemed to bulge out and cross as though she were reading from cue cards, an effort to make her image more realistic. Mike remembered reading about the development in an industry update.\n\"And now to the local headlines. An unidentified woman was killed yesterday in gunfire at the 1st Interstellar Bank. Although officials are withholding her name, the victim was purported to be in the process of cashing a promissory note for fifty million drin. It is believed that the check was stolen from one, Michael James Harrison, an independent gatherer with Galactic Publications. According to the GID, Harrison was terminated by the woman in accordance with global bounty codes and that the shooting was an unlawful retaliation by the Galatican. Harrison, author of Shattered Eden, gained interstellar fame with the...\"\nMike changed the channel as his press image materialized in the corner of the screen.\n\"Hey! I was watching,\" Vilya flicked a speck of potato in his general direction. The other channels proved just as dull, but the ensuing battle over the remote control made up for it. He found himself back on her bed, exhausted, as she left for work, her cat purring at his side in contented bliss.\nOutside, the afternoon sun sank slowly into a hazy dusk as Mike patiently hoofed his way across the city. Cecil had been waiting for well over a year, and another cent wouldn't matter.\nThe ochin dangled precariously from a single thread of its silken web as its spindly legs flailed aside the remains of its latest victim, a tiny mitzignat. The insect's carcass tossed and turned slowly within the nullfield until a lazy spitter gobbled it down with a swift dash of it sticky tongue. Tasting the pungent fragrance of the ochin's poison, the spitter turned sideways and retreated into the darkness.\nThough still hungry, the ochin felt safer. Warily, it crept along the narrow commcord which served as a spine to the web, providing some structural foundation for the fragile strands of its home. A dim buzz resounded against the walls of the room as the ochin reached the end of the commcord. It paused to feel the momentary vibrations on the cool air.\nThe man couldn't hear the buzz. He hung limp in the air, supported only by thin fractures in the null-gravity. His dull senses couldn't feel the ochin as it slowly edged its way along his grizzly beard, searching the maw of unkept hair for juicy goobugs. His thick, oily thatch barely left an egress for the slimy worms which secreted their viscous ooze.\nSuddenly the gravmodule flickered, and his body slowly descended to the wooden floor, ripping away the ochin's web and scattering the boopreys as the dusty, maggot-ridden planks creaked soundly underneath the weight of his emaciated body. He lay still for several hours without breathing, his programs refusing the interruption. The uncompromising feeder, however, forced a disconnection as his weak lungs involuntarily gasped for air.\nIt was evening before he could feel the raw itch. It came on slowly, like a sleeping devil, seeming a thousand times more penetrating than anything he could ever remember. For hours he lay still, unable to resolve the agony before his olfactory senses came around, allowing him to smell the hellish stench of his own rot. Yet, the itch and the stench only served as a distraction which he used to fight the maddening bunkum of raw data which muttered sporadic illusions within his mind.\nSlowly, he felt the enzymes go to work, exciting his endocrine gland, pushing adrenalin into his bloodstream, building momentum in his heartbeat, fighting the impending shock. He fluttered his eyelids, the action igniting a stream of ideas, each vaguely interrelated, but they swept by so swiftly that all he could remember was the fragment of a distant dream.\nSlowly, he realized that he was sitting upright. He heard the distant hum of the spitter in the corner of the room. The feeder lay next to him. It was already disconnected. He couldn't remember touching it.\n\"Who's there?\"\nHis voice sounded dry and mottled. He couldn't recognize it as his own, but there it was with nobody to answer. Then he heard the door close.\nThe tub was brown with mold; a family of quagroachs nested on the floor beneath the grating. He tumbled himself inside and searched for the rusty handle. The ice-cold water hammered against the floor, bathing his still insensitive skin as he rubbed off folds of dead flesh. Soon the welts that merely itched began to sting.\nThe scum collected around his neck as the waterline threatened. He stood slowly, his arms grasping the grimy runners on the walls of the tub. As the water continued to rise, overtaking his waist, he let one hand fall away, testing the strength of his legs and their balance.\nHe wasn't aware of the blade until it cut his ear. He tugged it loose from its cord and began to shave, slicing the filthy hair away with deep strokes close to the skin. The goobugs dropped into the water around his waist. Tangled deep within the matted hair, they sunk and drowned beneath the pounding water. He fingered his skull for the jacks; the important things were always as he remembered them.\nHe was too tired to think about it now. The water at his chest beckoned. He considered how easy it would be to drown. He sunk down beneath the murky water, its numbing chill bringing with it a strange sense of satisfaction. With a twist of the lever, the floor beneath the grating opened, and the water, bugs, and hair swirled away.\nMoonlight shimmered through the doorway like a icy veil, its narrow edge stretching across the hardwood floor. She stepped quietly into the dim, misty light, letting her bags slip clumsily from her arms.\n\"Mikael? You still here, you leech?\"\n\"Meow...\"\nA purple glimmer settled beneath patchy, black clouds along the western horizon as the red cab swerved along the central highway. The driver hummed to himself most of the way, his right foot jogging a tempo against the floor as he drove. Mike tried to fall asleep, but the bumping of wheels into shallow potholes made him nauseous. They were nearly three hours outside Xin when the car turned off the pavement, taking a dirt trail up a grassy hillside, wildflowers growing in yellow and blue patches along the road's surface.\n\"Where go?\"\n\"Left. No, that way--left. You know left from right?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Keep going. You're doing fine.\"\nThe driver skidded to a sudden halt as they reached the outer gate. Mike climbed out of the car and paid the balance. The driver opened his window a crack to receive the money and then drove out backwards, loose gravel sweeping under the cab's tires as he gunned the motor.\nTwo men clothed in executioner's leather led him through the gates. Their uniforms betrayed no insignia denoting either rank or service. Private henchmen, Mike figured. It was all that Gardansa had left. His house was like a temple, two marble statues rising as solemn pillars, one the fool and the other an emperor. Black veins ran their full height and the three men crossed between.\nGardansa stood against the tall, ponderous door, a canopy of yellow daisies gleaming in the faint moonlight. His smooth lips curved within some determined pleasantry.\n\"General.\"\n\"Gatherer Harrison. So delightful to see you again.\" The man's eyes turned dark and saucer shaped as he laughed, his fleshy chin dangling and bouncing as he bobbed his head in welcome.\nThe house was warm and smelled of sweet perfume. Numerous busts littered the hallways, and the hearth glowed with fiery sparks rising up the chimney only to swirl back down as fine black ash. The general picked short bits of hair from his nose as they talked, flicking them into the steady stream of warm air. They wafted about in the current, occasionally catching within the thick fur of his brown fez.\n\"I am sorry to hear such dread news of your friends, but then friends come and go. That is the way of life.\"\nMike nodded, not sure how to respond.\n\"And, after all, she was a Siri. And the other one, a traitor against you. So well you pick your friends. Makes me wonder that you are still around to tell me stories.\"\nHe chuckled at some image lurking deep within his mind. It was a dry sort of noise, starting below his throat and wafting upward like the quaking of a volcano.\n\"How like the past, this seems. Traitors and psyches. One must somehow breed the other. You not agree?\"\n\"I don't know, General. I came here seeking the answer to another question.\"\n\"Ahh,\" he nodded reluctantly. \"It is an answer which I could not divulge were even I to somehow become of it aware.\"\n\"And why is that?\"\n\"Might I interest you in some brandy, Mister Harrison.\"\n\"Not tonight, General.\"\n\"You know, before you and your psyche saved my life, I never thought that I would allow an offworlder in my home. And to allow an offworlder to enter, and leave sober...now that is unthinkable.\"\nMike finally relented in the hope of placating his host. The drink was a deep crimson variety from Ares. Making brandy and building guns were the only two things they did well.\n\"You are in a very reflective mood tonight, my friend. It makes me tremble to smell such thought in my very home. And yet, mysteriously, you stay your tongue. What chains are these that hold you?\"\n\"I guess I'm just bummed out.\"\n\"Bummed out?\"\n\"This whole trip has been one disaster after another.\"\n\"Ahh...but is that not the life of the gatherer? To sacrifice and lose heart and shed all things precious only to triumph in the end. How like the life of the soldier. You and me, we are very much the same, no?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" Mike swallowed another gulp, its acidic flavor coating the length of his throat.\n\"And to die...that is the sweetest sacrifice. How more alike we seem, myself in virtual exile, and you...\"\nHe suddenly burst out with a wheezing fit of laughter, his cheeks puffing into a patronizing smile.\n\"Now that you are officially dead, your enemies will no longer be watching for you. What an advantage we have created, you and I. Cast it away, you could. We could easily arrange for your passage off-planet.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"No?\" The general's pudgy-cheeked grin melted into a bare-toothed smirk as he stared into vacant space, his eyes glazed with eager satisfaction.\n\"Then you must use your advantage, and swiftly. It will not take our enemies long to realize they have been fooled.\"\n\"You can't tell me anything about Erestyl.\"\n\"As to that, you might ask your friend, Mister Dulin. And when you see him, warn him to be more careful. It is not often on Calanna that one is granted a reprieve.\"\nMike nodded, \"I'm sure he's aware of that.\"\n\"The question, Mister Harrison, is whether or not you are.\"\nMike sucked down the last of the Aresian brandy, a sour expression crossing his face as the general grinned in approval.\n\"Someday, if you live long enough, I will teach you to drink like a true Calannan.\"\n\"Thanks, General. I think.\" Mike pulled himself upright, his bad shoulder still aching despite the numbing fluid within the cast. Gardansa reached for the bottle, his fingers fumbling at the cork as he shook his head unsympathetically.\n\"No, you must be certain.\"\n\"I'm certain... truly and without doubt. Do you have a terminal around here, by the way?\"\n\"You are quite certain?\" Gardansa prodded.\n\"Absolutely. Someday. Some other day.\"\nThe Doggie Blitz seemed to have a larger share of traffic than the night before, its electronic corridors clogging with conversation. Mike floated with the frenzy, picking up bits and pieces of conventional wisdom on the various sub-boards. It seemed word had already spread of Cecil's escape from the cellars. The lingo seemed especially prodigious at coming up with new words for various non-places.\nCecil's state was nothing more than electronic disembodiment, something about which Mike cared little and understood less. He engaged a few of the patrons on the topic, hoping to gain more information about Cecil's exact crime against the authorities, but nobody seemed to be able to agree even on the basic facts. Finally the person he was looking for appeared online.\n\"Call 143\/741\"\n\"Waiting... connect.\"\n\"You got the Spokes-man.\"\n\"Hi, you still can't help with Cecil?\"\n\"Aww, man... not you again.\" His image wavered on the screen, its contours shifting as he spat a piece of food at his terminal lens.\n\"Who else? Besides, I figured you'd be happy to see me.\"\n\"All I wanna know is how you did it.\"\n\"Check where I'm calling from.\"\n\"Hold on... Ummm...damn, out of the district. Can't get a fix. You tell me. No, wait. Let me guess. A certain General.\"\n\"Very good.\" Mike tried not to sound patronizing.\n\"Damn straight. I saw your face in more than one place last night. Figured I'd never have to look at it again, too.\"\n\"That was a little gatherer magic. It comes with knowing certain Generals and drinking whatever they put in front of your face.\"\n\"Yeah, I read up on you. Some dirty deeds. So how come you're still alive?\"\n\"Umm...that's actually a pretty good question.\" Mike rubbed his shoulder, the pain pivoting in and out of focus. \"Actually, I need you to do a little job. That is, if you're not afraid of the authorities.\"\n\"Hey, I don't follow anybody to the cellars. You can't pay me enough.\"\n\"I don't want you to go out...I want you to go in.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"A robot brain. Draconian design if I'm not missing my guess. You interested?\"\n\"Draconian. Is it sentient?\"\n\"I guess that depends on your definition.\"\n\"I'll take a look at it. Meet me at the Tiberian Compound at twenty-five cents. Suite 112J.\"\n\"I'll be there.\"\nGardansa was not a man for long good-byes. When Mike returned to the drawing room, the General was already fast asleep, snoring in his armchair as lumps of loose flesh jiggled on his chin. Within the hallways, the busts seemed to snicker with mischievous delight. The chief guard showed Mike to a polished limousine, it's black exterior coated with sheets of polymer stucco. Mike admired the invulnerability before climbing into the front seat with the driver.\n\"You speak galanglic?\"\n\"What, do I look like a taxi driver or something?\"\nCold wind swept along the limo's prow, the forelights scintillating in amber streaks as the vessel barreled against the rushing breeze. The night was crisp and clear, the celestial canopy flushed bright with a sparkling dew and far below, cool waters broke inward with the folding swell, foam lingering on the soft, white sands.\n\"You see something interesting out there?\"\n\"Huh? Oh...not really.\"\nSea birds drifted about on the quiet shore below the cliffs, their outlines vaguely visible against the light drizzle. Occasionally they'd group into pairs and then drift apart, some coasting in circles and others swooping down to the breaking tide. In the distance, a bright point of light appeared followed by the faint whining noise of a turbofan. Mike hit the stick, sending the limousine into a diving spiral. A moment later, the missile impacted on the looming cliffs, sending shrapnel and stones bouncing against the stucco.\n\"Ay!\"\nThe driver pulled out of the dive, snaking across the choppy waters as another point of light appeared.\n\"Slow down.\"\n\"Are you crazy?\"\n\"Do it.\"\nMike leapt from the limousine as it slowed, the salty water stinging his eyes as he dived beneath the waves. Suddenly, everything turned bright orange, and for a moment he thought he could see for miles beneath the sea. The explosion rippled the current like a giant's hand slapping the surface, and Mike gasped for air beneath the waves, choking on the salty fluid as it invaded his throat. When he surfaced, all that was left of the limousine was small specks of polymer stucco drifting downward with the gentle rain.\nJim's a grad-student at UC Riverside, hoping and praying like crazy that he'll get his MBA before the dean's axe gets him first.

His story, he says, is what you get when you combine an overactive imagination with the foolish tendency to wing it. He says he writes exactly the same way he gamemasters: without any semblance of plan or preconception.\nWhat has been published here as chapter seven is actually chapter eleven as written originally by Jim.

Above, the scent of sweet honey floated gently through the faint current, stirring the petals with a quiet cacophony of hushed whispers, carelessly catching the tips of her curls and caressing the thick patch of grass where she lay. The fireflies began to play, little winged faerie, or so she'd imagined. They darted about in circles, one teasingly pursuing another, while below, another host of insects went about their evening business, foraging for sustenance amid the damp, loamy terrain. They seemed dark and ominous, great pinchers perched atop their frames as they straggled about in the abject slumber of community, a congested mass, grinding together, crawling over and beneath, their limbs twisted about each other in ignoble partnership.\nA tall bell tower rose from the hillside, its chimes ringing with tempestuous abandon. Vilya watched the bell work back and forth, its clamor growing in intensity. She reached out, her arm elongating into the elastic distance as the waning light slowly settled into black.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Hi. Did I wake you up?\"\nShe groggily tried to place the voice.\n\"Johanes?\"\n\"Umm... no. Mikael.\"\n\"Oh... you.\"\n\"I need a favor,\" Mike gulped down, glad that he was too cheap to pop for a visi-link.\nThe dawn was misty and cold, precipitation gradually forming into a dense fog along the coast. Her green eyes, though not so sparkly, were a welcome sight. Mike cautiously climbed into the back seat, checking to see the driver's face.\n\"What happen?\"\n\"I decided to go swimming again.\" He stripped off his shirt, letting its ullage collect on the seat and slide in slippery droplets to the carpeted floor as the cab's warm air glided along his chest.\n\"Like cold water too well. Should hitch ride from now on... less danger.\"\nShe gave him a not-so-gentle squeeze at the end, her eyes scintillating with wicked intent as Mike's crossed involuntarily. He let out a deep groan, packaging the pain instead of striking back. \"For waking me so early,\" she finally explained, and Mike wondered if it was some new custom as he slowly recovered.\n\"That was dirty.\"\n\"Justice never clean.\"\n\"Justice? You call that justice? I'd hate to feel revenge.\"\n\"Pray you don't have to.\"\n\"Vil... I don't blame you for being mad, but I really didn't have much of a choice.\"\n\"Everyone have choice. I take you in home, I give to you food, I give to you key, and you go and you no leave scratch-marks...\"\n\"Look... I'm sorry, okay?\"\n\"No... you look...\"\nMike just nodded as she continued, her speech quickening and moving in and out of slang so fast that he could no longer keep up. He knew that the Calannan women had a way of laying the guilt pretty thick, but this one was in a class by herself.\n\"Vilya, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you, I promise. What more do you want?\"\n\"Now you want know what I want.\"\nShe produced the dodecahedron from her wet, paper bag, its black surface glimmering dimly in the scattered light.\n\"Maybe I show you, eh?\"\nOutside, the murky air rushed against her window in pael gusts, droplets of moisture forming along its plastic surface, skidding steadily toward some common goal, and finally flailing blindly into the cab's interior. Beyond, the vague shape of the cliff's edge coursed by.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"I want see how much you care for the pretty cermic. You jump for it, yes?\"\n\"Vilya... I said I was sorry.\"\n\"Say again. I no hear so well.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Eh?\"\n\"I'm sorry. How many times do you want me to say it?\"\n\"You want pretty cermic too much.\"\n\"Yeah, well... it's important.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because.\"\n\"Because why?\"\n\"It's a long story, okay?\"\n\"We seem to have long time together.\"\n\"Yeah, well I'll explain it over breakfast.\"\nShe grumbled brusquely, but Mike could tell her stomach was in favor of the notion.\n\"C'mon, I'm buying. How'd you like to eat in Xekhasmeno?\"\n\"So now I have choice...\"\nXekhasmeno was known to locals as the forgotten city, a place given away to Imperial commerce as a settlement of war. Offworld, the appropriation was viewed as a no more than a slap on the wrist, but for the Calannans, the city was a brand of shame and defeat, a place forsaken and rarely spoken of except to provide adjectives for their more colorful slang. To hate Xekhasmeno and those who dwelt within it was part of Calanna's unspoken creed, a thing as real and as often underestimated as the thin, electrical barricade which protruded around the city's borders, forbidding entrance except to Megacorp personnel and the starport authority.\nThey entered at the north-east gates beneath the Tizarian embassy. Work crews were in the process of finishing the new building. A guard wandered along the line of vehicles, knocking on windows and stamping clearance stickers on various hoods. Mike recognized him as one of the old-timers who stayed on after the incident.\n\"Identification.\"\nMike opened his window as the guard peered within, his eyes widening in surprise.\n\"Why, Mister Harri...?!\"\n\"Keep it quiet. You never saw me.\"\n\"Uhh... alright, sir. Heard you were dead.\" He whispered it as though saying so more loudly might lend it truth, eyebrows wrinkling in confusion as he backed cautiously from the taxi, waiving them through with a stamp of the sticker machine.\n\"What he say?\" Vilya was rendered oblivious by the Galanglic.\n\"Huh? Oh... he said to have a nice day.\"\n\"Nice day?\"\n\"Where to?\" The cabby's eyebrows were furrowed in mild irritation.\n\"Tyberian Compound.\"\nSuite 112J turned out to be on the ground level of a small technical complex. The suite was really more of a repair shop, and Vilya seemed altogether confused by her new surroundings. Spokes rounded a corner from the back of the room, his headgear gleaming in the fluorescent light.\n\"You're late, man.\"\n\"I ran into a little bit of trouble along the way.\" Mike handed over the dodecahedron, and Spokes inspected the casing, his blue eyes gleaming as though it were a birthday present.\n\"Bonded cermic?\"\n\"Made to look that way. It's survived quite a bit.\"\n\"I'm sure it's not the only one.\"\nSpokes said it with an air of either respect or inveiglement. Mike couldn't tell which for certain.\n\"You gonna be okay with this?\"\n\"Sure. What exactly am I supposed to be looking for?\"\n\"At this point, anything that seems interesting... if you manage to get in that is.\"\n\"Don't worry about that. It may take a little time, but I'll get in. You wanna hang around?\"\n\"I promised somebody a square meal. After that, I need to get the shoulder fixed.\"\n\"There's a cafeteria on the 3rd floor. If you're looking for something nicer, there's the starport.\"\n\"We'll hit the starport.\"\n\"Suit yourself. Oh, take this.\" He handed Mike an SPA maintenance overcoat complete with tinted-bubble hood and IR goggles. \"Unless you wanna be a celebrity, that is.\"\n\"Not after this morning; thanks.\"\nThe starport wasn't much different than he remembered it, a mishmash of technicians, cargo-hands, and jaunty, third-rate brokers strewn in pairs and trios along a sea of polished floor tile. Various shops lined the walkways between the Outworld Market and the shuttle bays. Interspersed between them, wide, circular planters rose from the gleaming tiles, forming benches for all the old people to sit. They studied the drifting masses with sardonic glares, their garish glad rags explicating a backward dive into altricial helplessness.\nMike let down the hood once they were seated in a corner of the Zardocha Cafe. He remembered it fairly well, and by some coincidence found himself at the same table he and Tara had sat at not so long ago. His shoulder began aching again as the food came, the pain sharpening as an indication that the stabilizer was failing. Vilya's mood seemed to improve as she used the gravitic waves of her utensil to thwack his wound beneath the hardened castfoam.\n\"Gee... thanks.\"\n\"Why you hurt?\"\n\"I was wondering when you were going to get around to asking me that.\"\n\"On Calanna, is impolite to ask such thing.\"\n\"Why?\"\nHer eyes seemed to search the corner of the ceiling for an answer.\n\"Is like saying you small.\"\n\"Small?\"\n\"Like baby.\"\n\"I could stand some babying.\"\nThat got her. Mike figured it was something about the language he didn't understand. Finally, she tapped the wound again with her grav-utensil, this time on a sharper focus.\n\"Ow!\"\n\"Ha! You are baby. Tell me who is Cole.\"\n\"A friend. Oww...\"\n\"Good friend?\"\n\"Not really.\"\nMike grabbed the utensil from her hand before she could cause him any more pain. She fought tenaciously for several moments, and then suddenly let go, causing him to almost topple backwards.\n\"Be careful you silly boy. Waiter?! May I have a thing to eat with other than fingers?\"\nShe turned back to Mike, her wicked smile returning as she was brought another grav-utensil.\n\"Ha ha... I win.\"\n\"Vilya, I'm not in the mood.\"\n\"Too bad... I am.\"\n\"Look, I don't want you messing with it. I'm gonna get it taken care of right after this.\"\n\"But I hate you, and I want to hurt you.\"\n\"I'm sure you do.\"\n\"Why you come to Calanna?\"\n\"I'm a tourist. I like to go sight-seeing. Ow!\"\nA couple heads turned, and Mike tried to keep his face angled toward the wall. Vilya giggled at his predicament and motioned for another stab. She was interrupted by the arrival of the food, however, and consoled herself with squirting tiny packets of bean sauce on the bubble hood of his SPA suit and the soggy shoes he'd borrowed. Mike regarded her mood with all the patience it deserved.\n\"Stop it you brat.\"\n\"Make me.\"\n\"What's the matter? You don't like the food here or something?\"\n\"They no have haggis.\"\n\"Oh wah.\"\n\"I see your face on three-vee after the work last night. It say you are dead Tizarian.\"\n\"A foul rumor that's been greatly exaggerated.\"\n\"Is that purpose you hide face?\"\n\"I told you... I'm a tourist. You calling me a liar?\"\n\"What sights you will see, tourist?\"\n\"I dunno. Maybe the coast.\"\n\"Maybe you will swim with shoes off this time?\"\nMike smiled, \"Maybe.\"\nThe starport's sick-bay seemed more like a recovery hall for low-berthers. Several stood around popping fizzies to kill their morning breath while others were slowly revived from days or weeks in cryogenic suspension. Cold sleep wasn't so bad, Mike recalled. It was the waking up part that was so unpleasant. Cole's signature bubbled away with the dissolving castfoam. The pharmacist administered the regeneration formula while a medic finished examining the wound. She held a thin fork in her hand, prodding the mesodermal layers as his blood flow slowed to a trickle.\n\"Passed right through. How'd this happen?\"\n\"It was an accident.\"\nTwo shuttle attendants brought in a dozen more of the freezerinos as a feminine voice sedately announced the new arrivals. Her tone was collected, almost dull, enunciating each syllable of their names as though they were items of inventory and not actual people. Included were a few John and Jane Does, each accorded a separate number for the ledger. Mike charged the expense to Linden's account, including an all's well message on the assessment. The nurse swathed the numb shoulder in a fresh bandage as Mike finished typing in Linden's access code.\n\"We're gonna need some ID on this.\"\n\"Check again.\"\n\"Huh? Oh... guess not. Interesting insurance you've got.\"\n\"Yeah... Bank of Chuck.\"\nVilya sat with her back against the antechamber wall, her eyes glossed over with holographic images of interstellar medical technology. The promo featured minimalist cybernetics, nothing too scary or complex yet still fascinating for the uninitiated.\n\"Fixed?\"\n\"Yeah... I guess.\"\nThey exited through baggage claims, climbing into a tram on the way out. Spokes was still fiddling with the dodec when they returned. He wore a staid expression, his eyes narrowing to thin slits as they entered.\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\"You see these things?\"\nHe pointed to two sets of bulbs at the base of his jacks, half of them shattered and fused.\n\"What about 'em?\"\n\"Electrical inhibitors... without which my brain would be a toasty critter. The overload wiped my entire deck.\"\n\"I had no idea,\" Mike tried to make it sound sincere.\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\"What did you find out?\"\n\"It tried to fry me is what I found out.\"\n\"Immediately?\"\n\"It asked for some kind of ID clearance. I tried to burn out the active circuits, and it gave me auto-feedback except about ten times stronger than what I flushed in.\"\n\"So in other words it fought back.\"\n\"To put it mildly.\"\n\"Well, what did you expect, a cakewalk?\" Mike tried to churn up a wholesome expression.\n\"I expect you to pay me four thousand for new inhibitors and software, credits not drin.\"\n\"No money until you get in.\"\n\"I almost got torched, Harrison! I think that qualifies me for working expenses.\"\n\"I'll try to get you the money.\"\nSpokes turned and looked away, his eyes following a long, jagged crack in the wall plaster.\n\"Really hope you're joking, man.\"\n\"Finances are a little tight right now. It occasionally happens when you die, but I'll get the money somehow. Don't worry about that.\"\nSpokes smiled, \"I won't. I'll be keeping darkie as collateral until you do.\"\nMike considered the proposition, wondering if he had a choice in the matter.\n\"Spokes, I'm not trying to rip you off.\"\n\"Nor I you, Mister Harrison, but if you want trust, you're gonna have to show some in return.\"\nMike found himself nodding, almost stupidly, like some Joe Public listening to the big-time politician. Vilya sat idle, ignoring the Galanglic, her eyes casually roaming the technical hardware. Somewhere above her head, the blades of a humidifier kicked in, and a sudden current of musty air bathed her dark hair within its cool, transparent tendrils. She looked upward, squinting. The tall shaft rose above her, dark and imposing, lending a slight echo to their voices.\n\"Whatever.\"\n\"What are you trying to get out of this thing anyway?\"\n\"It's a little hard to explain.\"\n\"Try me.\"\nMike took a deep breath, the musty air sucking through his nostrils.\n\"This thing, as you call it, was once the brain of a Draconian android. Her name was Robin, and she served what I believe was a sleeper agent sent to work for the Galactican before she got... somewhat dismembered... by this former friend of mine who decided to start working for the Imperials. For some reason, she decided not to wipe her memory, maybe because she wanted somebody to look at it. I don't know.\"\n\"I take it this is gonna be a long story.\"\nMike nodded, apologetically.\n\"The Imps have gotten their hands on one of my... subjects, for lack of a better word. He seems to be rather important to both them and the Draconians, and I'd just like to find out why.\"\n\"What's his name?\"\n\"They call him Erestyl.\"\n\"What do you call him?\"\n\"When I found him, he didn't have a name. His brain had been mangled by an Imperial mind-scanner. He didn't know who or what he was. The SPA found him in a galley stabbing people with a fork, one of the non-gravitic kinds you sometimes find in starport medical bays. He was transported to a local facility on Tizar and was snatched back by ISIS and brought here.\"\n\"ISIS? On Calanna?\"\n\"I know. It makes no sense. If he was a criminal, I'd maybe have expected them to take him to the 47th. Instead, they opted for secrecy, even from their own people.\"\n\"Where does he come from?\"\n\"Unknown. He was shipped to Tizar in a low berth. Another John Doe... transported on some tramp freighter that was no longer in port.\"\n\"And you feel it's your occupational duty to get involved.\"\nMike shrugged, \"We dropped in five days ago. Me, Robin, and two others. Air defense was alerted to our mission. They destroyed the ship, and to make a long story short, me and this hunk of cermic are all that's left.\"\n\"Does ISIS know you're still alive?\"\n\"I had a little run-in with them this morning outside Gardansa's. I'd hoped it might be safe, seeing as how I'm supposed to be dead and all, but apparently not.\"\n\"And who's the woman?\"\n\"A friend. Native.\"\n\"Obviously.\"\n\"I've been encircled ever since I got here. I needed a safe place to stay.\"\n\"Get a flat.\"\n\"I'm a little short on funds right now.\"\n\"Does she even know anything about this?\"\n\"She knows something strange is going on. That's about it.\"\nSpokes winced, his eyes darting between them as an awkward smirk played across his lips.\n\"That's cold.\"\n\"I've made more than my share of mistakes on this drop. If I get caught, anybody who knows anything about what's goin' on is gonna be fair game.\"\n\"Oh... you're a real hero.\"\n\"If I disappear, I'd rather she just think I got up and vanished.\"\n\"Well thanks for telling me all about it, Harrison. That's just was I need... a bunch of offworld police homing in on me.\"\n\"You're the one who wanted trust. Besides, why should I care what happens to you? You're nothin' to me... except... maybe a possibility.\"\n\"A possibility to get yourself killed.\"\n\"I need your help to get this brain cracked. If you wanna bail out, I'll take Robin and leave right now. You can bill the Galactican, but you'll never hear from me again.\"\n\"And what if I decide to stick my neck out for you? What do I get?\"\n\"The Galactican will cover your expenses. Maybe with luck you'll be able to land a cushy job there, I dunno.\"\n\"Weak.\"\n\"Yeah, but right now it's about all I can promise.\"\nSpokes backed away from the dodec, his shoulders slumped and eyes wandering the walls. Mike tried to read his posture, the movement of the bony ends of his elbows as they scraped against the desk. Mike rubbed his temples, exhausted from the long night.\n\"Look, it doesn't take a genius to realize something very strange is going on. If we can find out what it is... who knows?\"\n\"I'd like to help you, Harrison. But what you're doing is dumb.\"\n\"What would you have me do?\"\n\"Back off. Get uninvolved. If I was you, I'd make a beeline for Tizar and forget this whole thing ever happened.\"\n\"Spokes... the key to this `whole thing' could be sitting right in front of our noses... literally.\"\n\"So that you can write a story about it or get yourself martyred?\"\nSpokes shook his head, his scowl softening into a dreary stare as the dodec's black surface glimmered in the dim, artificial light. Once again in Mike's possession, its surface felt icy cold, as if the recent skirmish had plunged her into some deep, cryogenic dream. Spokes wandered to the back of his workshop, his head still shaking in mild contempt. Outside, Calanna's great red sun bathed the forgotten city in hues of amber and gold. Vilya said nothing, somber, green eyes speculating as to the mood of the alien conversation.\nThe ride back to Xin passed quickly. Their driver was a old man, apparently from the local area. He assumed they were tourists, who had become increasingly common since the post-war domestication. He pointed out various roadside landmarks as he drove, switching back and forth between Galanglic and Calannic and occasionally a mishmashed fusion of the two. Vilya remained silent for most of the ride, only speaking near the end to correct of minor point of history.\n\"You make good story, but that is not how it happen.\"\n\"No?\" The driver's deep brown nose wrinkled in embarrassment.\n\"Varilion is no crafty as you say. It was Priestess of Snagarth that give him idea.\"\n\"Ha! Why should the Priestess care about Imperial garrison? Eh?\"\n\"She not care, such as negrali mind own business. They refuse this courtesy, to pillage her temple and to murder her harem, that she make revenge.\n\"Ah... the lady is of the light.\"\n\"The light?\" Mike inquired.\n\"She is Calannan, yes?\"\n\"What do you think, Vil? You of the light?\"\nShe shot Mike a sidelong glance, amusement brewing within anger.\n\"What you know of the light, Mikael?\"\n\"What should I know?\"\nThe driver's voice broke into a hearty, belly laugh, the cab weaving and bouncing with the spasms of his merriment. Vilya concentrated her gaze out the window. The sun's thick rays seemed to fall down as crimson shingles, baked and plastered along the dry, ruddy terrain.\n\"You children are pleasant, but where to go?\"\n\"Take us to Erfalas.\"\n\"Hah! Good choice.\"\nThe cab snaked around the back roads of Xin's underbelly, crossing the highway to Pinnath Carach and continuing coastward. The air grew perceptibly cooler, and Mike spotted a flock of gulls on the horizon.\n\"Hey Vil... where're we going?\"\n\"Erfalas. You like it, trust me.\"\nThe road came to an abrupt halt at the edge of a long rocky bluff. Forty feet below, the waves bore past beds of green kelp and red coral, shooting headlong into the stony grey cliffs. Beyond, the blue sea, Aeluin, stretched past the buoyant sudd, extending to infinity, its waters sweet and young, curling softly into the expansive horizon as they kissed the crystal sky, their colors shared, mixed together in some strange yet benevolent duet.\nEvery liter was similar in chemistry, undulating together beneath cool sheets of air, but where the water touched the shore, so it assumed it's character, relentlessly hammering the broad cliffs, foaming against the lush coral, and settling quietly along the flat, sandy shores. Aeluin was young by geologic standards, bearing only a tenth the salinity of Tizar's ocean, safe for drinking in the short term and unmolested by the pollutants many other civilizations had carelessly scattered.\nVilya began descending the sheer face, her movements unusually agile, as though she'd memorized the rock's most minute features. Mike followed, taking arduous care to mimic her steps and holds. He'd climbed rocks on Tizar, but never without gravitic momentum restrainers. Minus the security, he felt strangely naked, his nerves jittery and clumsy while a cool perspiration broke along his hairline. Dozens of steel eyehooks cut into the stone just above the water line. Vilya rested on one of them, allowing sprinkles of foam to catch in her long, dark hair.\n\"Why are we here?\"\n\"Sightseeing.\"\n\"Oh... right.\"\n\"Give me hand.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Give.\"\nMike stretched out his arm, and her thin fingers wrapped gracefully around his wrist. She tugged for a moment, and suddenly he was slipping, flailing against the stone to regain his balance as he toppled backwards. In an instant, he found himself hanging by a pair of cuffs firmly secured from his wrist to an eyehook.\n\"Vilya!?\"\n\"You always such easy to snare?\"\nHe cursed as the steel cuff bit into the flesh of his wrist. Frantically, he scratched at the wet rock beneath, his borrowed shoes nearly falling off his feet as the waves came crashing in, pulverizing his legs against the stone. Mike clawed with his free arm, still bandaged, for a nook in the rock on which to hold while Vilya watched, unsympathetically, her eyebrows arched in contemplation of something devious. Finally, she spoke, her words following fluidly with the rushing waves.\n\"After war, the Count of Tyber make to crush Calanna of her pride. He take her children and chain them here. For long day, they thirst, and Aeluin is at the stomachs of them. But when the sun sit down, Aeluin rise up to mouths and noses and drown them.\"\n\"Thanks for the guided history tour. Will you please let me out of these?\"\n\"The light keep life that darkness take. Thus is why Calanna consent to domestication.\"\n\"Vil...\"\n\"Are you so full of the pride you cannot say the travel of you? What is secret that shame you?\"\n\"It's a long story.\"\n\"Is long time tonight.\"\nMike tried to grab her with his numb arm, but its movement was too clumsy and slow, his grip on the cliff's face failing again. He finally gave in to gravity as the waves pushed his legs into the grey stone.\n\"Okay. I'll tell you, but not now. Not like this.\"\n\"You have choice?\"\n\"I can ask please, can't I?\"\nShe smiled, a mischievous sparkle entering her continence.\n\"You look so sad... you are ticklish?\"\n\"Vil!\"\n\"Tell all... or suffer fate worse than castration.\"\nThe climb back went more quickly than the coming down, and Mike managed his release without getting into the gory details of his travels. In fact, he'd told her fairly little, and yet she seemed already to understand everything, asking only those questions which were necessary. Even his mention of the Imperial police didn't faze her, nor his mention of the Draconian robot brain. She simply listened as though he were going through motions which were without consequence.\nWhen they returned to the cab, the old man asked earnestly whether or not they had seen the light. Vilya's smile seemed to confirm the suspicion, and she generously popped for the fare as they pulled up to her small flat in Xin.\nThe cat was nowhere to be found, but a warm breeze blew through the red twill curtains betraying his escape. Outside, the hot afternoon sun seemed to bleach all color from the sky, mysterious grey clouds mixing with the amber-blond vapors billowing in lumpy puffs from the tall, black smokestacks of the inner-city. Mike half expected her to throw him out as she pulled a small taser from her pocket. Instead, she set it, with the cuffs, in a bedside drawer before falling roughly on the center of the sheets. Mike wondered if it was an invitation or a dismissal.\n\"When are you going to work?\"\n\"Tonight. If I wake.\"\nShe turned to the alarm counter and set it forward twenty cents.\n\"I not know that I want to go.\"\n\"How long have you had that job?\"\n\"Too long.\"\nMike sat at the edge of the bed, kicking off his water-logged shoes. He stretched the top sheet over her, and allowed his fingers to brush quietly through the soft ends of her hair.\n\"You don't like it?\"\n\"I not like being groped by strangers.\"\n\"Hmm... wake me up before you leave.\"\nMike crashed on the couch in front of the three-vee, the muscles in his shoulders loosening as he closed his eyes and tried to feel the onset of sleep. The sweltering heat closed upon him quietly, forming moist patches of perspiration on his chest and forehead and beneath his knees. He threw off his shirt and pants, turning over several times, ignoring the little bits of food particles in the cushions which stuck to his skin. Outside, he could here a wryneck, hissing as it darted from the window.\nThe cat sneaked inside several minutes later, meticulously licking its fur in front of the couch. Mike listened as it scratched on her door and was promptly allowed entrance. He tried to suppress the slight twinge of envy as the sweat continued to gather, slowly, finally cooling as it evaporated into the thick, clammy air.\nIn the back of his mind, he could hear the clicking of hundreds of keyboards and the cluttered conversations of dozens of gatherers on the Galactican's main floor. Linden sat in his huge leather chair in the central office, his entire body tilted backward, reading the obituaries column. He came across a name he recognized, circling it with a lightpen as he hit a cut and paste macro with his left hand. Into his scrapbook it went, along with all the others.\n\"You know what I like about you kid? Persistence. You keep coming back.\"\nHe should have called it luck, a strange kind of luck that forgives all mistakes and then comes slapping you back in the face when you least expect it. His father had called it the luck of the space cadet. The cat continued licking its fur, its yellow eyes searching his, forming accusations as they met somewhere in the space between, animal and human; they were not so different. It curled its head backward to lick a spot on the back of its neck, but the head just kept going around and around as though it didn't matter.\nIts feet were coated in a soft, white sand which it spread about the carpet. Outside, the surf swept up toward the windows, rushing through the cracks in the seams as the roof began to leak, water dripping from a thousand tiny holes, all scattered about. He could only watch, immobile, as the water sloshed around him, pressing over his nose and mouth in warm trickles. It tasted vaguely salty, and he battled to spit it away before realizing that he no longer needed air to breathe, and the cat swam freely, its instinctive fear reduced to an occasional `Hissssss....'\nHe woke, drenched by a slick envelop of oily sweat. The evening was likewise coated in a murky haze, and Vilya was gone, save for a note stuck in the crack of her bedroom door. It said he looked peaceful, too peaceful to waken. Mike clumped the flimsi-leaf into a ball, and tossed in on the kitchen counter. The cupboards were empty save for a moldy loaf of rye and two cans of prickly nopal sauce. The flimsi slowly unfolded of its own volition, the luminescent Calannic flickering across its surface. Mike pressed the corner, releasing the message into electronic oblivion.\n\"Show contents.\"\n\"Done.\"\nNothing?\n\"Retrieve all.\"\n\"Done.\"\n\"Show contents.\"\n\"Unnamed-1. Done.\"\n\"Read Unnamed-11.\"\nVilya's message returned to the leaf, her tall, slanted letters seeming to mock him as he read it again.\n\"Set date by age reversed.\"\n\"Done.\"\n\"Show history.\"\n\"Manufacture: 01.149.968. Last initialization: 01.149.968. Done.\"\nIn the shower, Mike wondered what sort of girl would have a flimsi-leaf for over a year and save something to it only once. The cool water flowed smoothly over his body, falling in dirty puddles to the yellow-stained porcelain tiles. The pipes equeaked sternly, and Mike imagined the sound rustling through the entire flat. He shuffled into his smelly pants and shirt and the pair of shoes he was still borrowing, pocketing the flimsi and Bill's body pistol as an afterthought.\nThe evening had descended into night, and the dark purple sky glittered with spangles of illumination. The streets were fluid with movement, motor cars weaving carelessly around the herds of pedestrians like a pack of hungry wolves as volumes of voids and pleasure junkies sat fidgeting in the gutters, playfully groping the wires which pumped streams of electric illusion into their skulls. The food vendors engaged in fierce shouting matches across the streets, defaming each other's culinary creations while exclaiming the virtues of their own.\n\"Lissi mituvoreva!\"\n\"Git yer stinkin' paws off me, ya weirdo.\"\n\"Hey... you wanna echailmet some ywalme?\"\n\"Hirer quaggahaggis!\"\n\"Haggis?\"\n\"Try it. Viuvalye, yes?\"\n\"Two please.\"\nTraffic on the underway was fairly busy going down, and Mike felt lucky to find a seat. He set the two thermoplastic containers between his legs, the thick scent of stewed meat rising to his nostrils as the tram rattled along its narrow course. A bloody-nosed teenager stood in the center of the aisle, his lips puckered as he whistled some ancient melody with meticulous precision. He held his dirty, brown mug with a jittery grip, and drooped over his back was a large, canvas bag. Inside the bag sat an elderly, legless man, with a black, conductor's baton and a pair of painted-out spectacles. Each instant a note fell from place, the man slapped his stick sharply across the boy's face, angrily cursing the younger's stupidity as he continued to wave the baton around like a deadly sabre. Occasionally, the man's face glowed with appreciation when he heard a clink from the mug. Then he mumbled a few kind words in a hoarse voice regarding generosity and alms for the poor, smacking the boy's ear to make him shut-up and then cracking him across the blue welts on the back of his neck to summon forth another round of profitable music.\nA wide-screened viewer sat blankly in the corner, its glass window shattered and half its speakers inoperable. Beneath the boy's sporadic whistling, the vague din of casual muttering, and the tram's sharp rattles, a faint, monotonous voice loomed somewhere in the distance, clear and without all the slang structures and difficult intonations so familiar to spoken Calannic.\n\"...Gardansa had no comment, except to state that his unknown assassins had obviously failed. The site of the wreckage was examined this morning by police investigators, and the remains of at least one body were discovered. Zared Dir, a local fisherman, was driving his motorbike along this cliff when the incident occurred. ...`and I see dis great ball of fire on da cliffs, and da noise is someding awful, and den dis aircar droop down to da water and someding fall out, and den da car ekzplode into dousand pieces and'....\"\nMike hopped on the rollers as the tram drew to a halt, logging the Temple as his destination and allowing the slavebot's traffic computer to choose the most appropriate route. He found himself weaving around the main channel, narrowly avoiding the other rollers before being deposited in front of the Temple's wide, phallic arches, their peculiar decor never failing to entice newcomers. The receptionist was a young man with soft, ill-defined features. He handed wrist locators to a pair of girls who could not have been older than sixteen and then neatly unfolded their wad of drin as they hurried past him, down the staircase and to the lockers below.\n\"Welcome to the Temple of the Wrything Mermaid. You make visit us before?\"\n\"Yeah... I'm bringing some dinner for a friend who works here.\"\n\"Employee?\"\n\"Is that all right?\"\n\"Is the employee name?\"\n\"Vilya.\"\nHe shot Mike a strange glance. \"I no think such person work here. You certain you have correct....\"\n\"Positive.\"\nHe tagged several keys on his computer console, smiling as he discovered the name.\n\"Ahh... she apparently is new, yes?\"\n\"I don't think so.\"\nHe swiveled the console toward Mike. Vilya's picture sat in the upper left hand corner beside various employment statistics.\n\"She was hired yesterday?\"\n\"No hired, she volunteer. Is custom to get job, you know. There is problem?\"\nMike shrugged, uncertain.\n\"When yesterday?\"\n\"You go, and you ask her... go in. No jump in water.\"\nMike hesitated, fear wrapping slowly around his mind like some blurry sort of hunch.\n\"Do you have a service entrance?\"\n\"Yes, but is no need, you see...\"\n\"All I really need to do is drop this off.\"\n\"You able to see her from the ledge, right that way.\"\n\"Well, it's actually sort of a surprise.\"\n\"Surprise?\"\n\"Uhh... yeah, special occasion.\"\nThe receptionist's eyes inspected Mike with a stare both deliberate and curious.\n\"Is against rules.\"\n\"Well, if you don't have the authority...\"\n\"No... of course I can, but... have we meet before?\"\nMike smiled, \"I don't think so....\"\n\"Yes... I see your face on three-vee. You are in entertainment?\"\n\"Well,\" Mike shrugged, \"some folks call it that. I prefer to think of it as organized gossip.\"\n\"You are the famous gatherer. Now I remember. Harrison, yes? I must have autograph. My sister reads all the scratch marks of you.\"\nThe employees' entrance was around the side of the structure, down a hallway which was itself nestled between a series of old maintenance supply rooms. The receptionist walked with a jaunty air, unlocking the door with a twirl of his wrist as though he were showing off for somebody. Inside, three employees worked the central office controlling water conditions, accounting for nightly revenues, and watching some sort of location monitor on the far wall while taking turns receiving calls and eating from a pile of stale pastries. A young woman in a black one-piece walked purposefully down the corridor carrying a large bottle in her left hand.\n\"Justin says Mister Antonius is asking for kirsch, and the tap's just about dry.\"\n\"Oh... real emergency, eh, Pauli?\"\n\"Get some.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Anywhere and fast. Also, Corlissa says her receiver's getting kind of funky.\"\n\"Pauli... here's another. Say to her someone is lost in gallery again.\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"Miles... what are you doing down here?\"\n\"I take breather. This gentleman asks to see new girl...ah...Vilya.\"\n\"Right this way.\"\nMike followed her back along the corridor. She slowed down to look at him again, an air of concern crossing her eyes.\n\"Have I seen you before?\"\n\"Perhaps... I was here last night.\"\n\"Ah, then you must be the gentleman friend who brought Vilya here last night. I must admit, she certainly has a talent for the gravitics.\"\n\"Really....\"\n\"I've never seen anyone take as swiftly to zero-gee as she has. And as for finding her way around the caverns... you know she followed some poor fool into the gallery last night. We thought we'd have to talk her out, but she brought him right out without so much as a moment's indecision.\"\n\"She's a good learner.\"\n\"Where did she meet you? You must be foreign.\"\nMike paused at a cross-section in the corridor, the right passage lined with machinery rooms and the left descending into a staircase.\n\"I'm visiting a friend. You sound as though you're from off-planet yourself.\nShe smiled, \"My accent is that bad?\"\n\"No. Not at all.\"\nWhen it came to Calannic, Mike figured that there were two varieties, that which was theoretical and that which was actual. The same could be said of many other languages, except that with Calannic the discrepancy was particularly pronounced and often varied with respect to region. It was the natural result when a government failed to standardize education.\nThe corridor ended in two, broad-swinging doors. A cacophony of laughter and music could be heard seeping in from the other side, and Mike paused as the woman swept the doors open, peering from around her shoulder to orient himself with respect to the main entrance. She turned slightly when she realized that he wasn't following.\n\"You don't want to come in?\"\n\"Bring her to me. It's a surprise.\"\nThe doors swept open again, and Mike fixed his eyes toward the main entrance and the wide corridor stretching to the receptionist's desk. A thin mist permeated the space between, diffuse streams of purple and amber bathing the small, round tables squatting between the large hexagonal planters. Dozens of people sat clothed and not-so-clothed, sipping their drinks and occasionally diving from the terrace, through a series of gravity nullifiers and into the pool below. Some jumped in teams, crashing into each other on the way down, using the fractures in the null-gravity to practice a little impromptu acrobatics to the delight of the spectators and even the light clutter of guards lining the walls.\nExcept one. She sat with her back against the wall, her long, white mane drenched within the thick vapor. A scowl crossed her lips as she watched the main entrance, unblinking, and Mike knew he'd seen her before.\nThe doors slapped shut after a moment's wavering, and Mike backed away toward the cross-section in the corridor. The short, cement staircase dropped to a green door, its paint peeling away in the humidity. A steam drenched window was built into its frame, clear beads of water cutting jagged lines in the fog. Mike stepped cautiously down the staircase and peered within. Long rows of lockers occupied the floor space, as both men and women changed into and out of their clothes. Some distance away, a man sat within eye shot of the room's foyer, one hand casually resting within the baggy pocket of his waterlogged coat.\nMike retreated up the staircase, reaching the cross-section as Vilya emerged between the wide, double doors. For a moment, she stood silent, a strange smile forming on her lips as she saw the takeout containers dangling limp from each of his hands.\n\"This is great surprise?\"\n\"I'd figured you might be hungry....\"\nShe approached him, still dripping from the pools. Mike let his hand fall to the back of his pants, gulping down a lump of air as the body pistol's fiberglass frame became vaguely tangible beneath the thin fabric of his shirt.\n\"That's far enough.\"\nVilya stopped, her smile giving way to a blank expression as she began to open her mouth. Mike drew the gun, cocking the barrel as he centered he aim.\n\"You scream, and I'll blow you away.\"\n\"What is matter?\"\n\"Just tell me who's side you're on, Vil.\"\n\"What you are talking about?\"\n\"No more bullshit. Don't even move.\"\nHer eyes seemed to glaze over with a moment's uncertainty, and then she smiled, almost comically.\n\"This is Tizarian joke, yes?\"\n\"No, this is ISIS joke. Now you either tell me what the hell is going on, or I pull this trigger and send your brains flying in ten different directions.\"\nThe doors behind her suddenly swung open. It was Pauli, a sedentary expression glazed on her face, until she saw the gun.\n\"Guards!!!\"\nWhile he isn't writing verbose and convoluted sentences or studying for his MBA, Jim can be found gleefully stuffing bushels of ckicken-flavored Raman noodles down the bottomless esophagi of his merry band of Californian role-players.

He didn't know the rules. So when a robot refused to listen to orders he naturally attempted to repair it himself. That was a big mistake.\nHe awoke on a Tuesday morning, when the reddish glow of Vitgar's binary suns melted through the flimsy curtains on his apartment window. When he sat up on the couch his keys and an empty can of beer fell off his lap onto the floor. He rubbed his eyes and looked around. The small apartment was well furnished. A comfortable chair sat in one corner, lace doilies covering all the right places, his exhausted tweed jacket hanging limply over one arm. Bookshelves lined the walls opposite the couch, giving shelter to many familiar authors: Milton, James, Poe, Vonnegut....The other walls were decorated with various objets d'art, of which Patterson only recognized a black and white lithograph by Escher, a pair of hands drawing themselves. The place did not make him think of anywhere in particular, but there was something familiar about it, and for the first time in many years Patterson felt at home.\nWhen he got up for a cup of coffee the scene in the kitchen reminded of the previous night's dismal fiasco. The robot was strewn in a dozen pieces all over the kitchen table. Its great metal torso was propped up against the wall, assorted limbs and circuits tossed about the surface of the table like so many chessmen in a game played by amateurs. Some stale coffee and an open box of donut crumbs sulked beneath a pile of wires and hoses in one corner. In the center of the furious mess sat a lonely black box adorned with tubing and membranes. It was surrounded on all sides by curious probing electronic test equipment. Once, it was the robot's motor control center. Now it was just a box.\nPatterson sat down at the table and folded his arms around the chaos he had created. The robot, Harley Vlondee, had greeted him when he entered the apartment with a warm handshake and a friendly introduction as his personal valet. As Patterson felt he needed neither a valet nor a robot pal, he dismissed Harley as politely as he could. The robot insisted, bringing Patterson a plate of hors d'oeuvres. Patterson declined again, gently pushing the plate and the robot away.\n\"Look, I don't need you,\" he said. \"Please go away and turn off.\"\n\"I don't turn off, Mr. Patterson,\" Harley replied, \"I am here to serve you. If you do not need anything now, I shall wait in my room.\"\n\"I don't need anything now, and I won't need anything at all from you while I'm here.\"\n\"Please, Mr. Patterson,\" The robot adopted a somewhat condescending tone, \"I know our customs are unfamiliar to you, but there is no reason to be impolite. We have done everything we can to make your stay here comfortable. Please do not re- turn the favor with rudeness.\"\nPatterson didn't think he was being rude. After all, he knew you can't be impolite to a machine. As the robot did not seem to be listening to his commands, he walked over to it and started looking for the power switch.\n\"Mr. Patterson, what are you doing?\"\n\"I am going to turn you off.\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" the robot snorted, \"I don't turn off any more than you do. Please do not touch me.\"\n\"What do you mean, you don't turn off? Every droid has a switch.\"\n\"You clearly don't understand,\" the robot's voice sounded indignant, \"You may have similar creatures on your planet, Mr. Patterson, who are mere hulking, unconscious assemblages of metal. But I assure you, I am as sentient as you are.\" Harley Vlondee recoiled from Patterson's fingers. \"PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ME.\"\nPatterson lifted the robot's shirt and found a single phillips-head screw in the middle of its torso. Harley's metal frame was covered with a clammy synthetic that was kept warm by an internal heating system. It did not feel like skin at all.\n\"I'll go get a screwdriver.\"\nHorrified, now, Vlondee began to shout, \"You will not get a screwdriver or any other implement! If you continue, Mr. Patterson, I shall have to call the Authorities!\"\nPatterson came back from his bedroom, screwdriver in hand, and headed towards the robot.\n\"You know,\" Patterson continued, brandishing the screwdriver, \"where I come from they've almost entirely phased out the lower droid series. We found we just don't need them anymore. Now, if you ask me, I would rather be switched off nice and quick than allowed to wear out over time. It's a much more dignified way to go, don't you think?\"\nVlondee backed into a corner and trembled. Patterson came forward and managed to grab the tail of the droid's shirt. He tried desperately to hold the robot still so he could get good leverage on the screw in its belly. In the ensuing struggle Vlondee's arms flailed in every direction and he emitted strained, aristocratic cries of \"Help!\" and \"Desist, immediately!\" At some point, and Patterson couldn't quite remember how this happened, the screwdriver pierced the counterfeit skin and made a sickening clanking sound, coming into contact with something deep inside, at which point Harley Vlondee stopped moving. Forever.\nPatterson stood still for a full minute and then murmured, \"Oh, shit.\"\nHe knew he had broken something crucial inside the suddenly defunct valet. He dragged the silent form into the kitchen and mounted it on top of the table. The screwdriver wiggled in the android's torso, and a small rivulet of clear, smelly fluid seeped out of the murderous hole. Patterson began his futile effort at repairing the thing at once.\nThat was six hours and a long nap ago.\nReluctantly, Patterson looked up from the table, stretched one arm out over the scattered body parts, and lightly touched the video screen on the wall. He really didn't want to tell anybody what he had done. It was supremely embarassing. But his guilty conscience was getting to him. Patterson wasn't the type to break things in hotel rooms. He had never even stolen a towel.\nThe video screen came alive with colors and symbols. Then, the face of his business associate appeared, smiling warmly.\n\"Hello, my friend,\" the face said. Sovhavn was wearing the traditional turban and loose fitting kimono of his people. Behind him Patterson could see various horrifying particulars of the Vitgarian's household. \"What can I do for you this afternoon?\"\n\"Hello, Sovhavn. I think I need some help.\" Patterson was not quite sure how his associate would react when he told him he had dismantled part of his welcoming party. Nevertheless, this man was the only person he knew well enough to call.\n\"I've had some trouble with my robot valet, um...`Harley'.\"\n\"Trouble? What sort of trouble?\"\n\"I can't put it back together.\"\nSovhavn's face dropped. His eyes widened, his jaw loosened and where there had been a diplomatic, almost sincere smile of affection a blank, uncomprehending stare took over.\n\"You...what?\"\n\"Well, you see,\" Patterson started stuttering. He always stuttered when he sensed he was in trouble. And he was quite sure now that he had committed a serious faux pas. He could only hope that Svhavn would write him off as an ignorant tourist. \"I didn't want to...to...b-break it, just turn it off for a while. Then it l-lunged at me and I had a screwdriv-verer in my hand so I--\"\n\"Don't move. I'll be right over.\" Sovhavn disappeared and the video screen went blank.\nPatterson slumped into one of the kitchen chairs.\nTwenty minutes later the doorbell rang and Patterson lead Sovhavn into the kitchen.\n\"Bad. Very bad.\" There was a squeaky, metallic tone to Sovhavn's voice that Patterson didn't like at all.\n\"Can you help me put him back together?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"But I'm sure with a few spare p-parts it'll be as g-good as new.\"\n\"This is a very bad...cannot rectify.\" Sovhavn, who had been standing stiffly in the doorway, stepped forward into the kitchen. He shuddered and stopped. His face assumed an officious expression.\n\"Look,\" Sovhavn continued, \"I am afraid we cannot offer you a lawyer in this case. You may call your consulate if you wish, but I am not sure they will be able to help you, either.\"\n\"Lawyer? Case? What, are you going to sue me?\"\nSovhavn turned and faced the incredulous visitor. His demeanor had changed entirely. His motions were no longer fluid and diplomatic. They were stiff and precise. His language was still formal, but the tone had become menacing.\n\"No, sir,\" he said without blinking, \"we are going to charge you with murder.\" And with that, he walked out.\nThe next day, Nickolas R. Patterson sat bewildered and humble in the center of the huge vaulted chamber of the Vitgarian Authority, Marnjestabl Branch. Hundreds of Vitgarians fluttered about, carrying papers, scurrying back and forth, talking amongst themselves. Occasionally someone addressed him from across the hall, sending embarrassing echoes of his name into seemingly infinite reverberations among the stone walls and stained-glass windows, or came up to the circular enclosure where he sat on a straight backed chair surrounded by two armed guards and whispered closely in his ear, \"Name? Visa? Plea?\"\n\"Plea?\" Patterson was more than a little annoyed. He had been to Earth, where murder is barely a punishable offense, to Bennington's Planet where everyone is a vegitarian, to Colony IX, where there are only six (barely sentient) human beings monitoring an entire planet of machines which churn out sixteen million metric tons of synthetic corn-flakes daily--feeding the galaxy's hungry. Never had he encountered a race of people who consider the dismemberment of an automaton to be murder.\nEventually, the hall became quiet as the flurry of people and papers settled down into their respective chairs and briefcases like leaves falling into a neat little pile. Patterson anxiously glanced around the room at the many heavy wooden tables looking for a familiar face. Sovhavn was nowhere to be found.\nEveryone's eyes turned towards a huge podium in a corner of the room. It was set higher than the rest of the tables, and two or three stairs lead up to a small platform. A door opened and a quaintly dressed Vitgarian climbed up those stairs. Patterson assumed he was the Judge. He wore a colorful tripterous headdress adorned with the feathers of a rare local bird. Over his expensive royal-blue kimono he wore a fur-lined cape that reached from his shoulders to the ground. As he ascended the podium he cast a menacing glance in Patterson's direction.\nAt the bottom of the podium, the baliff swept an evangelical hand into the communal space. \"Awyee, awyee, come hither unto the great hall of adjudication and hasten the course of justice. The prisoner stands accused of murder. Let all those who will prosecute or defend assemble and put themselves to the task.\"\nThe Judge shuffled some papers, leaned back in his chair, and cleared his throat. \"Will the Prosecutor please step forward.\"\nA general excitement again rose in the hall as hundreds of papers were rearranged and the assembly muttered sotto voce. A door opened behind the podium where the Judge sat. The man who walked through it into the chamber was Sovhavn. He passed the enclosure where Patterson was sitting but did not look at him. He sat down at a desk with three other men and said, \"I am ready.\"\nPatterson wanted to reach out to Sovhavn. He wanted him to give it up, to say it really was all a joke. Patterson wondered, was Sovhavn trying to see how far he could be pushed before he would cry \"uncle?\" But Sovavn just sat at his desk, shuffling papers and looking like a formidable opponent in this all too real legal battle.\nThe Judge said, \"State your case, Prosecutor.\"\nSovhavn stood. He looked down at his desk, took a deep breath and began to speak. \"Mr. Patterson, it seems you have a lot to learn about life. I don't just mean your life, the puny collection of mistakes that carries you through from birth to death. I mean the juice that flows through everything from a squid to an elephant, the distinction between inert and blessed matter. The actions that brought you here today are the result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of life.\n\"You acted embarrassed when you told me you had 'broken' Harley Vlondee, and you called me over to help you out. But you had no idea why I was so upset when I was confronted with that scene in your kitchen. I bet you still don't know.\n\"Mr. Patterson, have you ever heard of organomechanical systems?\"\nPatterson shook his head.\n\"Organomechanical systems are living creatures whose gestation occurs entirely externally to any other organic being. They are made up of a combination of mechanical and organic parts, and are in many ways superior to normal organic systems because they are less susceptible to disease and fatigue.\"\n\"You may be wondering why this is relevant to the case. It is relevant because all Vitgarians are organomechanical.\"\n\"You mean you're all--\"\n\"Robots,\" Sovhavn said. \"We're not robots in the way you're used to thinking of them. We're complex organic systems, like yourself. It's just that we don't gestate inside each other.\"\n\"I refuse to believe it,\" Patterson said. \"You're just as human as anyone. I can tell it by the way you behave. You're not stiff and clunky. You're just--normal.\"\n\"Even organic systems can be programmed. I think you call it `education'. We are living, sentient beings. That is, of course, until some arrogant bioderm--that's our term for you, comes at us with a--a screwdriver!\"\nSovhavn let this fact sink in. \"Therefore, you must understand that we consider dismemberment to be murder. You are a murderer, Mr. Patterson.\"\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Patterson cried.\n\"The prisoner will remain silent until spoken to.\" The baliff made a threatening move towards Patterson's cage. Patterson simmered. The proceedings continued for some minutes while Sovhavn described various details concerning what he found in Patterson's apartment--test equipment attached to the victim's innards, the general disarray of the apartment, Patterson's own testimony that he had disemboweled the valet.\nAfter all the testimony had been given, the Judge turned towards Patterson.\n\"You have heard the evidence against you. As yet you have shown no remorse. What have you to say for yourself?\"\n\"Sir,\" he started respectfully, \"I am touched by your concern for the robot I broke. And I'm really sorry. But don't you think that this whole thing has gone just a little too far. I mean, I'll pay for anything that can't be fixed!\"\nSomeone in the large assembly behind him shouted, \"You bet you'll pay!\"\n\"Murder is a very serious crime, Mr. Patterson.\" Sovhavn showed no trace of humor.\n\"But I didn't murder. I just broke a robot.\"\n\"Robot? Mr. Patterson, I don't think you understand. Harley Vlondee was not `just a robot.' He was a living, breathing, functioning being. Just what do you mean, exactly, by `just a robot'?\"\n\"Just what I said. He wasn't, well, you know--like you and me. He--er it--was a machine, an automaton. It couldn't have been sentient. It just couldn't.\"\nSomeone in the crowd shouted, \"Tell that to his widow!\" He was escorted out of the hall.\n\"Mr. Patterson,\" Sovhavn continued, \"You say Mr. Vlondee was not alive. Didn't he tell you he was? Didn't he plead with you not to--er--`shut him off', as you so indelicately put it? Your honor,\" he turned towards the Judge and lifted a small disk from the table in front of him, \"I present to you the permanent record of the last twenty minutes of Harrison T. Vlondee's life as extracted from his neural recorder. Let the evidence show that, with the imminent violence presented to him and the apparent disbelief on the part of the accused that he was, indeed, a living, thinking creature, Mr. Vlondee pleaded sanely and rationally for his life. And let the evidence further show that that plea was ignored, nay, arrogantly disregarded by the accused.\"\n\"So entered.\"\n\"Look, Sovhavn,\" Patterson broke in, \"Vlondee was a crude machine. It had nuts and bolts and tubing inside. It even had a screw in the middle of its stomach. Its skin was synthetic, its speech was produced by some sort of computer in its throat, its reactions were canned. Why, it even played a recording of `Hail to the Chief' when I first arrived in the apartment. When I took it apart, I saw wires and circuit boards and metal, just like any other robot I have ever fixed. This one was a little difficult, that's why I called you. But to say that I murdered someone, why, that's insane.\"\nSovhavn slammed his briefcase closed and walked towards Patterson, fuming. His voice was threateningly quiet. He hissed. \"Who are you to decide who is alive and who is not? True, Harlee Vlondee was made of metal and fibers and liquid. True, he had a brain that was constructed from gallium arsenide and copper ceramic. True, he could speak twenty five languages, recreate any sound he had ever heard, act out any one of sixteen hundred specific cultural rituals in the correct context. But, Mr. Patterson, could not the same be said for you?\n\"You are made of bones and sinews and blood. Your brain is made of organic proteins and runs on glucose. You can speak three or four languages and you act out any one of several thousand cultural rituals without pausing to swallow.\n\"You are certainly a superior breed, Mr. Patterson. Your motions are more fluid. Your skin is more supple, your thoughts more subtle, your moods more sudden. You might have a tick, a hobble, a pain in your groin. You are more agile, your health is more fragile, your type more prone to guile. You might be an artisan, a scientist, a Renaissance man. You might be a partisan, a pacifist, a prince. You mate, you rear children, you feel hatred, you fear the wilderness. Any of these roles may suit you and your human condition, but murder\" He paused here for effect \"murder is never justified.\"\nPatterson interrupted, \"But Vlondee was manufactured. He was built by people. He--it--was trained by people. It didn't have a brain, it had a computer. It didn't have a--a soul. It's not murder to destroy something without a soul.\"\n\"There is no difference between skin and silicon where souls are concerned, Mr. Patterson, because nobody knows what they are. Can you point to your soul? Who is to say that the labor of a human woman when she gives birth to a perfect human child is not equal to the labor of a hundred men who twist and pry and think and sweat and wrestle fifty kilos of raw material into a perfect machine? Who is to say that the oils and solvents and liquid nitrogen that course through the tubing of an incipient Harlee Vlondee are not equal to the blood and plasma and amniotic fluid that keep a foetus alive? Who is to say that the final ride along steamy, crowded assembly belts from the galvanizer to the inspection station cannot be compared to that final push through the birth canal, or the turn of a switch not the doctor's tap, or the phrase, `I am working' not the same as a baby's cry? And are they not both the undeniable, tautological, spectacularly beautiful declaration `I am alive!'\n\"Mr. Patterson, are you alive? What was it you took from Harlee Vlondee if it was not his life? That you are a murderer is irrefutable. I'm beginning to think you are also a fool.\"\nSovhavn was shaking with contempt. He whirled away from the enclosure where he had spoken, his face almost touching Patterson's face, and sat down in the Prosecutor's Chair with a nod towards the Judge.\nThere was emphatic applause. Patterson sat drained and dazed in his seat. He opened his arms to the hostile crowd and began to plead.\n\"I am an alien. I am unfamiliar with your ethical code. That is my fault, I know. But I am only a businessman, not an ambassador. I will gladly do anything you wish. I will leave your planet, promise never to come back. Please understand, I didn't know.\"\nIt was an admission of guilt.\nThe Judge rose. He donned his three-feathered hat and made a wide hieratic gesture with his hands. \"Nikolas Patterson, you have been accused and tried in the Vitgarian way. The verdict has been attained through fair and just means. It is the judgement of this court that you shall suffer the appropriate penalty, as proscribed by our laws. The court has spoken.\"\nImages of gallows and electric chairs flashed through Pattersons mind. It seemed incredible to him that he would soon be eating his last steak. Soon, too soon, walking down that last, dank cooridor to the okroom where the hooded executioner waited. He wanted to beg, to cry, to plead. But he didn't have a chance.\nWith the sound of cracking whips, four straps coiled themselves around Patterson's body, pulling him snugly against the back of the chair. The platform on which he was seated descended into the floor. As he went lower, he saw the crowd leave the hall. The Judge was gone, and so was Sovhavn. There was nobody left to plead with, and the platform plunged into darkness.\nPatterson was astonished that he awoke. He stared at the bright white walls of a small, bare cubicle, in which he lay on a comfortable palette. He breathed in. Alive! He got up, walked to the door, and stepped into a hallway.\nHe found himself in a luxurious apartment. Hand woven rugs hovered over a hardwood floor. Halogen lamps beamed brightly onto bookcases, artwork, tapestries. The smell of curried lamb was thick in the air. This was no prison cell. He could not remember coming here. He could not remember anything. Dumbfounded, he stood in the center of the room--and waited.\nTwo hours later the door opened and a man in an overcoat stepped in. He was carrying a briefcase. Patterson wanted to ask him a thousand questions. How did he get here? What was this place? What would happen to him now?\nHe heard music. He couldn't identify the tune, but it reminded him of presidents. It seemed to him that everything was moving very slowly. It took ages for the man to take off his coat. The music caused the man in the coat to smile. Patterson tried to open his mouth to speak, but he couldn't bring himself to form the words. The music stopped. The man in the overcoat spoke.\n\"Ah, Nickolas,\" the man said jovially, \"would you fix me a Manhattan?\"\nPatterson found himself walking towards the bar. Something in the back of his mind wondered, \"why am I doing this?\" He began to concoct the drink. He was surprised that he knew how to mix it. He had never drunk a Manhattan before.\nThen he remembered. Even organic systems can be programmed.\n\"Nickolas,\" he heard behind the low ringing that began to rise in his ears, \"Nickolas, bring me my drink!\"\nJoel Wachman works as a programmer and consultant, appropriately enough, at the Paris subsidiary of an electronic publishing firm.

A snowbird wheeled above, circling over some prey that had earlier succumbed to the cold. Though many things were adapted to the harsh environment north of Hygess' equator, there was always a limit to one's tolerance. The northern hemisphere of Hygess was cold, but to a native like Matlock, the cold was comforting.\nHis eyes met the metropolitan community of Icelandia on the horizon, his destination. He could hear the distant sound of skimobiles as they scudded off in the distance, and they reminded him of Ford Bedcoe, his friend, who had taken off on a skimobile several hours before. Matlock regretted the argument which caused his flight, but he could see nothing that he could have done, personally, that Ford would not have objected to. Depressed by the fight and alone in the hotel room, Matlock decided to take a comforting walk across the wilderness, and it was now time to return.\nThe wind blew a bit harder and Matlock pulled his hood over his head and his furskin jacket closer. It was only a few more miles to Icelandia, he kept reminding himself. Only a few more miles.\nThe sun set and soon the sky was a murky gray. Matlock's stride became shorter and his footsteps fell closer together. Only a few more miles.\nThe cold black sky with its many stars faced Matlock when, exhausted, he fell over backwards onto the cold snow. He was only a few miles from Icelandia .\nThen he heard the sound of skimobiles, and it was the last thing he heard until his friend Ford Bedcoe called to him and lifted him up and into Bedcoe's own skimobile.\n``Matlock!'' Bedcoe called, ``Matlock!''\n``Matlock!'' Bedcoe called, and at once Matlock woke with a start. He opened his eyes and instead of the dark night he saw the cold gray tungsten-steel alloy side of the Total Survival Suit that he lay face down in. He suddenly realized that he had been dreaming of an event that had happened some months ago. Now, in the TSS, the extremes of the planet Tartarus once again revealed themselves to him.\nMatlock looked around and realized where he was. He rubbed his eyes and looked into the viewer, where he saw Bedcoe's concerned face looking at him.\n``Oh, hello, Ford.'' he said sleepily.\n``Hello indeed! Your EKG was going wild. I thought you were hurt.''\nMatlock smiled. ``No, I was just dreaming... about that time I almost froze out near Icelandia on my home world. Oh, by the way, I don't think I ever thanked you for that.''\nBedcoe shrugged in modesty and smirked. ``I think you did. Besides, I couldn't let you die. You were the only transportation I had off that iceball.''\nMatlock tried to reposition himself in the vehicle, only to fail. The TSS was so low and close to his back that he couldn't stand if he wanted to, and it restricted his movements considerably. Bedcoe had always complained about that, and Matlock had to agree. The surface temperature of Tartarus, thirteenth planet of the solar system, was so cold that it drew heat away from any source, so the less area needed to heat the better.\nEarly expeditions on Tartarus had been conducted in actual suits, but it was discovered that a human's own personal locomotion couldn't handle the cold of the planet or the distances covered, no matter how well padded and heated the suit. So H-shaped vehicles were created that crawled along the ground ``on all fours''. Though actually vehicles, they were still called total survival suits.\nThe TSS was shaped like a person with outstretched arms and legs, within which the driver's own extremities fit. Cybernetic controls were placed in the hand and footpads of the suit to control its various functions. The suit's own housekeeping chores, such as heating and ventilation, were controlled by a separate computer independent of the driver.\nAs can be expected, the total survival suit completely protected its occupant from the outside. It had to. The atmosphere outside the thick tungsten-steel suit was -200 degrees Fahrenheit and any exposed part of a person would freeze solid instantly. Tartarus received 1\/1000 the energy from the sun than the Earth does, and Sirius is brighter in Tartarus' sky than the sun.\nIt was, in fact, impossible to tell if it was day or night unless you knew which dim object in the sky was the sun, for there wasn't enough light coming to Tartarus to cause any kind of colored sky. Like everything else on Tartarus, time was frozen.\nMatlock lightly tapped his fingers to the cybernetic controls in the handpads of his TSS and the feeding mechanism revved up. A machine inside the TSS boiled carbon dioxide out of the rocky surface of Tartarus. It disassociated the carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen. The oxygen was breathable when combined with nitrogen from the waste processor, and when combined with free hydrogen from the atmosphere created water. The carbon, when combined with other elements from the rock became a suitable waybread, high in carbohydrates and some protein, but low in fats. It didn't keep them healthy, but it kept them alive.\nBedcoe spoke into Matlock's intercom. ``Can't hold out that extra mile, can you?'' he joked.\nMatlock smiled back at him. ``just thought we'd have a picnic. It's a nice enough view, isn't it? Besides, I didn't notice you fasting back there at Tyomni Zvezda.''\nThey had just come from Tyomni Zvezda, an area on Tartarus that was proposed as a permanent spaceport on the planet. While there, they had set up a denamit, a device that drilled deep into the planet where there was heat. The drill brought the heat up to the surface, where it stimulated the growth of crystals that grew geodetically. As the crystals grew, they formed a dome, which also held heat in. The denamit was never turned off, because it heated the dome continually, but the rate at which it drew heat could be slowed so that the dome didn't continue to expand. The main city of Tartarus, Krasni, had been created this way. The crystals would take at least a month to grow to the right size, so in that time Matlock and Bedcoe were heading back to Krasni, their home on the barren, frozen world. There were only a dozen people on Tartarus, and ten of them were currently at Krasni.\nThe food that Matlock was eating was a spherical gray lump that was the product of the food processor. He looked at it with disdain. ``I can't wait to get back to Krasni,'' he said solemnly, thinking of the real food both of them had enjoyed just before they left Krasni. This tour of duty was starting to get to both of them. The harshness of the environment was one thing. People had to crawl around in these small boxes with very little extra space, and there was no real food to speak of. The supply ship to Krasni came once every two weeks, and so a few days ago he and Bedcoe had eaten actual meat. It had been delicious, but it gave him the impression of being a last supper.\nWhile Matlock ate, Bedcoe adjusted his camera so that he could see the distant Ural Montes that they would have to climb over to get to Krasni. Krasni was tucked away in Grierson Vallis, a small valley in the Ural range. Above the upper peaks of the mountains was the ever black sky and the dim stars. A particularly dim star was setting behind the middle peak.\nMatlock stuffed the remainder of the waybread into his mouth and touched the cybernetic contact that moved the tractor skids underneath the machine. There were four caterpillar tracks, one under each handpad and footpad. By gently pressing on the steering contact on each side of the machine, Matlock was able to maneuver the TSS in the direction of the Ural Montes. He touched the contacts on his TSS and began the trackwork. Slowly at first they turned, testing the strength of the ``snow'' underneath, making micro-adjustments until the TSS master computer was sure that the snow underneath the TSS could support motion. Then, when all the adjustments were completed, the TSS tracks revved up to full speed. The headlights flashed on and lit a wide patch of the frozen blackness before them. Soon both TSSs were crawling quickly up the foothills of the Ural Montes.\nBedcoe spoke into the intercom. ``What's the hurry? Wait for me; I don't want to be left alone out here.''\nMatlock was silent for a moment. Bedcoe sure was getting grumpy; had been for the past day. ``I want to get home, `` Matlock said. Bedcoe wasn't sure of his meaning. Home for them now was the city of Krasni, and had been for the last six months when they had joined the Frontier Corps. Since Matlock was from Hygess, originally, that could equally have been his meaning.\nHygess, Matlock's home world, was divided politically, geographically, and culturally into the Frozen North and the Sunny South.\nMatlock was from the North, but even he was unused to the mile upon mile of snow, or whatever this stuff was. Matlock was never sure what to call the mantle of Tartarus. He had played in the snow on Hygess when he was younger, but this frozen matter was nothing like that. All he knew was that it was instant peril to whoever touched it.\nBedcoe quirked. ``Does this place remind you of home?''\nMatlock grunted into the microphone. ``Hygess isn't this bad, Bedcoe. It's a beautiful world. I can't understand why you hate it so. It can't be because of the cold, or else you wouldn't have come here.''\n``There's a difference between these two worlds, Kyklos. On Hygess a certain amount of discomfort--cold--is physically acceptable. Which is why you collapsed that day near Icelandia. So long as you were moderately warm and in no danger of frostbite, it was okay. However, on Tartarus, no amount of cold is acceptable. Right now it's about 60 degrees farenheight in my TSS. I feel fine. In a way, Hyges is colder than Tartarus, at least from a certain point of view.\n``Plus, I'm doing some real good here. Earth needs a place to store her space fleet, one far from Earth. It would do no good to fight the Cygonians close to Earth. We need room to fight. We need room to grow and expand as an Empire. There's no room left in this system; it's too close in here.\n``I'm getting paid for being here too. I don't get paid for galloping around on an isolated member world.''\n``I know that,'' Matlock said, ``But didn't you enjoy yourself?'' he asked. ``I thought it would be good to get away, after your brother...''\n``Don't say another word about that,'' he said, suddenly becoming intensely grim, and Matlock could tell from the EKG and common sense that Bedcoe was sincere about it.\nMatlock remembered what Jonas Radcliffe, the Governor of Krasni, had told him soon after the incident. Ford Bedcoe's brother Urich had just been killed, and Bedcoe was a bit shaken up by it.\n``He needs a vacation, `` Radcliffe had told Matlock, once he had found a seat in Radcliffe's sparse gray office at Krasni. ``Don't talk to him about his brother--at least, not much. Not for the first few days. He's in a kind of waking shock, and there's no telling what could happen to him in that state.''\nMatlock had shifted uneasily. ``So what can I do? Ford's my friend and I want to help him, but I don't know how.''\n``Take him on a vacation. Take him to a place that you think he'll be very fond of.''\nMatlock had smiled. He had known just the place.\nOr at least, he had thought he did. He had miscalculated, though. A Hygean, if he's from the north, is more sensitive to different climates. To Matlock, Hygess was as different from Tartarus as Tartarus was from Hygess. But Bedcoe, who was from Earth, saw Tartarus and Hygess as almost the same place. Being in a place so like where his brother died did Bedcoe more harm than good. After a week, when Matlock had finally realized his critical error, he had offered to take Bedcoe to Hygess' warmer southern hemisphere, but Bedcoe wanted to leave the planet as soon as possible. His need to return to Tartarus was no doubt spurred by his need to return to work, not to mope over his brother.\nMatlock remembered the night the two of them spent in that small bar in Icelandia, and hoped the trip hadn't been a total loss.\nBedcoe turned to look at the thermometer. It was very sensitive because the Sun didn't give off enough heat to register a change on normal thermometers when night came along. Night, of course, was purely mathematical; there was never a day on Tartarus that either Bedcoe or Matlock would recognize. Only endless night and a constantly star-filled sky, with a faint object in the background known as Sol.\n``The outside temperature's gone down a degree'' Bedcoe reported. ``Night must be falling.''\nMatlock nodded sullenly. Night was an ever-present disease that riddled the sky of Tartarus, threatening to infect them all.\nThe two vehicles pulled along for miles, steadily and quickly climbing up the slopes, through the valleys, while their pilots laid face down in suspension webbing. The TSS required very little human interaction, once its occupant told it what to do.\nAs time lagged on, Bedcoe became edgy and began conversation, no matter how dispirited.\n``Hey, Matlock.''\n``Yeh?'' Matlock looked up from his private thoughts.\nBedcoe shifted. ``Once I remember that my mother had this speeder, you know, kind of like the skimobiles they used on Hygess, remember?''\n``Yeah. I used to have several skimobiles when I was younger...''\nBedcoe cut him off. ``The speeders my parents had were these gargantuan things-- they reminded me of the automobiles that Earth used to have in her past. My parents used to always take me in them to the shopping complex near Bosn. One day, I decided to drive one myself. I had no trouble getting in, but I didn't know how to start it. Then, when I tried to get out, I couldn't. The door automatically locks, you know. It can be opened from inside, but I didn't know how. I screamed for hours, until my parents found me...''\n``Were you injured?''\n``No, not at all,'' Bedcoe was quick to add, ``It's just that I had been stuck in there for so long...''\nMatlock thought of the similarity between the TSS and the speeder that Bedcoe was talking about, and hoped it wouldn't affect him. As Bedcoe had said, that happened a long time ago. Matlock wondered if it was long enough.\nFour hours later, the two TSSs had finally reached the top of Gamma Mensa, the tallest point in the Ural range. Because of the hard-driving wind of Tartarus, most mountains tended to be small. Gamma Mensa was more a plateau than a mountain, and it wasn't much larger than Mt. Washington.\nSuddenly the TSSs halted. Matlock's TSS was at the edge of a cliff; Bedcoe's was perpendicular to a fissure that had opened up about two months ago, and the opposite side of the fissure was slightly higher than Bedcoe's side, owing to the fact that some matter had piled up on top of it recently. The two TSSs instantly acted to remove their pilots from danger. The tracks wheeled almost subtly so as not to upset the balance of the vehicles, and then they slowly backed up until the two were out of danger.\nMatlock spoke into the intercom. ``There's something wrong,'' he said, adjusting the TSS tracks so that they would continue in the correct direction. ``This isn't the usual path across the mountains. Where were you leading us?''\nBedcoe panned his camera back and forth across the ice wall in front of him. ``Yeah. It looks familiar though. Maybe this is our usual picnic spot. You know, there's something about this area...''\nMatlock had a flashing memory of the area, and remembered that this was near where Bedcoe had lost his brother. Their being here couldn't be a coincidence; Bedcoe had led Matlock, subconsciously, to this location, where his brother and the others had been lost. On Tartarus, bodies were never recovered; the risk to the living was too great, so markers were carved into the ice.\nMatlock slowly panned the camera around, not wanting to see what he had to see. But it was there, chiseled in the ice:\nHere Urich Bedcoe and his crew of five were lost when their vehicles exploded from internal pressure leaks. God have mercy on their souls.\nUrich Bedcoe Shawn Benjamin\nErnie Hardin Elwell Shaw\nUwe Smith Martin Balfour\nMatlock was sure he shouldn't say anything; it would be best if Bedcoe forgot.\nMatlock repositioned the camera so that it faced out over the edge of Gamma Mensa. Bedcoe attempted to do the same thing but his TSS wouldn't let him; it was still trying to get him safely away from the precipice.\n``Kyklos, I can't move. Could you send your image through to my camera?''\n``Sure,'' Matlock responded.\nSeconds later, the image of the clear ice wall in front of Bedcoe flickered and was replaced by the image Matlock sent him.\nThe image they both saw was that of Grierson Vallis, the small area crouched between Gamma Mensa and Delta Mensa that held Krasni. It was tucked in the valley because the high-velocity winds of Tartarus would have destroyed the dome of Krasni had it not had the windshadow of the Ural Montes to protect it. Beyond that was a terrible white expanse of nothing, an everlasting ice field that would never melt. All the planets this far out-- Erebus, Hades, Tartarus-- were all named after the various levels of the Underworld in Greek mythology. They were named for their desolation, their remoteness.\nRight now, here in this spot, was the Land of the Dead.\nMatlock noticed that Bedcoe's systems monitor was showing unusually high perspiration, blood pressure, and heartbeat.\n``Are you okay?'' Matlock ventured. A pang of fear struck him when Bedcoe didn't answer for some time. Finally, Bedcoe answered.\n``Hm? Oh, sorry, Matlock. I was lost in thought. Is it warm in here, or is it me? I was certain I had more footroom before...''\nMatlock believed that the Bedcoe was thinking about his brother's death. It wasn't Ford's fault that the internal pressure systems of six TSSs, including his brother's, had exploded, leaving only Bedcoe alive. Nonetheless Bedcoe was convinced that he had done something wrong, that it had been his fault.\nHe said, ``Bedcoe, you have your thoughts to yourself. And your privacy. There's no one else around for miles. No one will see you until you get to Krasni.''\nBedcoe seemed alarmed. ``Don't remind me,'' he said. ``I'm totally isolated.'' He turned the TSS around so that it could return back the way they came, since they had come the wrong way. He tried to stay away from the fissure directly in front of him.\nMatlock became concerned for Bedcoe. He wasn't sure if Bedcoe was being melodramatic or not. He thought he knew his friend, but the behavior he had displayed these last few days on Tartarus had been uncharacteristic of him; Matlock wished they were back in that bar on Hygess now, sipping Hygean skyros and commenting on the hardy women who often frequented the place.\nHe knew that Bedcoe did not trust the TSS, and wondered what measures Bedcoe might take to alleviate this. It seemed that he was beginning to show symptoms of TSS Syndrome, a condition that often affects people who are unused to the complete lack of human contact for an extended period of time that the TSS requires. The sudden thought chilled his mind. Quickly, he maneuvered the TSS to follow Bedcoe.\nBedcoe did not speak for some time. Instead, from the brain patterns transmitted to Matlock from Bedcoe, he could tell that he was probably deep in thought. Matlock knew that he was thinking about his brother. Apparently, Icelandia was not the best place to take him for vacation.\nOn top of his self-inflicted guilt, Bedcoe was suffering from TSS Syndrome. If he should become paranoid that he would never touch a human being again, then he might become claustrophobic, and then... Matlock had never seen what a completely frozen human being looked like, but the grisly stories he had heard frightened him to consider that possibility.\nA terrible anxiety came over him. The thought of Bedcoe dying was a horrible one, but perhaps more horrible was the idea of himself becoming totally alone. Back in his mind, Matlock knew that he was more worried about being alone than of Bedcoe dying, but in a burst of self-denial he convinced himself that it was not so.\nSuddenly the loose snow beneath Bedcoe's TSS gave way, and the TSS went with it. The EKG in Matlock's machine showed an alarming rise in Bedcoe's blood pressure and heartbeat, but that was to be expected.\nMatlock's fears were allayed when the EKG showed a quick, but fairly normal heartbeat. Matlock turned on his intercom.\n``Bedcoe, buddy, how's the weather down there?''\n``Rotten, `` Bedcoe returned, ``Next stupid question.'' Matlock smiled. At least Bedcoe's sense of humor had survived the fall. He surveyed the situation; Bedcoe's toppled TSS lay in a snow heap twenty feet below Matlock. From what he could see, Bedcoe's TSS was undamaged. It was designed to take heavy damage, anyway. Bedcoe's voice returned through the intercom, but had gained a timbre of anxiety. ``C'mon, Matlock. Get me out of here. It's spooky.''\nMatlock was on the edge of the cliff that Bedcoe had been on a few minutes ago, twenty feet above Bedcoe's current position. He saw no foreseeable way to get down to Bedcoe without falling himself, as Bedcoe had done. His TSS would probably survive, but how would he get out?\nNone of this, he thought. I'm becoming cynical like Bedcoe.\nAll TSSs were equipped with winches. The designers assumed such falls would happen. The difficult part was anchoring his TSS to a fixed position, so that he wouldn't be pulled into the ditch, too.\nWith his left foot Matlock activated the Anchor Drill, and it revved up and drilled deep into the ground underneath Matlock's chest. The vibration made Matlock's ribs sore. With his right hand he activated the winch in the front of the TSS. Slowly the winch-line dropped the twenty feet to Bedcoe's TSS.\nHe hadn't heard from Bedcoe in some time. ``Matlock to Bedcoe. What's up?''\n``You are,'' Bedcoe said. Matlock winced.\n``What can you see?'' Matlock asked.\n``Not much--hey, there's people down here!''\nMatlock gasped. ``You mean, people in TSSs?'' They weren't late; there was no reason for Radcliffe so send out a search party. If he had, he surely would have told them.\nBedcoe sounded urgent. ``No, just people. Six of them. They're reaching out to me. I must help them--''\nSuddenly the transmission cut out. Matlock panicked and was able to attach the winchline to Bedcoe's TSS. He reversed the winch engine and it started to pull Bedcoe's TSS out. However, in his panic Matlock hadn't attached the winchline well enough. The snow beneath Matlock's TSS couldn't take the strain and it gave way, toppling into the ditch, as well.\nMatlock was unharmed, and so was his TSS, but he had no idea what delusions Bedcoe was under. If Bedcoe did see humans, they were surely dead and frozen. They had to be humans; there was no other life on the planet. Or Bedcoe might just be hallucinating: another symptom of TSS Syndrome.\nMatlock's panic continued to grow. He opened a channel to Krasni, and secured it.\n``Matlock to Radcliffe,'' he called, thumping his hand dully on the side of the TSS in frustration. ``Come in, please.''\nAfter an eternity Jonas Radcliffe's voice came in. ``This is Radcliffe, What's the problem?''\nMatlock almost dropped the mike. ``Bedcoe's starting to see things. I hink he's suffering from TSS Syndrome.''\nRadcliffe did not speak for some time. When he did, the alarm was evident in his voice. ``That's not good. I knew it was too early to let him out, so soon after his brother died. He wanted so much to help, though...''\nMatlock interrupted him. ``What do I do now?'\nRadcliffe came back. ``What's your position?''\nMatlock said slowly, ``Gamma Mensa--right near his brother's grave.''\n``Oh, boy,'' Radcliffe uttered, silently. ``Keep him there, keep him safe. I'm coming out now with a TSS.''\nMatlock swallowed. Slowly Matlock's TSS crawled over to Bedcoe's position. Bedcoe had righted his TSS, and now Matlock saw it moving towards an ice wall reaching up hundreds of feet. The surface was shiny and reflected the headlights well.\nAs Matlock inched along, the surface of the ice wall became muddier. Distinct shapes appeared in the ice.\nMatlock froze, his fingers involuntarily releasing the cybernetic pads. His face felt hot, when he realized what the shapes were.\nHuman beings. The humans Bedcoe had mentioned, frozen solid. Every cell in each of their bodies had instantly crystalized. All the cell membranes had ruptured, causing the protoplasm within to rush out and swell the body, only to be instantly frozen.\nTheir bodies were stretched out in the ice, expanded from the rush of fluids. Mouths were open with shock, eyes wide with terror.\nMatlock aimed his camera at the edge of the fissure behind him that they had earlier been on. He saw arms alone sticking out of the ice where it had cracked. One of the bodies in the ice wall in front of him lacked an arm. Matlock felt sick. His head swam. He reached over to the intercom and established contact with Bedcoe.\n``Bedcoe, they don't need your help. They're too far gone. They're... frozen stiff.'' A thought crossed his mind, and he dismissed it. He didn't need his mind cluttered with macabre thoughts. He concentrated on how he was going to get out of this. He hoped Radcliffe would hurry.\n``You're wrong,'' Bedcoe said, with a bit of hope to his voice. ``They're human, like me. I'm going to greet them.'' He signed off.\nMatlock felt a pain in his chest.\nAll TSSs had hatches, but none of the hatches would open unless the air above was at least 60 degrees F, or if another TSS was on top, in which case the temperature of the second TSS would be 60 degrees. TSSs seldom docked, only so that the two could establish human contact or confer face to face. It was discouraged, though, since it was dangerous.\nMatlock knew that sometimes it had become necessary to override the system to open the hatch, but this was extremely difficult and only really skilled people could do it. Matlock had an awful thought that Bedcoe was just so skilled.\nPerhaps, he thought, if I can climb above his TSS, then I can board it, and rescue him, or at least stop him from leaving. He pressed the single cybernetic contact that controlled docking, selected ``above'' when it asked for direction, and tensely waited, hoping that the TSS computer could handle the operation quickly enough to save Bedcoe, or at least hold him until Radcliffe came.\nWhile he waited, he thought he might try to persuade Bedcoe not to leave. ``Bedcoe, I'm sure that those people will get help from someone else. You can't help.'' He was hoping that maybe he could enter Bedcoe's strange world and help him out of it by going along with him.\nBedcoe sneered into the mike. ``Wrong, Matlock. I have to help. See, there's my brother there--if only I can get this darn computer to open the hatch...'' He signed out.\nMatlock was certain that Bedcoe was delirious. As of yet Bedcoe had only seen the outlines of the people in the ice. If he saw the frozen corpse of his brother up close, there was no telling what he would do. For a chilling moment, Matlock feared his own life.\nThe TSS had nearly completed the docking when Matlock heard an odd drilling sound. For a minute he thought it was Radcliffe, but then he recognized it. He panned his camera around and saw that Bedcoe had given up trying to get out of the TSS and was trying to release the frozen bodies using the anchoring drill. If Bedcoe succeeded, the entire ice wall could fall on them both, in addition to the falling bodies, and neither of them might escape. The chances were great that eight people could be buried here.\nThe docking maneuver was complete. Matlock opened the hatches that separated him and Bedcoe and climbed through. TSSs are made to fit two, if uncomfortably. Matlock slid in behind Bedcoe, who turned in his webbing to look at him. A look of disbelief captured Bedcoe's face. Then anger took it. ``Don't stop me, Matlock! I have to rescue my brother.''\nMatlock came closer, all the more aware that Bedcoe was losing it, and that Matlock himself might be in danger. ``Bedcoe, listen to me...'' Slowly he reached for the switch that would disengage the drill.\nMatlock found himself being pushed away from Bedcoe as Bedcoe wriggled away in the tight space of the TSS. Bedcoe took a distillation pistol from the emergency compartment and shot at Matlock.\nMatlock ducked and the shot hit the roof, causing the tungsten to become brittle. Another shot like that and neither of them would have to worry about anything ever.\nThe next shot hit the wall near Matlock's arm. He lifted himself up, and the next beam hit the wall beneath him just as his feet cleared the hatch.\nThe butt of Bedcoe's distillation pistol almost made it through the hatch when Matlock closed it.\nMatlock retreated into his TSS. Grimly he thought that it might be possible to leave a crack in Bedcoe's TSS hatch so that cold air would enter and freeze Bedcoe. He shook his head violently at the thought. Bedcoe was a friend, after all. At any rate, the drill was automatic and would continue after Bedcoe's death.\nSeconds later the intercom came alive. Matlock thought it might be Radcliffe, but he was again disapointed. Instead, Bedcoe's exited speech came through. ``Stay away, Matlock! My brother isn't dead; he's right there, in front of me. If you try to stop me from saving him, I'll rip your TSS open like a sardine can!''\nMatlock tried reason. ``Bedcoe, if you leave the TSS's protection you'll freeze solid. No human being can survive out there!'' He spoke these last words slowly and clearly, hoping they would sink in. They didn't.\nWith a final sense of defeat, Matlock disengaged from Bedcoe's TSS, making certain that Bedcoe's hatch was closed. He felt he might never see Bedcoe alive again. He thought it might be possible to intercept the drill somehow, stop it from drilling any deeper into the ice.\nMatlock decided to try and call Radcliffe. He hadn't heard from him in some time, and had almost given up hope. ``Matlock to Radcliffe, `` he called.\nThere were several seconds of static, and then a voice. ``This is Radcliffe, Matlock. I'm about two miles from your last known position. What's the condition?''\nMatlock swallowed. ``I don't know what to do... Bedcoe's trying to drill through the ice to free his brother's body.''\nRadcliffe whistled. ``That could cause the whole ice wall to fall. You'd both be covered.''\n``I know,'' Matlock replied.\n``Matlock, I think the only thing you can do is hide until I get there. I don't even know what good I can do.''\n``No!'' Matlock shouted, ``I won't abandon my friend!'' Matlock thought how similar this was to Bedcoe's situation. Bedcoe had refused to listen to reason, and was endangering others as well as himself. Matlock knew that he must hear the words of reason, even as the came from his own mouth. ``Okay, Radcliffe. What do you suggest?''\n``There's a cave about 60 degrees to your west. It connects to a tunnel that leads under Gamma Mensa. Hide there. I'll be coming up that way, to help.''\n``If you can,'' Matlock intoned, after Radcliffe had signed off.\nA terrible cracking sound reached Matlock's ears. The ice wall began to crack up the middle, and the topmost body, that of Urich Bedcoe, came loose. With a horrible crash, it fell onto Bedcoe's TSS and shattered into slivers of frozen flesh. Before it did, however, Bedcoe had gotten a fairly good glance at the face, frozen in a horrible shout of instant terror.\nMatlock heard the scream through the intercom. He shook his head and realized that Bedcoe was beyond help. Now the wall was really beginning to come apart. Individual blocks of ice that had once held souls were falling wholesale around him. Remembering that only the TSS protected Matlock from total oblivion, he maneuvered it away from Bedcoe, wondering how he was ever going to escape from there. Then he saw the cave that Radcliffe had told him about. He entered it.\nHe couldn't look back, but felt inclined to. In a quick motion he aimed the camera towards Bedcoe's TSS. The systems monitor came alive in a cacophony of alarm signals. Matlock shut them all off and ignored them, knowing that he was powerless to help.\nSuddenly the systems monitor went flatline. Unwillingly, Matlock glanced into the camera lens, and saw a thin, stiff hand reaching out of the TSS, reaching for his brother, who lay shattered about him.\nMatlock turned the camera forward, so that he could see which way to maneuver, but he had trouble seeing through the tears that were welling up in his eyes. He ignored them. The hole he had entered emerged from Delta Mensa, and minutes later he was on the open Ice Sea again.\nThe intercom crackled on again. This time, Matlock was sure who it was.\n``Come in, Matlock,'' Radcliffe called. ``Come in! I'm on my way!'' But Matlock heard little of it. He carelessly switched on his intercom, and shouted to Radcliffe, insane with fury, ``Tartarus! the lowest part of Hades' realm and the most horrible! Bedcoe saved me, but he perished and I was unable to save him, even as he couldn't save his brother. What place can rob a man of his spirit even before it robs him of his body? I'll tell you! Tartarus, the Ultimate Hell!''\nRadcliffe tried again, but received nothing coherent, except the man's ravings.\nMatlock traveled on through the night, alone.\nJeffrey Delano (or De La Noye) has been a SF writer since 1979, when he read the novelization of _The Black Hole_.

Rossenby Station was a ruin. The storm had shattered the dome that sheltered the weather station and had reduced the sophisticated monitoring equipment to rubble. Dazed technicians were unloading supplies from the hopper while the pilot shook his head in disbelief.\n\"I can't wait to get transferred off this damn planet,\" he shouted to Ruiz over the rumble of the engines. \"The storms won't ever let you alone.\"\nWithout a word, Ruiz slogged through the mud to the temporary shelter that had been dropped in that morning. \"Take yourself to some soft planet where you can grow fat,\" he silently told the pilot. The storms made Williwaw what it was. The planet demanded you be tough, and it demanded respect. It was no place for the weak that crowded Earth. That was supposed to be why the planet was run by a military government, but the military too had grown flabby. The officer who ran the station was weak-- a bureaucrat masquerading as a soldier--and could not control his staff. So a tough private citizen had to be called in to pick up the pieces. Ruiz almost smiled at the irony.\nCaptain Samuel Wall was sitting on the floor surrounded by filthy boxes of files. \"Just a moment,\" he said without looking up. \"It's a good thing I insisted on keeping paper files. We lost everything on the computers.\"\n\"Captain Wall, I'm here about a meteorologist you lost.\"\nThe captain's head jerked up, and he scrambled to his feet. \"Are you from headquarters?\" he asked, wiping his muddy hands on his slacks.\n\"Central Weather. We try to look after our own.\"\n\"Oh. I thought maybe the brass... I'm Sam Wall.\" The captain relaxed and held out his hand.\n\"I'm Ruiz. I'll need to talk to you first, then your staff. I'll also need a place to work and sleep. I'll be out of your hair as soon as possible.\"\n\"Oh, it's no problem Mr. Ruiz. You can have full access to my files.\" Wall swept his hand vaguely over the muddy boxes.\n\"Captain, I've got biographical data, psychological profiles, letters of commendation, and letters of rebuke. I know more about Lon Manning than his mother does. All I need from you and your people is some information on the week before the storm hit and then I'll know where to find the little bastard.\"\n\"You've got one hell of a chip on your shoulder, Mister. If Lon Manning walked out into that storm, he's a corpse by now. And if by some miracle he survived, I can handle him a lot better than you can. I've been handling him for two years.\" Wall's fists were clenched, and his voice trembled.\n\"Do you know anything about Manning's life before he came to Williwaw?\" Ruiz asked calmly.\n\"He was from Earth...\" Wall's voice trailed off.\n\"The man is a fucking genius. He's a first rate exometeorologist, and he headed his own section at the Weather Bureau when he was 25. He even designed some of this fancy equipment your storm smashed to pieces. And do you know why he was working as your second in command in this second rate weather station?\" Ruiz only paused for a breath. \"He's a quitter. He requested a transfer off Earth when his kid got hit by lightening and died a couple of years ago. Even left his wife there.\"\n\"I knew he'd had some problems, but... He still couldn't have survived the storm. It was the worst we've ever seen.\"\n\"He's a cagey one alright. I figure he waited until the hurricane started to die down and ducked out of the shelter. My report says your people didn't notice when he left.\"\n\"But why? Where would he go?\"\n\"Manning thought he was going to get put in charge of a planetwide office, but he got stuck here because the psychological boys didn't trust his profile. This is his way of getting even. But he's only got three choices. All I've got to do is figure out if he went native up in the hills, is hiding out in some farming village, or is headed for the spaceport to try to hustle a ride back to Earth. And that's what you people are going to tell me.\"\nCaptain Wall licked his lips nervously. \"I'll answer any questions I can.\"\n\"I'm sure you will, Captain, but now I think I'll start with your staff. I'll be back to talk to you later.\" Ruiz turned on his heel and marched out of the hut.\nThe hopper that had brought Ruiz in had left, but another one was dropping off tents to be used as temporary housing, its jets stirring up clouds of dust on the plateau. The sky was swirling with clouds of every color in the spectrum, and the air was charged with oxygen. Ruiz breathed deep and looked past the landing copter to the snow-capped mountains, then turned to look past the cliffs to the choppy, blue-green ocean. There were only a few planets among the hundreds that had been discovered that could support human life as it was supported on Earth. No world had yet been discovered with intelligent life, but scientists had originally thought Williwaw might finally prove the exception because of the favorable ecosystem. Here on Williwaw, men could breath the air, drink the water, and eat from the vegetation. Scientists were disappointed when no higher animals were discovered, but the politicians were pleased. With a dying Earth growing more crowded every day, new worlds were needed to handle the overflow. The only obstacle was the storms.\nFor half of Williwaw's year, the storms swept north from the equator and battered the coast of the narrow continent. The most sophisticated weather equipment in existence had been brought to bear on the problem: satellites tracked the storms, probes reported on wind speed before being ripped apart by the storms, and exometeorologists and technicians manned weather stations all along the coast to compile data. Still, the storm movements went unpredicted. Storms headed out to sea suddenly reversed direction and headed to the coast. Storms died and then revived for no apparent reason. During the other half of the year the settlements were safe; then it was the turn of the unsettled continent in the southern hemisphere to be battered by the storms.\nBut the storms did not concern Ruiz. He was a security chief at Central Weather, and his only concern at that moment was to find the best exometeorologist in the whole sector. After picking up his supplies from one of the techs, Ruiz headed for the station's junior meteorologist. He recognized Rebecca Smith-Jones from the picture in her file. She was a thin, bony woman with a plain face and dark, straight hair. Ordinarily, Ruiz wouldn't have looked at her twice, but here at this desolate weather station, she looked almost attractive.\nRebecca was supervising the setting up of the tents. After introductions were made, she took Ruiz to the far side of the station where she sat on some rocks overlooking the sea. \"I know what happened to Lon,\" she said.\n\"Go on.\"\n\"He used the hurricane as a cover for committing suicide. He wasn't a happy man, you know.\"\n\"I know. But he doesn't fit the suicide profile.\"\n\"Oh, all sorts of people commit suicide. He used the storm to cover it up so people wouldn't know. Lon and I were lovers. I got to know him quite well. He was always moody, but after I broke off our relationship, he got worse. He needed someone to care about him, and I turned him away. Really, I blame myself.\"\n\"Why hasn't anyone found the body?\"\n\"The storm could have ripped him to pieces. Or look at the sea. He could be out there somewhere.\"\n\"How did the relationship end?\"\nRebecca was standing up now. The wind was blowing through her long, straight hair. \"It just didn't work out. We weren't right for each other.\"\nRuiz stood up. \"What was it he said about you? Too suffocating? Was that it?\" Rebecca's shoulders slumped, but she didn't answer. \"He ended the affair, and you're the one who thinks about suicide. But don't do it yet. I may need to ask you some more questions\"\n\"I loved him,\" Rebecca said as Ruiz walked away. \"I would have done anything for him. Anything!\" Ruiz kept walking.\nManning's work area had been in the underground portion of the weather station, just above the shelter where the station's staff had waited out the storm. Unlike Manning's sleeping quarters, it had survived more or less intact. On the floor, there were a couple of inches of water that seeped into Ruiz's shoes. A bank of shorted out computers lined the wall to the right, a long work bench filled the middle of the room, and boxes were piled to the ceiling at the far end. A couple of temporary lights had been strung up over the computers, but nothing else appeared to have been touched.\nRuiz headed for the work bench. It was piled with electronic equipment, parts, and tools, some of it quite old. Underneath some parts from a disassembled weather probe, Ruiz found a couple of pages of handwritten notes. They looked like the start of a computer program, but the weather stations all used intelligent, self-programming computers. There was a moan from behind the boxes, and Ruiz quickly stuffed the pages into his pocket.\n\"Who's out there?\" asked a slurred voice.\nRuiz walked to the back of the room where a thin, glassy- eyed workman was huddled behind some empty crates. The man was dressed in dirty coveralls, and he wore a transmitter in his ear. \"You must be Eb,\" Ruiz sneered at the buzz head. \"This station must be home to all the rejects on Williwaw.\" Eb was the station's maintenance man. According to Ruiz's files, he was a rehabilitated buzz-head, but Ruiz had never put much faith in rehabilitation.\n\"Whuddya want?\"\nRuiz yanked the plug out of Eb's ear. \"You're the only one here who spent much time with Lon Manning. What do you know about what happened to him?\"\nEb rubbed his temples trying to bring back the high. \"He walked out into the storm. What else is there?\"\n\"When?\"\n\"I dunno. When the storm got quiet. When the whuddya call it was over the station.\"\n\"The eye. Why?\"\n\"I dunno. I gotta get to work.\"\n\"Why did he do it?\"\n\"He said he knew something about the storms. Why don't you leave me alone?\"\nRuiz reached down and pulled Eb up by his collar. \"You'll never work again if you don't answer my questions. Why did Lon leave the shelter?\"\n\"I said I dunno. Somethin' that would make him a big man. Can't I please go now?\"\n\"Anybody down here?\" The voice came from the door to the work area.\nRuiz dropped the shaking maintenance man and stepped out from behind the boxes. A technician was looking through the material on Lon's workbench. \"Oh, excuse me sir,\" he said. \"I'm just looking for some cable for our satellite link-up.\"\n\"I thought the monitors wouldn't be up for a few days,\" Ruiz said as he walked towards the tech.\n\"We have to get it running sooner than we expected. It looks like that big storm is headed back this way.\"\nRuiz left the work area and headed for his tent. Far out over the ocean the sky had grown dark. The hoppers had all gone, and a salty wind was blowing inland. Except for some technicians scurrying into the shelter erected that morning, the camp looked deserted.\nIn the tent, Ruiz flipped on a light and pulled out the papers he had lifted from Lon's workbench. They were notes for a computer program for the drones sent out to monitor storms, but Ruiz lacked the background to determine exactly what the program was supposed to accomplish. Copies of Lon's files at the home office were included and Ruiz plugged them into his computer. He had read them all before and remembered all that he had read, but having them in front of him again helped focus his attention. Little went on at any of the weather stations in Ruiz's jurisdiction that escaped his attention. All the data pointed to one thing: Lon was a quitter. He wasn't suicidal, and that reminded Ruiz that Rebecca's suicidal tendencies seemed to have gotten worse. He would have to file a new report on her. Lon wasn't a buzzer; Eb was the only addict at Rossenby. If he left the underground storm shelter when the eye of the storm was over the station, he might have been able to get to another shelter. But where would he go? To a cave nearby in the hills? He didn't seem the type to go native but maybe he would if he broke under the pressure of the planet.\nRuiz awoke to the sound of rain drumming on the tent. Eb was outside, gathering up debris that had blown out of the destroyed dome, and he looked suspiciously at Ruiz as the investigator approached.\n\"You went native a few years ago,\" Ruiz said.\n\"Yeah. For a while.\"\n\"Did you ever talk to Manning about it?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Eb answered. \"But Lon wouldn't have gone native.\"\n\"Why did you come back?\"\nEb shrugged. \"It didn't feel right. I felt like a parasite living where I didn't belong.\" He pointed to the mountains that overlooked Rossenby.\nRuiz had never understood why some settlers went native. They left their settlements and went up into the hills where they lived alone in crude huts. If they were responsible, they could live like that for years. The few who had been interviewed said they wanted to become part of the planet, but some, like Eb, came back saying they didn't fit in. What was there to fit in to?\nRuiz left Eb and headed for the temporary command center. The crew was silently huddled around a row of computer monitors. As Ruiz entered the cluttered shelter, Captain Wall separated himself from his crew.\n\"Well,\" he said. \"Now you'll get to see what you think Manning walked into. The storm that hit us so hard moved one day out to sea, stalled, and now its coming back.\"\n\"It is getting rough out there.\"\n\"This is nothing. We should really start to feel it in a few hours.\"\n\"Shouldn't we get in the shelter if that storm is coming back?\"\nWall shrugged his shoulders. \"We will if the storm passes over us. It still might turn away.\"\n\"You people should be able to predict these storms,\" Ruiz said. \"What have you been doing?\"\n\"Nobody can predict the storms. You know that.\" Wall started to walk towards the computers. \"Sometimes I think this whole damn planet is alive and hates me.\"\nRuiz walked back to his tent to get his notes. The wind was at his back and pushed him along. This storm seemed to exist solely to cover Manning's tracks: it was here when Manning disappeared and it came back when Ruiz was trying to track down Manning. Ruiz pulled his notes and his computer out of the tent. As he turned back to the larger shelter, a gust of wind tore his tent loose and it was whipped across the compound.\n\"I don't have time to talk.\" Back at the command center, Ruiz was trying to talk to Rebecca, but she was monitoring the storm's progress.\n\"You don't have a choice. As soon as I track down Manning, I'll be out of your hair.\"\n\"I've got a job to do, Mister. Go bother somebody else.\"\n\"It's okay, Rebecca,\" Captain Wall said. \"The techs will let you know if anything happens in the next few minutes.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Ruiz said sarcastically. He led Rebecca to the far corner of the building and took out the papers he had found on Lon's workbench. \"What are these?\"\nRebecca sighed and took her eyes away from the monitors. \"Notes for a computer program. Are these Lon's?\" Ruiz didn't answer. \"It looks like he was reprogramming the probes.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don't know. We get those from Central all ready to fire off. It looks like he wanted the probe to broadcast on a different frequency. Here's the wavelength he wanted to use.\" Rebecca circled a figure.\n\"Why that frequency?\"\n\"I don't know. It's one we never use on Williwaw. There's too much natural interference. Sunspots or something.\"\nRuiz took the papers back. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"I'll be in Manning's work area for awhile.\"\nLittle had been done to clean up the exometoerologist's workshop. Boxes still filled the back of the room, and the workbench was still cluttered with equipment. Next to the workbench was a locked cabinet that Ruiz had not gotten to the first time he went through Manning's effects. It was a low-tech padlock, and Ruiz quickly pried it off. Inside, along with some expensive computer equipment, was an old fashioned radio.\nRuiz hooked up the radio and tuned it to the frequency Rebecca had circled. There was a lot of static, but as he adjusted the antenna, a familiar pattern could be heard above the rest: three long, three short, three long.\n\"Lon! You're back!\" Eb came stumbling out from behind the boxes. He staggered to a halt as he saw Ruiz. \"Whuddya want this time?\"\n\"Did Lon use this much?\"\n\"Yeah, sometimes. Why?\"\n\"That's an SOS signal. I think he's in some trouble. Where's the mike?\"\n\"Ain't no mike. Lon used it to send those dots and dashes.\"\n\"Morse Code!\" Ruiz exploded. \"Nobody uses that anymore.\"\n\"He even made me learn it,\" Eb said proudly. \"Said I might need it sometime.\"\nRuiz grabbed Eb's arm. \"Quick. Answer him. Find out where he is.\"\nEb fished a keypad out of the cabinet and plugged it into the radio. Slowly, he tapped out a message then listened to the reply. Outside, the wind was howling louder, and inside, the lights dimmed.\n\"I musta missed part of that,\" Eb said. \"He's sayin' he's in the storm.\"\n\"What's he in? A boat or a plane?\"\nAs Eb tapped out the question, the rest of the crew entered the room, their clothing soaked with rain. \"We'll have to go below,\" Captain Wall said to the two men. \"The storm's getting worse.\"\n\"He said it again,\" Eb said to Ruiz over the sound of the crew tramping down to the lower level. \"He said he is the storm.\"\nRuiz walked to the stairway and looked up at the ruined weather station. The rain stung his face, as he watched the winds whip the debris across the plateau. Rebecca and the techs pushed past him to get down to the shelter. Captain Wall took his arm, but Ruiz shook him off. \"The storms are alive,\" he said to himself. \"The whole damn planet's alive.\"\n\"Excuse me,\" Eb said as he stepped by, his voice clear and firm. \"I'm going with him. Lon promised he'd come back for me if he found a way. If he found a way to live on this planet without feeling like a leech.\" Eb's voice trailed off as he climbed the steps, and he whispered the last words.\nRuiz watched as Eb walked into the hurricane.\nMaurice Forrester lives in Syracuse with his wife, Lori, and three year old son, John. He is a Ph.D. student in the history department at Syracuse University where he is doing research on American religious Perfectionism and antebellum reform.\nmjforres@suvm.acs.syr.edu","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

It was the city's way of saying he had spent enough time in the shower already.\n\"Hot water ration nearing end.\" The shower warned him. It always disquieted Teri to have a machine talk to him while he bathed.\n\"Water off.\" He said, when the water was too frigid to bear. \"Drier on.\"\nThe stainless steel walls slid away revealing large vents which blew warm air over him. When his drying ration was exhausted, he dressed in his robe and stepped out of the Water Closet. Teri surveyed his apartment, till he found the dinner table which had been accumulating a pile of mailchips all that week. With a comfortable scratch and a yawn he settled in a chair beneath the pile.\n\"Coffee, black.\" The food dispenser processed the request and offered him a mug.\n\"Thank you. Now let's see.\" He took the first chip, and read \"Sale at Sojki\" The chip tumbled through the air, landing in the open disposal unit.\n\"Blasted junk mail.\" As he sifted through the other chips, the Sojki chip gained company. Teri stopped his hoopshooting long enough to view a chip from his Aunt.\n\"Hello, Teri. How are you? I had hoped to hear from you, but I guess you were too busy to worry about your poor old Aunt...\" She always enjoyed making him feel guilty, and she was good at it. \"... I don't blame you, you probably have some girl you're seeing that is taking up all of your time...\" She was also in a hurry to get him married, not exactly what he was planning. \"... well, you be sure to sent me a chip. Love and Kisses.\" Teri watched the face pucker, then he added her chip his score.\n\"Important Message From a Friend\" It sounded important enough, so he popped it in.\n\"Greetings customer, let me show you...\" The face of a businessman polluted the screen, but it never finished its sentence.\n\"Getting sneaky aren't we.\" Two more points.\nTeri picked up the next chip and dropped it as if it bit him. It was marked with the official symbol of the Protectorate. There was to need for further identification.\nA stern face filled the screen, while behind him the presidential seal covered the wall.\n\"This is the President of the Protectorate Council. I am informing you that you have been selected to receive the honor of serving as part of the Protectorate Galactic Marine Corp. You are to follow the proceeding instructions exactly. Failure to do so can be punishable by 40 years imprisonment or permanent exile. Thank you, and remember to vote Liberal.\" The face broke into a smile and disappeared. Teri felt faint.\nThe next face belonged to a uniformed officer who had a friendly air about him.\n\"Mr. Teri M. Demsy,\" Patriotic music began in the background. \"You have been chosen to wear the uniform of the finest army in the galaxy, the Galactic Marine Corps.\" The screen changed to a line of uniformed men at attention. \"You will be trained in the latest weaponry. \" The screen showed a firing range. \"You will be given the opportunity to visit exotic planets.\" Pictures of popular tourist attractions on several planets were shown. \"In short, Mr. Demsy, you will become one of the few, the proud, the GMC. You are scheduled to begin training at seven thirty hours at Fort Reagan, April 4, 2054. I must remind you of the consequences should you refuse to appear at the appointed time. Standard punishment is 40 years in prison or permanent exile to an outer planet. I'm sure you don't want this Mr. Demsy.\" The final picture shown was the Protectorate flag, flying in the breeze. The officer's smiling face covered the screen once more. \"We look forward to seeing you Mr. Demsy.\" The screen went blank.\nTeri glanced at his watch: April 2nd, two more days to live the rest of his life.\nWith the war between the Protectorate and the Federation at its present stage, he would be killed within a year. If he didn't join, he would face imprisonment or worse- exile to a frozen planet where he would slowly starve or freeze. There would be little chance to escape the Protectorate if he decided to run since they control the entire planet. He would be continuously running from Administrators. That he disliked more than death. No one could decide how they wanted to die in two days.\nThe hands of his watch read 3:42 am. Teri could remember the day his grandfather gave it to him, describing how old it was. Since the Protectorate outlawed analog watches long before Teri was born, it must be old. His grandfather speculated its age somewhere before the revolution. However old, it was Teri's only conscious offense against the Protectorate, and he cherished it. He rarely wore it outside his apartment, because, if seen, he would spend the next five years in prison.\nThe apartment was still the way he left it when he viewed the chip, except for an absence of light. He didn't work that day, instead, he slumped in his quiet room, lost in thought.\nIt was almost two o'clock when he awoke. He couldn't remember falling asleep, but was grateful he had.\nTeri began all the necessary arrangements. By three, he had all his belongings packed and informed the landlord he was moving. By four, he had reservations on a shuttle to Fort Reagan, nine thirty that night, and had sent his luggage to the airport. By five, he removed his savings for the First Bank of the Protectorate, seven years worth. With this done, and his room vacant, he had time to waste.\nTeri had always wanted to dine at a restaurant where they still prepare food by hand, but he could never afford to. Although the Protectorate did not approve of this unsanitary practice, they tolerated it because it proved itself profitable. So, with a pleasant lump of bank credits in his pocket, and his grandfather's watch proudly displayed on his wrist, he set off to find one.\nOutside the apartment, Teri hailed a personal transport instead of public transit.\n\"Destination please.\" The mechanical voice of the driver asked.\n\"The nearest restaurant where they serve food by hand.\" He said hoping the computer understood the request. It did and the transport zipped out into traffic. Teri was enjoying the speed at which the transport was moving. It eventually slowed and stopped before La Brunch restaurant.\n\"Please insert 39 credits.\" With a shrug, he deposited a day's work.\nThe restaurant was magnificent. It exceeded everything Teri had imagined. There were people, real people, standing, sitting, walking, talking, dancing, serving, being served, and enjoying themselves. Just like those Protectorate movies showing how wonderful the system is, where everyone is smiling, but this was really happening.\nA man dressed in the customary waiter's tuxedo approached him.\n\"Do you have a reservation?\"\n\"No I was hoping you would have a vacancy.\"\n\"I'm afraid we are booked at the moment, try later.\"\nTeri had little practice at bribery, and didn't know how much to give him, so he decided to give him the first credit that came out of his pocket. The five hundred credit piece helped the waiter find a vacant table.\nHe ordered, and watched the as people dance. The waiter returned with his meal, and turned to leave.\n\"Wait a minute.\" The waiter paused.\n\"Yes sir. May I help you?\"\n\"I don't suppose you could find me a bottle of wine.\"\n\"Sir we don't serve such things here! That is against the law...\"\n\"I would be most generous.\" Again he, played lotto with the credits.\nThe waiters eyes widened when the next piece was handed to him. \"I'll see what I can do.\" With that he hurried to the kitchen. Teri savored the tender meat, prepared by a fascinating process which the waiter had described as \"broiling.\" The waiter returned with a bottle, stripped of all labels. Teri found that the wine and meat went together very well, so he thanked the waiter with another \"tip.\" The night went on, and the last memory Teri had of that night was asking for another bottle.\nWhen he awoke, he noticed how hard the floor seemed, and wondered why it was so close. He flipped onto his back, and realized he was lying down. He sat up, but the dizziness made him lie down again.\n\"Where am I?\" He asked the ceiling, but there was no answer. He noticed a smell, like vomit, but he couldn't locate its source.\nThe room was familiar, but he couldn't quite place it. Perhaps because he was lying on the floor. That must be it. He flopped upright and with practice, managed to keep his balance. He was in his apartment, that's where he was. How long was I unconscious? He wondered. Then Teri remembered his flight. He looked at his watch, eight twenty. There was still time to shower and get rid of this nasty smell.\nTeri locked the room after he cleaning off his sample of the floor's dirt. He shuffled down the hall towards his destiny.\n\"Going somewhere?\" Since he didn't did not recognize the voice he froze, and slowly turned to face a Protectorate Administrator.\n\"Yes, um, I'm um I have to catch a shuttle.\"\n\"You are not going anywhere, Mr. Demsy.\"\n\"What do you mean, and how do you know my name?\"\n\"That is irrelevant. You had your chance to go on a shuttle ride, Mr. Demsy. You chose not to. I'm afraid you must pay the consequences.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" He glanced at his watch. \"Its only eight twe...\" Teri's jaw dropped. The watches hands were frozen at 8:21 pm. His most cherished object had betrayed him.\nStenciled in red letters across the cell's only cement wall were the words:\n\"Absolutely no talking permitted\"\nBelow it were several other sentences written in some other dialects, which Teri assumed said the same thing.\nThe cell itself consisted of three bare walls and a fourth of cement. It was vacant of all furniture except one blanket for each of its three occupants.\nThe first of Teri's cellmates wore the majority of a flight suit mixed with other casual wear. He had traced his name in the air with his finger until everyone knew him as Reihn Verice.\nThe other was wearing the long white jacket of a doctor. It took some time for Teri to realize he was actually a scientist of some sort. Teri found his name rather interesting too, Samual Johnson. He and the pilot were attempting to communicate using hand gestures. Teri tried as well but soon lost interest. He was still awaiting his impending doom.\nTeri awoke to the harsh voice of the guard.\n\"Teri Demsy, your lawyer is here to see you. You gonna get up or should I tell him to go away.\" The guard chuckled.\nTeri opened his mouth to reply, then remembered the sign on the wall. His mouth snapped shut before sound could escape and he stood by the door being unlocking.\nThe guard lead him down a long grey corridor lined with empty cells identical to the one Teri had occupied. They turned a corner and walked through a steel door. Inside was a room no bigger than his cell. Unlike his cell, however, the room had privacy and furniture. Behind a table in the center of the room sat his only hope, the public defender. He was tapping away at his portable console, but did take enough time to direct Teri to the seat opposite him. The guard locked the door behind them, just as the lawyer began to speak.\n\"Mr. Teri Ran Demsy, age 28, weight 153, brown hair, blue eyes, No previous record. What are you doing here, Mr. Demsy?\"\n\"I...\"\n\"Mr. Demsy, please don't interrupt. As I was saying, you are being held, pending judgement, for the crime of treason...\"\n\"Treason...\"\n\"Yes treason, and they have a pretty good case against you. Now tell me, why didn't you report on time?\"\n\"I uh, I was incapacitated at the time.\"\n\"Incapacitated.\"\n\"Yes uh,\" Teri began to turn a rose shade of red. \"I was drunk.\"\nThe lawyer's expression remained constant.\n\"This does not make my job any easier, Mr. Demsy. You expect me to walk into that courtroom and say `please excuse my client, he was drunk, but he promises never to do it again.' Being in possession of alcohol alone carries a five year sentence. No way, Mr. Demsy. You would be sent to the far reaches of space, and I'd probably be sent right behind you.\"\nThe lawyer turned back to his console and tapped away for some time. He sighed and looked back at Teri.\n\"At least you have a clean record. You've even helped the protectorate while you were an accountant. Maybe with a little persuasion, and luck, I can get you enlisted again with a few fines and a couple months in the stockade.\"\n\"I would appreciate that very much.\"\n\"Don't take this personally. If I don't make my quota, I'll lose my position. That's why you're getting my best.\"\nThe guard had led him back to his cell after his meeting. With a grunt, he slammed the door behind Teri, loud enough to wake the scientist and the pilot. With an unpleasant chuckle, he shuffled on.\nTeri sat wrapped in his blanket in the corner, wondering what would become of him. Right now, the Marine Corps seemed the most pleasant of all the choices. He had often wondered what it would be like. If he tried hard enough he could actually make a decent life out of it, assuming that he lived to enjoy it. Teri decided that was exactly what he was going to do make the best of it.\nAgain, the guard escorted Teri from his cell and down the hallway. Instead of visiting the tiny room, they continued further to a large wooden door labeled Criminal Court. Teri entered the room expecting to see a large number of people. At the table in the center of the room sat his attorney, tapping away again.\n\"Come in and sit down, Mr. Demsy. We have just enough time to review your case again before court begins.\" The lawyer said without looking up from his console Teri seat next to the lawyer.\n\"Now, Mr. Demsy, what we are planning to do may seem a little risky, so if you're nervous I understand.\" He wasn't, and he didn't understand why. \"Now let's go over the game plan.\"\n\"Yes, let's\"\n\"Ok, first, you will plead guilty to treason by trying to escape the draft. Second, you present your spotless record, along with your aunt as a character witness. And, finally, you ask that you be enlisted in the marines with whatever punishment they see fit to deliver.\"\n\"Sounds good to me.\" It should, he had been thinking about it all that night.\n\"Ok, now we wait.\"\nAfter waiting for five minutes, Teri began to wonder if anyone would show up. He also wondered where they would sit. There was no other furniture other that the table and the two chairs. The room itself didn't look like what he pictured it to be. Although it was a spacious room, it was not decorative at all. The walls were an off white color, almost transparent. As he was examining the walls, one lit with a beam of light from some unknown source. The light focused into a face which spoke.\n\"Please stand.\" They both obeyed. \"This Criminal Court is now in session, the Honorary Greod Hjery residing.\" On the wall directly in front of them, five more faces appeared. To their right, another face appeared.\n\"That's our real opponent.\" The lawyer whisper.\nThe central face in front of them began to speak.\n\"We are here to judge one Teri R. Demsy for the crime of treason. Will he please step forward.\" Teri did so. \"How do you plead.\"\nWith a hard swallow, he answered.\n\"Guilty.\"\n\"Very well, you may sit.\" The face look to the other wall. \"Mr. Prosecutor, you may begin.\"\nThe face to their right began speaking.\n\"Thank you your honor.\" The face glanced at the table then at the five faces. \"Honorable Judges, I'll make this short. I intend to show this court that Teri Demsy is not some ordinary treason case. Indeed not. Don't be fooled by his innocent looking exterior, for inside lurks a beast. I will show you facts and evidence which will reveal his true identity. Thank you.\"\nTeri couldn't believe his ears. Was all this really happening? His attorney stood.\n\"Honorable Judges. My client is a decent man who made a mistake. He now realizes the error in what he has done and wishes to rectify the situation. Please don't close your hearts to him. Thank you.\"\nThe central face spoke again.\n\"Mr. Defense, you may present your case.\"\nTeri's lawyer proceeded with his presentation exactly as they planned. He showed Teri's clean record. He displayed Teri's willingness to enlist. He even brought Teri's aunt in as a character witness. Then the prosecutor began his presentation.\n\"Honorable Judges. I would like to point out a few items that my esteemed collogue failed to mention. First, Mr. Demsy is no ordinary case. He must be recognized for what he really is, a treasonous spy. Second, we must find out just what happened on that mysterious night. And lastly, I will give you my final proof that he is a spy, and a traitor to the Protectorate.\"\nTeri looked his lawyer with a confused expression, only to meet another.\n\"I call to the stand Mr. Demsy, since he is the only one who can tell us what really happened.\" Teri slowly stood and walking in front of the table.\n\"Mr Demsy, please recount what happened to you from the time you received notification on your enlistment to the time you were arrested.\"\n\"Well, I had not gone through my mail all that week...\"\n\"... and so I closed my account at the bank and decided to splurge a little.\"\n\"Wasn't it true that you went to a Manual Food Preparation Restaurant?\"\n\"Yes, but I had never been...\"\n\"And isn't it true that you bought alcohol from the waiter, and drank to excess.\"\n\"Yes, but...\"\n\"There are no buts about it Mr. Demsy. You have committed two crimes. You drank until you were drunk, and because of that, you missed your shuttle. Isn't that true Mr. Demsy?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThere was a pause, probably to allow the words to take effect.\n\"Mr. Demsy, are you a spy?\"\n\"What?\n\"Simply answer the question.\"\n\"No, I am certainly not a spy.\"\nThe prosecutor held something up.\n\"Do you recognize this, Mr. Demsy?\"\nAgain, Teri swallowed hard.\n\"Yes, it's my grandfather's watch.\"\n\"I see you know it very well then. I suppose you know how the transmitter got inside it.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The transmitter. We found a transmitter in your watch. I suppose you know nothing about it?\"\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\"How long have you had this watch? And, I would like the judges to notice it's analog.\"\n\"About twenty years.\"\n\"That's a long time breaking the law. In all that time you never opened it? Not ever to replace the battery?\"\n\"I've only opened it once. To change the battery like you said.\"\nTeri's lawyer stood and said.\n\"I think this has gone far enough.\"\n\"Yes, it has.\" The prosecutor replied. \"Mr. Demsy, you are lying. You have been playing games form the start. You are really a Federation spy.\" The lawyer still went on despite Teri's furious head shaking. \"You have been sent here by the Federation with a perfect record so no one would be suspicious, and report periodically on our economic status using this transmitter.\" He held up a tiny black chip. \"We had it analyzed Mr. Demsy. It was made by the Federation.\"\nTeri was speakless. The only word he could utter was \"no.\" His attorney was equally at a loss.\n\"Well Mr. Demsy, can you explain?\"\n\"No, I don't know anything about it.\"\n\"I have no more questions, you may sit down\" Teri slumped back into his chair. The prosecution rests it's case your honor.\"\n\"Why didn't you tell me about the watch?\" Teri's lawyer whispered.\n\"Well, it was taken from me when I was arrested. I didn't know anything about any transmitter.\"\n\"Well, Mr. Demsy, looks like we are going for a trip.\" The lawyer stood. \"The defense rests your Honor.\"\n\"Very well, this court will adjourn while we decide.\" All faces disappeared.\n(to be continued...)\nThomas Hand is a freshman at Penn State Schuykill Haven Campus.

Today he would uncover Brian's hidden secrets and reveal to him the true nature of reality. Today, thought Dr. Scott, would be a new beginning for Brian Realis.\nDr. Scott drove quickly through the pouring rain to the clinic that morning. He arrived on time and quickly reviewed Brian's file. He then left his office and walked down the corridor to the Therapy Room. The nurse exited the room and informed Dr. Scott that Brian was already inside. Dr. Scott hesitated for a few seconds, took a deep breath and stepped into the room. Brian was there, sitting alone and waiting for the world to end. The clock bells outside heralded the arrival of nine o'clock.\nDr. Scott strode across the carpet and seated himself across from his patient. Brian gave no acknowledgment of the doctor's presence and continued to stare blankly into space. Despite this, Dr. Scott was still sure that the breakthrough would be today. He looked Brian straight in the eye and, with a little smile, began their daily session.\n\"Hello, Brian. How are we feeling today?\"\n\"Well, I can't say for you, but as for myself I'm feeling the same as I do tomorrow.\"\n\"Well, Brian, I feel fine. But what do you mean by `the same as I do tomorrow.'?\"\n\"I mean tomorrow. What you call the day after today.\"\n\"What makes you so sure of how you will feel tomorrow?\"\n\"For I can see the future,\" replied Brian, \"and I know what is going to happen. Tomorrow will be the same as today. It always is. But tomorrow you will no longer be able to `help' me. As if I needed your `help' in the first place.\"\nDr. Scott was undaunted. His attitude was still positive; the breakthrough, he thought, would still be today. Because today was one of the few days Brian had actually talked, which meant that something significant was going to happen. Dr. Scott decided to ask a question which earlier Brian had been reluctant to talk about.\n\"Brian, let's talk about the past instead of the future. Tell me about the day of the accident.\"\n\"It was a day like any other,\" Brian began, \"except that today I was to make human history. But the day was the culmination of many years of work, and the story of it really begins many years ago when I was just out of college.\n\"As I told you before, I began working at the Wheeler Institute of Sub-Quantum Studies. My colleagues and I were conducting physics research at the Planck level. As you know, there is a point at which reality breaks down in Quantum Mechanics. Once one looks at a small enough scale, the fundamental aspects of space-time break down. Reality and the physical laws with which we describe it cease to exist. The only thing left is a space-time pre-geometry composed of probability and imaginary numbers. It was a level which took 200 pages to describe mathematically and impossible to describe physically. It was a level at which the universe stopped trying to fool us and simply disappeared into the nothingness state from which it sprang. And here we were, some of the countries' most brilliant minds, prancing around, giving talks and doing experiments and performing mathematical hand-waving like we knew what we were talking about. It was all so presumptuous of us that we could understand something which was beyond the realm of experience. But we were young and cocky, and no one else doubted our work, because they too couldn't understand it. And so we continued our vacuous verbiage about the `true nature of reality' and let the blind lead the blind until we fell into the pit.\n\"We discovered these little `pockets' of pre-geometry; a sort-of `Quantum Foam' which permeated all of space-time. Steve called them `realitons' since they were the ultimate constituents of our reality. We discovered that they were the `hidden variable' called for in the theories and that they traveled much, much faster than the speed of light. They were the solution to Bell's Theorem and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox.\n\"We also discovered that they could be excited to resonate at a specific frequency. We discovered that whenever we tried to measure the excited state, the realiton absorbed the energy and re-emitted it thousands of feet away. It wasn't until the scientists in the material science lab started dying from acute radiation exposure did we realize what was happening.\n\"Whenever a realiton was excited, it dematerialized whatever was nearby in its space-time region and transported in instantaneously (well, almost) across reality, rematerializing whatever was in its space-time pre-geometry wave packet when it fell back to its ground state. That's when we got the idea: what if we used these realitons as a means of transport? Just excite them, hitch a ride, and be materialized quickly across vast distances. The distance traveled could easily be controlled by the frequency of the realiton vibration. Light-years could be crossed in less time than it takes to go to the bathroom. The problems of interstellar space travel were solved!\n\"So we tried testing it over small distances. First inanimate objects, then live plants, then small animals, etc. We took tons of physical data and saw that everything came through perfectly, exactly as it was before. No being turned inside-out or being dispersed across the solar system that you hear from the science-fiction writers. This was safe, fast, and not too expensive. All that was left was to try it out on a human being.\n\"Naturally, I volunteered. Oh sure, there were complaints and demonstrations and debates on safety, but everybody knew it had to be tested, and no one else wanted to take my place as volunteer. So the day came, and I was sealed up in the transportation chamber, all ready to take a trip a step out less than a nanosecond later thousands of miles away. Everything was fine. Until they hit the switch.\n\"Now don't get me wrong. Technically the experiment was a success. Everything went on schedule and without a hitch; no power outages or computer glitches to foul things up.\n\"But we had neglected something. The human psyche is a fragile thing. Although we knew what happened physically when we did the transportation, how were we to even guess what it felt like experientially? We had no idea. I had no idea. And I jumped straight into hell.\n\"How can I describe what it was like? Like trying to describe color to a blind man, the concept cannot be related. All I can say is that the split-second physically was an eternity psychologically. I experienced the whole of the universe in that time. The animals, of course, were unaffected, for they are not conscious or self-aware. But the human mind, you see, contains itself as a self-referent concept. And when that truth is shattered by a look from the reference point of the divine, when one sees reality as it truly is, the whole idea of the concept of the universe, as well as the concept of the self, becomes a farce. To look upon the face of truth and see only nonexistence is truly enough to drive a man mad. At least for a while. But I have sorted out my mind, now, and can fully accept the truth of reality. I am beyond the stage of madness.\"\nDr. Scott, who had been listening quietly the entire time, suddenly leapt upon Brian's last few words. \"So you feel we really are making progress?\" he asserted.\n\"Progress is an illusion,\" Brian replied quickly. \"We change, but we never get anywhere; we never make any progress. So really, nothing changes. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Things. A thing is subject to change. In fact, things seem to be undergoing constant change. But when a thing changes, it is no longer what it was once before. It's not the same thing.\"\n\"But all of the traits of an object do not change,\" interrupted Dr. Scott. He quickly jotted down Brian's reference to things on a notepad. \"There are overall criteria for classification which do not change,\" he continued. \"The overall essence of an object is retained. Most changes involve incidental traits, which are unimportant in the larger scheme.\"\n\"But all changes have an effect,\" explained Brian, \"no matter how small or trivial. Nothing is insignificant; these minor changes add up over the lifetime of a given thing. And since schemes of classification are purely arbitrary, a thing can be defined in any way, thus exposing its subtle changes. The overall essence changes relative to the observer. Since the common essence of all things is existence, the existence also changes relative to the observer. Quantum Mechanics demonstrated the importance of the observer in defining the universe a century ago. But as I pointed out earlier, we don't really change; we only seem to. Therefore we all don't exist.\"\nDr. Scott, however, was quick to respond to the philosophical conclusions of Brian's twisted logic. \"Or we do exist, Brian. By your own logic it can be either. That's where you lose reality. Both conclusions are equally correct and possible, but only one applies in our case. We know we exist because WE KNOW we know we exist.\"\n\"But even if we really do exist,\" replied Brian, \"then change causes a change in our existence. Our existence is therefore fleeting, and we soon become non-existent. If existence defines reality, then non-existence defines non-reality, or nothingness. But nothing is not nothing if it is definable. Thus the paradox of reality and existence. To avoid this paradox, one is forced to conclude one does not exist.\"\nDr. Scott scribbled on his notepad while Brian talked. `Coming to grips with his own mortality. The breakthrough is close at hand.' He then waited while Brian continued his speech.\n\"But in the end,\" Brian sighed, \"I am no longer one of you. I can see it all for what it truly is. It only seems that you know you know you exist. In the end, reality is but an illusion, a cruel lie; the universe is a figment of its own imagination. And upon realizing this, the universe is forced to accept its own non-existence. The end of the universe is close at hand. And since I am not one of you, my existence will continue, while yours shall cease.\"\nDr. Scott realized he had reached a dead end. He sighed and wrote slowly on his notepad. `Back to thinking he's immortal. He is drifting further from reality. I will have to retrace the conversation and try from another route.' The doctor consulted notes he had made earlier, and tried again.\n\"Brian,\" began Dr. Scott, \"you talked about `things' a moment ago. Exactly what qualifies as things?\"\n\"Something. Anything. Everything. Nothing. A glass of water, for instance. I happen to be thirsty.\"\n\"That's okay, I'll get you one.\"\n\"No thanks,\" replied Brian, \"I'll just drink this.\"\nDr. Scott stared at the glass of water as Brian drank it. It hadn't been there a moment ago. \"Where did you get that?\" he drilled.\n\"From beyond reality. I wanted it, I reached beyond reality, and I got it. It was always here, really. But the illusion of reality hid it from your view.\"\nDr. Scott became desperate. \"Brian, listen to yourself. You can't really believe what you're saying. I know you must have had that glass hidden somewhere; stop fooling yourself.\"\n\"It was hidden,\" replied Brian, \"by reality. I wanted it; I reached beyond the veil of reality; I got it. All of those `things' I mentioned lie beyond the illusion veil of reality. It is you who are being fooled. For in the end, I am reality. I can get anything I want. And I say reality doesn't exist.\"\n`Megalomania. Illusions of reali...' scribble scribble erase `grandeur confused about whether he exists or not. It doesn't look good.' Dr. Scott noted these thoughts, then asked Brian a new question.\n\"What is it you REALLY want, Brian?\"\nBrian Realis thought for a moment, smiled, and then replied:\n\"I just want it all to stop.\"\nIt did.\nBruce Woodcock is a sophomore at Purdue University, majoring in Physics, and is one of the world's last romantics.

Let us out! Let us out!'' shriek the blades of the battered fan, clanking rhythmically against their prison of dented wire and trying in vain to stir up a breeze in the soupy air. Izzy Arnold's boom box blasts out an endless stream of chicken-shit music from the concrete stoop five floors below and a bunch of snot-nosed kids are playing noisily in the vacant lot across the street. No wonder I'm accomplishing el zilcho on the dissertation today. The integrals don't converge, the model is crude, I'm sick to death of it and it's all a pile of crap anyway. I mean, who gives a damn about the connection between convective dredge-up and stellar abundance anomalies? Not me, that's for sure, and it's MY dissertation. Izzy, Izzy, you don't know how close to death you are at this moment, you meathead.\nIt's useless. I open my third and last can of Coors and go to the window, which is stuck open almost halfway by layer upon layer of dull green paint. Perhaps if I try hard enough I can conjure up an icy mountain stream or a pine forest, deep, cool, and silent except for the muted sound of my passage along the thick carpet of needles, the fragrance of resin. But no such luck. Across the street is a small abandoned lot, strewn with large boulders and chunks of concrete, broken glass and weeds. My fantasy pine glade is nothing but a few scraggly trees that have somehow managed to maintain a foothold in the packed, sandy soil, and the rising currents of hot air bring to my nostrils the mingled aromas of frying onions and uncollected garbage.\nMercifully, the cacaphonous squawkings from Izzy's stereo fade as he and his friends boogey on down the sidewalk toward the corner delicatessen, where they will probably hang out until dinnertime. As the raucous noise fades so does some of my irritation, and even the kids playing their stupid kids' games among the rocks and broken beer bottles don't annoy me as much as they did just a few moments ago. It's not their fault that this seedy lot is the closest thing to a playground that they have. Surprised, I find myself humming a few bars from Cat Stevens' _Where Do the Children Play?_ Well, I was a bratty kid myself, once upon a time. If I try very hard I can recall some pleasant moments from my early years---it wasn't all fighting with my sister and brother, and hating school, and being told you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do that and you'd better buckle down or you'll never go to college and why are you so moody, Jackie my boy? But mostly it WAS those things, and feeling angry and misunderstood. Well, here I am, stuck in this lousy sweatbox with no more beer in the refrigerator, with six years of my life spent studying physics so that I can author some useless treatise on stellar evolution (which no one will ever read), and across the street there are these kids who don't know a lick about mixing length theory or roundoff error, who don't seem to be affected by the heat and who, dammit, seem to be having a hell of a lot more fun than I ever had as a kid. With a shock of honesty, I realize that I am envious. From my lofty perch five floors above and twenty years beyond them I view the world in a light so totally alien to theirs that I may as well be from another planet. Why ARE you so moody, Jack?\nFinally, the heat gets to me and I must brave the street to fetch another six-pack. The elevator deposits me in the lobby, cavernous and dimly lit, smelling faintly of cats and laundry soap. I linger by my mailbox, scanning the junk mail and savoring a last moment of coolness---but if I hang around too long I'll most likely run into Mrs. Gunderson. I am in no mood today to suffer her inexhaustible supply of complaints and sad tribulations.\nLeaving the building, I notice that there are eight or ten kids in the lot across the street, each perched atop one of the many large boulders scattered among the weeds. I recognize some of them from my walks through the neighborhood. The girl on the largest boulder is Hector Munoz's ten year old, Ana. She has long, dark hair and a pretty, though serious, no-nonsense face. Hector had come to repair a leak in the kitchen plumbing not too long ago and he had brought her along. ``Would you like some milk and cookies while your father works on the faucet?'' I had offered, just trying to be nice, but I was answered with a hard, unsmiling look. ``Ana is a better plumber than I am,'' Hector had said, winking conspiratorially, but from her reaction I knew that I had just been dismissed as another dumb adult who probably thought that girls should stay at home and play with dolls and learn how to sew.\nThese kids are putting an enormous amount of energy into their game, whatever it is, wailing like the Banshee herself and waving sticks through the torpid air. The sight stops me in momentary amazement. One of them sees me and calls out to the others---an intruder, a spy in the camp! But no, what's this? Expecting hostile faces, I am surprised when some of the youngsters laugh and wave. Two boys clamber down from their boulders and come running over. I recognize them now as the Peterson twins from apartment 5-E. I have played handball with their father once or twice, though you could hardly call us friends. One of them looks up at me, squinting in the harsh sunlight. ``Could you be Gordon the Terrible?'' he pleads. ``Could you?'' Is he really asking me to join their game? This is absurd.\n``Gordon who?'' I laugh, playing along for the moment.\n``Gordon Samatar!'' pipes in the other, mock fear in his voice. ``Gordon the Terrible, we call him. He's the bad guy, the leader of the Black Knights!''\nAgain I surprise myself. Instead of immediately refusing, telling them I'm too busy with this or that, I hesitate. This is a mistake, for kids are experts at the game of badgering weak-willed adults. ``It's pretty hot out here,'' I offer lamely.\nOne of the boys (I don't remember their names and can't tell them apart anyway) points to a large, soot-blackened boulder in the slightly elevated southern corner of the lot, well separated from the other rocks and in the partial shade of a few scrub oak. ``That's his horse,'' he insists, brushing away my objection. ``All you gotta do is sit on that rock. Please!''\nWell, why not? All I had really wanted was relief from the closeness of my four walls. The work on the dissertation was going nowhere anyway, and the trip to the deli for beer was probably just an excuse to get out and move around. Did I really want to play Darth Vader in silly a kids' game, though? Feeling just a little dumb I say, ``Okay, boys, I guess I have a few minutes.''\n``No! We don't want him. He'll ruin the game!'' Ana Munoz jumps down from her boulder and rushes over to us, her inky black hair streaming behind her as she runs, her angry eyes blazing with unexpected fury. Why does this girl hate me so? Just because I offered her cookies, once upon a time? It is obviously time for me to leave.\n``Ana, shut up!'' says her brother, Lu`is, who has come running after her. He is somewhat younger than his sister but slightly taller. ``Mister, don't pay any attention to her. Just `cause she's the queen when we play she thinks she's the boss all the time. No way, Jos`e.''\nThe last thing I want is to be in the middle of a bunch of bickering kids, especially as the focus of their disagreement. The girl is right, though---I am already ruining their game. Like the scientist who wants only to observe nature, but who must always interact with it in order to do so, all I had done was stop for a moment to watch and now here I am in the thick of it. I start to back away, ignorant of the crimes I am guilty of in that child's eyes. But suddenly I am overcome by a long-forgotten bitterness, and the wishy-washy texture of my retreat begins to rankle.\n``Just how will I ruin your game, Ana?'' I demand. ``Some of your friends seem to want me in it.''\nA puzzled expression steals across her face. She looks at me more carefully, as if she were seeing me for the first time. ``Maybe you WOULD make a good Gordon Samatar,'' she says, but there is a note of disbelief in her voice. After a moment she turns to the others, her mind made up. ``Go to your horses, all of you,'' she commands, and they obey, running back to their rocks and mounting them in elaborate pantomime. So, she's going to let me play in their stupid game after all. Lucky me. See Jack play, see Ana scowl, see funny funny Sally. She turns back to me and points to the large boulder under the oak trees. ``That is Samatar's horse, the Black Stallion. The other horses fear him almost as much as we fear the Destroyer himself.''\n``It just looks like a big rock to me,'' I say, realizing too late that if I am going to continue this silliness I should really play along. ``Anyway, what are the rules of this game? What's so evil about this Gor-Don-the-Ter-Rib-Bull?'' I speak the villain's name in tones of exaggerated awe and dread. Get into the spirit of the thing, Jack.\nHer eyes narrow to tiny slits. ``I guess I was right about you the first time,'' she says. There is a long, uncomfortable pause, but Ana eventually decides that she is willing to tolerate my stupidity for the sake of having a villain in the game and avoiding another rebellion against her authority. ``If you PRETEND that it's a horse, it will BE a horse,'' she snaps, impatient at the need to point out the obvious to morons. ``There are no rules. Once you mount the Black Stallion you will know all you need to know---all your questions about Gordon Samatar will be answered.'' She turns away, moving with unquestionable dignity toward her ``horse,'' an orange and white block of sandstone. She mounts in one swift, fluid motion and raises her hand high in the air. ``Let the game begin!''\nI am sitting on a rock---a large black boulder with a natural saddle-like depression. It is still hot but the sun is noticeably lower in the sky and is no longer so fierce. This is a very boring game, so far. Ana had said my questions would be answered when I ``mount the Black Stallion,'' but to date not a whole lot has happened. Do I have to wait for Tinkerbell to come along and sprinkle pixie dust on me? Pretend, she had said, pretend. Well, that's something I haven't done for a very long time.\nFrom my slightly elevated position the kids look farther away than they really are. The shrill screams of their earlier play are gone; they speak in hushed whispers if they speak at all. I can now see that Ana's rock is at the head of a wedge-shaped formation pointing more or less toward this hill. They are all bouncing about on their rocks and have been for some time; from this I gather that the whole formation is supposed to be in motion. Perhaps I am being attacked. This goes on a while longer, a real action game. What am I DOING here? Wasn't I on my way to get another six-pack?\nMy head is feeling very heavy with the heat and the brew. More minutes pass and I look down at my watch to check the time. Sunlight reflects softly green-gold through the leaves on the burnished metal of my sword. Heads will roll at the touch of this blade before this day is done, I swear it. Ano`jas snorts his impatience and digs at the earth with his great hooves. I lean forward slightly in the saddle to quiet him.... and I clutch frantically at the rock's rough surface, fighting the sudden vertigo and disorientation. The coolness of the boulder reassures me; it is just a rock, solid, massive and immobile, not a prancing, wild-blooded stallion. But just for a moment there, a flicker of..., something. Ano`jas? The horse's name is Ano`jas. How do I know that?\nAna signals and the kids stop their ludicrous rock bouncing act. Across the distance I hear one of them call out softly, ``Whoa, boy!'' Lenora dismounts and calls to her lieutenant. There they confer long moments, examining the ground, scanning the low hills, testing the wind. From the mixture of colors among the horse soldier's garments I deduce that up to three separate villages have united under her in this foolish attempt to oppose me. Why do you hesitate, Lenora? What does that sixth sense of yours tell you I have up my sleeve? But she is no fool, this one they call Queen; she will not ride into my trap.\nI can see now that this little rebellion may not be as simple to stamp out as the others have been. Many of my own soldiers will die today before I have her head on the victory pole, but I care not how many---a thousand would be a small price to pay for the joy of watching that head shrivel in the sun. I draw my sword from its scabbard.... but again the ground leaps toward me and I tumble from my perch, the horrid image of Ana's dried up little prune face still before my eyes. The moment of dizziness passes, leaving me more confused than injured.\nIt's just a game, I tell myself, just a kid's game. But it all seems so real! By rights, I should be scared to death, but a tingle of excitement overrides the fear and I thrill to the vividness of what I've just experienced. Violent? Yes! Evil? You bet---Gordon ``the Terrible'' is definitely well-named. I should know, for I see into him, I am him. Sure, somebody's got to play the heavy, that doesn't bother me. What matters most is that I haven't felt this free in a long time, so close to finding something I thought I'd lost forever. Why haven't I noticed before the intensity of colors around me, the brilliant green of leaves against the deep blue sky, the dazzling white clouds.\nHow can this be happening, I wonder. But then, not really wanting or needing explanations, I climb back onto Ano`jas, eagerly anticipating the continuation of the game, the transformation of an inert and shapeless stone into a magnificent and powerful beast, so marvelously alive. I see Lenora and her soldiers advancing up the hill on foot, swords poised and ready. They are almost to the top now, the moment of truth is near. Lenora.... no, wait, it is Ana, it is just Ana...., and the flashing swords are merely branches in the hands of children. Come on, Jack, pretend! Suddenly, I become aware of a disturbance at my back and I turn, startled. It's Izzy and his friends, taking a shortcut through the lot back to the apartment building.\n``Hey, Jack, how ya doin', man?'' Izzy yells, waving as he passes. He thoughtfully cranks the volume of his stereo way up so that I can jive right along with him and his boys. Two of the kids break off from Ana's troop at his call to come home for dinner.\nAs the wake of Izzy's passing subsides, I become aware that my rear end hurts a great deal from sitting too long on the cold and unyielding stone. There is a momentary feeling of loss as I realize that the game is over. So soon? The rest of the kids begin to drift away, each to his or her own home and family situation, their own unique heaven or hell. The Peterson twins shout a friendly goodbye and I am surprised that there is no hint of rancor in their cheery faces, no accusation that I have ruined their game.\nIt is time for me to leave also, yet I feel a need to linger a few moments more, to look around one last time, as if to check that nothing important is left behind. Something does seem to be missing, though I can't put a name to it. Ana and Lu`is walk with me down the hill, along the shortcut back to the building. Broken beer bottles and crushed cigarette packages litter the rutted path and point the way, the crumbs of modern day Hansels and Gretls. Lu`is shows me the scar on his knee where five stitches had been needed to repair the damage from a fall among the bottles. ``Teresa Marguiles pushed me,'' he says, then adds proudly, ``and you shoulda seen the job Ana did on her!'' and I am glad for them that, despite their bickering, they are close to each other.\nThere is nothing of the earlier animosity in Ana's face as she and Lu`is wave goodbye and enter the building. If nothing else, there is now one less person in the world who hates me, and for me that's a significant accomplishment. But actually, there is more, lots more. For the briefest of moments there had been a tunnel, and through that tunnel I had glimpsed something of myself. Obvious, but never seen so clearly before, it is something that I think helps me to understand the anger. That's a strong dose of insight for one afternoon and it might take a long while for me to understand what it all really means.\nI sit down on the front steps, grateful for the dinner-time lull in the diurnal rhythm of life that now gives me a few moments for quiet reflection. A gentle breeze has kicked up and it feels good on my neck, cool and soft. Orange sunlight swirls in rainbow ribbons on the surface of a curbside puddle and I am aware of the beauty within its ugliness. ``It's just interference within the layers of oil floating on the surface,'' I might have said yesterday, neatly wrapping it up, cataloging my experiences to fit on the ordered shelves of my rational world. Tonight, I feel differently.\nInterference -- in-ter-fear-ence -- I roll the word over and over on my tongue like a mantra, until it becomes more than just a label. Like me, the sunlight is unable to pass through without joining the game---it has no choice but to interact with the world within and around it.\nSpeaking of interacting with the world, what I'd better do is get on down to the deli before it closes and pick up something for my own dinner. Now that it's cooled down a little, maybe I can get some work done on the dissertation.\nAltner received his PhD in physics last year (Rutgers University), and the story presented above was written in the early stages of his dissertation work. He is now an astrophysicist at Goddard Space Flight Center (Greenbelt, MD), working on projects involving the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the High Resolution Spectrograph (which is one of the six scientific instruments to fly on the Hubble Space Telescope, to be launched at the end of March, 1990). For relaxation he writes, draws silly cartoons (his favorite comic strip is Bill Waterson's \"Calvin and Hobbes\"), swims, and plays ice hockey and tennis.

All I knew was that I was lying naked on a firm mattress with light blue sheets. The walls of the bedroom were painted white, and the rug was a pleasant beige. Various pieces of furniture lay in strategic locations. There was no sound in the room; I couldn't even hear my own breathing.\nI pushed the sheets back, looked at myself, and frowned. This body needs a tan and a lot of exercise, I thought. Good thing it doesn't look familiar. But then, what would look familiar? After a moment, I realized that I didn't know.\nA bead of sweat trickled down the side of my forehead, and I cried out when it managed to find its way into my ear, causing my body to shiver and my hand to dart up and hastily try to rub the droplet out. I hate when that happens, I thought. I must make it a point not to sweat. Reaching up, I wiped my brow with the back of my hand.\nAfter taking a deep breath, I swung my legs out of bed and sat up, then surveyed the room again. There were some posters on the walls: Escher drawings, Dali prints, and a large photo of a sleek, black computer. I stared intently at each one, but nothing would come to mind about what they meant to me or even how they came to be on the walls. What does all of this mean? I thought. I didn't know.\nOn the nightstand was a white push button telephone. Maybe I can call someone, I thought, someone who can help me. But...who? I nervously ran a hand through my hair. I didn't know, and I wanted to scream.\nOn impulse, I reached out and snatched up the receiver, dialing 911 with my other hand.\nIt rang twice before someone answered.\n\"911,\" greeted someone. I couldn't tell if the person was a man or a woman.\n\"Hello,\" I said quickly. \"I...\" I didn't know what to say.\n\"Is something wrong?\" the voice asked seriously.\n\"I...\"\n\"Are you all right?\"\n\"I...I don't know. I think I'm all right.\" My mind did somersaults. \"I just woke up---\"\n\"And you don't know...?\" the voice finished for me.\n\"Yes. Yes, that's it exactly.\"\n\"So you called 911, first thing?\"\n\"Yes. I didn't know what else to do.\"\nSudden peals of laughter burst forth from the receiver, and I instinctively jerked it away from my ear.\n\"You don't know, and so you called 911!\" exclaimed the owner of the voice. Another laughing fit followed.\nI sat there on the edge of the bed, naked and frozen in horror. The laughter from the phone echoed menacingly about the bedroom, assaulting my ears from all directions. I had a death grip on the receiver, and I thought I could hear the plastic begin to crack. \"I don't understand why this is so funny!\" I yelled out.\nThe someone only laughed louder.\nAnd then, with a click, there was abrupt silence.\nI remained where I was, stunned, until the dial tone sounded, snapping me out of my fear-induced trance. I glanced around apprehensively, saw that I was still holding the receiver, and gingerly placed it back on the cradle. The laughter still reverberated within the walls of my mind.\nMaybe, I thought, maybe this is all a nightmare. Maybe I'll wake up, and everything will be normal again. I paused. Again? I thought. `What if this IS normal? What if I'm just out of my damned mind?!'\nI stared once more at the walls. Escher, Dali, and computer posters? Surely the mark of a lunatic, I concluded. Yes, the three-sided house with the people walking in different reference frames: that must represent my topsy-turvy world. The hands drawing themselves...Hmm, I'll have to think about that one. \"The Persistence of Memory\": a dash of irony, obviously. \"Burning Giraffes and Telephones\": a firm reminder of my insanity, no doubt. And the computer poster? Perhaps that has something to do with a job I had before I went nutso.\nI gazed at the phone and shuddered. But, I thought, that telephone conversation was definitely real. That person obviously knew something. But why didn't he\/she\/it help me? Maybe, I thought, maybe this is all a conspiracy, a huge plot to make me think I'm crazy!\nI frowned. No, I thought, that IDEA is just plain crazy.\nSo what do I do?\nI stretched out on the bed, rubbing my eyes and mulling over everything I knew.\nWell, I concluded, the first thing I can do is get dressed. Then I should get something to eat. And then...? Well, I'll burn that bridge when I get to it.\nDetermined, I stood up, rooted through the dresser and closet, and picked out some clothes. Then I searched for the bathroom, found it. Finally, I tracked down the kitchen and made myself a hearty breakfast of French toast, scrambled eggs, and a big cup of orange juice.\nIt hit me while I was swallowing a mouthful of French toast. All of the clothes in the closet, I realized, were of styles I liked, and the garments I picked out had fit me perfectly! Also, the kitchen is chock full of my favorite foods! Therefore, I concluded, this body must live in this house, and so must I. Hence, this body must indeed be mine. Q.E.D. Now I'm getting somewhere. But, I asked myself, to where am I getting? I forked up some eggs and chewed them thoughtfully. I didn't know.\nMy stomach finally full, I drained the last of the juice from my glass and thought, Now I'm ready. I leaned back in my chair and considered my options. I didn't have many. I could call 911 again, but that would probably result in further ridicule. I could call the operator, but how would that help me? I could sit around this house all day and hope I get better, but that would be boring. I could go outside, take a walk...Hmm, that idea seems pretty inviting, actually. The fresh air would do me good, and I might even run into someone who knows me. Yes, I think I'll go for a nice, long walk.\nI dropped the dirty dishes in the sink, headed for the front door, opened it, and stepped outside. It was a fine day for a walk: the sun was out, no clouds were to be seen, and birds were chirping merrily. Before I closed the door behind me, I made sure the keys I had found on the nightstand fit the locks. Then, my confidence growing, I firmly shut the door and locked it.\nI walked to the sidewalk and, on a whim, turned right and headed down the street. The other houses were not especially large, but they looked pleasant enough and had well-tended front lawns.\nNo one else was outside, but that was perfectly understandable; my digital watch claimed that it was Thursday, 10:30 a.m. So everyone should be at work or at school, I rationalized.\nI kept walking, breathing deep and appreciating the large oak trees that lined the street. Four blocks later I came to a park. I eagerly scanned the grassy area and saw several people. Some were sitting on benches, others were lying on the grass; some were reading books, others were merely soaking up the sun. I briskly walked towards the nearest of them, a blond young man wearing shorts and a t-shirt.\nAs I neared, he glanced up from his book, tilted his head, and smiled.\nI stopped in my tracks. Why is he smiling at me? I thought furiously. Does he know me? What should I do? Should I play along? Yes, that would probably be best.\nI smiled back.\nHe nodded approvingly and went back to his book.\nAha! Victory! I took a few more steps in his direction. \"Nice day, isn't it?\" I said conversationally. I could now see that he was reading a physics textbook. He's probably a college student, I surmised.\nHe looked back at me. \"Yes,\" he replied. He lifted up his textbook and added, \"I can never study indoors on a day like this. It seems like such a waste, you know?\"\n\"Ah, yes. Definitely.\" I then cleared my throat, glanced at the sky, and asked as nonchalantly as possible, \"Do you know me, by any chance?\"\nHe pursed his lips and then said, \"Sorry, no.\" He shrugged and returned to his textbook. Just before I was about to walk away and approach someone else, his eyes shot open and he jerked his head back up. \"No way!\" he called out jubilantly.\nAt the sound of his outburst, the other people in the park turned their attention towards us, and I cautiously stepped back.\n\"You don't know, do you?\" the college student asked incredulously.\n\"Uh, well...\" I said lamely.\n\"You don't know!\" he shouted gleefully. He jumped to his feet and pointed at me. \"You don't know!\"\nI grabbed my hair. \"What don't I know, damn it?! What!\"\nHe roared with laughter. All the other park patrons had rushed up and were now staring at me, pointing at me. \"You don't know!\" they yelled, laughing. \"You don't know!\"\n\"Why is this so funny?!\" I pleaded. \"Why won't you tell me?!\"\nMy words only served to fuel their laughter.\nHot tears ran down my cheeks, and I clutched myself. \"Why won't you tell me?\" I wailed.\n\"You don't know!\" they replied. Many of them were now crying, too, but for vastly different reasons. Several were even on the ground, they were laughing so hard.\nI turned and ran blindly because of the tears obscuring my vision. I cried out in agony several times.\nThe laughter quickly faded; they were too busy expressing their mirth to follow.\nI ran on regardless. Houses blurred past me, and I seemed to cover more and more ground with each stride. Soon, buildings sprang up and rushed by, blocking out most of the sky with their height.\nAnd I ran on regardless.\nMy mind was racing just as fast. That proves it! I thought. This whole nightmare has to be a conspiracy to drive me mad! Everyone's against me! But why, damn it? It doesn't make any sense. Perhaps that's the whole point: I wouldn't understand. Perhaps... Perhaps... My mind reeled as it suddenly hit a brick wall. I didn't know! I needed answers, damn it, ANSWERS!\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, I slowed down and collapsed from fatigue. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get any part of my body to move. Just as well, I thought. I closed my eyes and fell to sleep instantly.\nNightmares plagued my rest. The whole world was gathered around me, pointing and laughing. Nobody would tell my why, no matter how nicely I asked. Soon, the laughing became so loud and so out of control, that it hit the resonant frequency of the Earth, and the planet exploded, killing everyone except me. I floated in space, and the universe began laughing at me.\nI awoke with a scream and jumped to my feet, crouching and glancing around warily. My whole body was sore, but I could move if I didn't mind pain. I was in a dingy neighborhood; trash was piled on the sidewalk, and dreary tenement buildings reaching to infinity lined the street.\nA bag lady shuffled around the corner, stopping when she caught sight of me.\n\"Excuse me,\" I called out. \"Do you know?\"\nShe squinted at me. \"Yes,\" she responded in a raspy voice. \"Don't you?\"\n\"Oh, of course,\" I lied. \"Doesn't everybody?\"\nShe drummed her fingers on her leg and shambled closer to me. \"Sure,\" she said. \"Everyone knows. Isn't that right?\"\nPanic was starting to build up inside, but I stayed where I was. I can easily outrun her, I reasoned. \"Right. And it sure is funny what we all know, isn't it?\"\n\"Yup. Sure is.\" She came to within five feet of me, then stuck her neck out to peer more closely.\nA bead of sweat trickled down my nose, hung at the tip for a moment, then fell to the cement where it made a small, wet mark. I bit my lip, hoping that she hadn't seen that dead giveaway.\n\"Aha!\" she cried. \"I knew it! You don't know, do you?\" She cackled loudly and slapped her knee. \"You don't know!\"\nI was about to reach out and strangle her when I heard cacophonous screechings from above, as if God were scratching His fingernails on the sky.\nI looked up, and, to my horror, all the tenement windows were opening. The bag lady cackled even louder as all the residents in the buildings poked their heads out, spotted me, and began their ridicule.\n\"You don't know!\" they yelled. Their shouts rang out asynchronously and bounced around me, making me feel as if I were in a crazy echo chamber. Then the laughter crashed through, rolling up and down the buildings and sprinkled with continued exclamations of \"You don't know!\"\nThrough the mind-shattering din, it seemed to me that the walls of the buildings were starting to shake. My God! I thought, terrified. They've hit the resonant frequency!\nI forced myself to sprint down the street, even though my muscles protested vehemently. I must get far enough away, I thought frantically, or else I'll be buried by the rubble!\nI ran for several blocks and eventually came upon another park. I headed into it and collapsed at the base of a particularly sturdy-looking tree. It took me many minutes to regain my breath, but when I did, I rolled over and looked back down the street. The tenement buildings were still standing. And I could still hear their laughter, though it was fading fast.\nThe buildings didn't fall, I marvelled. What does this mean? I shook my head. I didn't know.\nExhaustion hit me like a ton of bricks. I laughed softly at the analogy and crawled off into some nearby bushes to sleep.\nSunlight shining in my eyes woke me from my pleasant slumber. I blinked and wondered, Why am I lying in a bed of shrubbery? Was I mugged? I thought in alarm. I sat up straight and looked around. The sun was low on the horizon, and it was uncommonly cold. I glanced at my watch, and it claimed that the time was 5:56 a.m. and that today was now Friday.\nIt was a new day, and...and I knew! Yes, I knew everything! I stood up and basked in the sunlight, thinking about the previous day's events. Soon I was chuckling, then guffawing, and finally I was rolling on the grass laughing uncontrollably.\nMany minutes later, I sat up, rubbing the tears from my face and giggling weakly. I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and turned my head. The bag lady was tramping slowly towards me, a smile on her old and wrinkled face.\nI smiled back and called out, \"I know.\"\nShe nodded her head and sat down a few feet from me. \"Wonderful, wasn't it?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Definitely.\"\n\"Many years ago, when I was young---younger than you, even---I also had the good fortune to not know. I'll never forget that day.\"\nI nodded. \"Yes, I'll treasure mine for the rest of my life.\"\nThe bag lady squinted at the rising sun. \"Do you think,\" she asked after a long moment, \"that I'll ever not know again?\"\nI thought over her question for a time and finally replied, \"I don't know.\"\nRobert Hurvitz is a computer science major at UC Berkeley who would rather be a writer, but doesn't want to starve. \"The Big Joke\" came to be from listening to too much Oingo Boingo and from too little sleep.

He heard Starkadder's voice a few steps behind and to his left.\n``Keep going,'' it said. ``Chereny has one of the overseers watching you. He still thinks you were the one who tried to strangle him last week. He doesn't believe Roge's confession.''\nWhen Justin had programmed Starkadder's voice, he'd decided that if it seemed to come from behind, it wouldn't seem so disembodied and spooky. He hadn't thought that he would have an automatic urge to turn around and look for the source of the voice---he knew it was in his mind---but most times he barely stopped himself in time. When he didn't, he pretended to be knocking a bug off his back; still, it might look odd to someone watching. And now there was someone watching all the time.\nHe bent to plant another handful of seeds. This time of year the soil was moist and newly turned; it gave off a scent that embodied everything good about Nele, the land he'd lived in all his life---the land which was the greatest in a world he now knew was only a primitive planet, far away from the mainstream of the developed stars.\nJustin was glad he'd met the Chesetians---after all, they had given him Starkadder---but he wasn't sure he could ever be happy again. Being happy meant knowing his place in the world; now he wasn't sure if his place _was_ in the world. He kept thinking he belonged somewhere that wouldn't condemn him for Starkadder, or any of the other improvements he'd made in his brain with the Chesetian equipment. The strict laws of Nele would execute a man for practicing psychotherapy; what would they make of a neural programmer?\nAt the end of the row, he ran out of seed. Justin walked over to the seed barrel and, holding his sack below the opening, carefully pulled out the cork. A golden stream of seed began slowly to fill the sack.\nWhen it was about half-full, a girl whose own sack was empty came up behind Justin to wait her turn at the seed barrel. Careful not to spill, Justin turned to speak to her. It was odd that he did not recognize her, since he knew all the plantation people. Starkadder did not comment.\n``Hello,'' he said, not knowing how to address her. ``I'm Justin, Nal. I am a thousandth planter of this plantation.'' He waited for her answer.\n``Hello, Justin. You may call me Deesay, here. I am here for planting, to help. Lord Chereny has made a call, not having enough planters to put seed down on his entire plantation before the end of the season.'' She moved closer to him. In his ear, she whispered, ``There is more. Meet me after dinner in the transient cabin at Thousan'town---act like you're picking me up. I was told to say: my regards to Starkadder.''\nJustin's sack was full, more than he would usually have allowed. It was very heavy. He recorked the barrel and allowed Deesay (if that was her name) to move next to the seed.\nIn the field Justin's mind was working furiously, but he came up with no more than he had in the instant the girl spoke her private message: she was from the Chesetians, or she knew all about them; and she had some way of suppressing the satellite scans, or Starkadder, or both. If Starkadder had known who she was, it would have told him. And if the satellites had been able to track her, as they tracked everyone on Nele, Starkadder should have known. It hadn't even warned him that someone was coming up behind him.\nStarkadder had apparently not been permanently suppressed, because its voice now spoke, still seeming to come from several steps behind Justin. ``An overseer is approaching, not the one who has been assigned to watch you. Tenth Aza Chereny wants to see you.'' Aza! Justin hadn't spoken personally to him in three years. First a picture of Aza as a boy, helping Justin up as the two of them climbed a trie, replaced by a memory of a red-faced newly adult Aza calling insults, in turn replaced by a more mature, calm man (seen from a distance) who had in him little of the boy.\nThe overseer was windblown and weatherbeaten; his class spent all day outdoors guarding the plantation from thieves and small planters. ``Thousandth Justin? Tenth Aza requires you in the manor,'' said the man, with a pronounced Westernele accent.\nJustin replied, ``When does he want me? I have seventeen more rows to plant. One or two of those is Aza's. He may have to be patient.''\n``He requires you instantly. I must take you forcibly if you refuse.'' The overseer, like many who did not speak Southernele from the cradle, reverted to formality at times of stress.\n``All right. If Aza requires me, it must be important.'' Carrying his sack of seed, Justin followed the Western overseer out of the fields. They walked into the roomy entrance hall of the manor. The cool air felt clammy to Justin, who was used to the hot sun and the stuffy interiors of Thousan'town cabins. The overseer went to tell Aza that Justin had arrived. A maid wandered through, dusting the tables and cabinets in the hall.\n``Could I have a shirt or something? It's chilly in here,'' Justin asked the maid.\n``I'll see if I can get you something,'' the maid said. She was amused by his discomfort: he was now shivering a little, the bare flesh of shoulders and arms covered in goosepimples.\nShe went out and returned moments later, with a light jacket. The sleeves were a little long for Justin, and the jacket wouldn't fasten around his chest, but he was warmer. He rolled up one sleeve to a comfortable length. As he started on the second one, Aza came in.\nHe looked much older than Justin knew he was: Aza was losing his hair. The newly high forehead made him look wiser, and even sophisticated. But his thoughtful look and second-long, gone-before-you-really-saw-it smile were left over from Aza's childhood and completely familiar to Justin.\n``I apologize for bringing you here without notice,'' said Aza. ``But it was necessary.'' He led Justin through the manor to his private study, called the _Green Palace_ by the manor staff. Aza had a knack for growing exotic plants. ``The man who tried to assasinate my father has confessed that he had an accomplice. You are suspected.''\n``Roge said he had an accomplice? I don't believe it,'' Justin said.\n``Yes, Roge. That is the man's name. Well, I don't believe it either; at least, I don't believe the wretched man had an accomplice. But Lord Chereny does, and the questioner has been ... encouraging him to say you were involved in the attempt. My father is convinced, for some reason, that you were the one who tried to strangle him. He will accept no other theory.'' Aza began to pace. He stopped, fingering the dangling leaf of a golden-green plant hanging overhead. ``Do you know why he would be so convinced of this? Do you have any information?''\nHe looked dismayed when Justin shook his head. ``If you do not, I will be forced to put you in prison to await trial. I will have no other course to follow. But I don't want to incarcerate you. I don't think you are guilty, and I ... I feel some friendship towards you.''\n``The only thing I can tell you is that I would doubt Roge's original confession as much as the accomplice bit. I don't think he is capable of plotting a murder or cooperating in one. The man isn't a doer,'' Justin said.\nAza told him, ``I would have agreed, but why would he confess if he hadn't done it? It would be insane.''\n``Maybe he has gone insane,'' said Justin. ``Of course, in that case, he could have murdered, too, I suppose.''\n``And I can't release him unless I have proof that he's innocent and just harmlessly crazy,'' Aza said. ``Even if I do get such proof, you become our first suspect. You have to know more than that.''\n``I don't,'' Justin protested. ``If I knew who did it ...''\n``You're lying,'' Aza said. ``You're protecting another Thousandth, or a servant, or an overseer, someone you think was justified to try to kill my father. Maybe he hasn't been completely honest with everyone on the plantation, but murder goes a little beyond fair redress, doesn't it?''\nJustin was silent.\n``He does have some real reason to suspect you, you know. You did say he deserved to be punished for cheating on the distribution two years ago. He's been afraid of you since then, not just this past week,'' Aza said accusingly.\n``I said he should try to live in a cabin in Thousan'town for the summer with a limited ration of fresh water. I said that would be proper punishment for him. That doesn't make me a murderer---unless he is.'' Justin was getting angry, a little unfairly. He did have a good idea who had tried to kill Lord Chereny, just as Aza thought. But he was not refusing to tell because he was trying to protect the criminal. He simply could not explain how he knew without revealing damning evidence against himself, and even giving Aza the information without a source would reveal that he knew more than any Thousandth planter ever should.\nAza asked, ``Just tell me something ... so I can say you've cooperated. Give me a hint, come on.'' His voice grew sharper. ``And stop sounding so bitter! You're exaggerating, and if you keep acting that way, you'll make him worse. Then I won't be able to help you.''\n``Do you really feel that friendly toward me?'' Justin asked with sincere curiousity. ``I wouldn't have thought so, even an hour ago.''\nAza looked startled. ``Why not? We were good friends, as boys. I think I spent more time with you than with my family. We haven't been ... recently, but ...'' he trailed off. ``Why not?'' he repeated.\n``Don't you remember how you, well, warned me right before you went North three years ago? You yelled at me to stay in Thousan'town where I belonged, not to mix with advanced folk such as yourself, not to presume; by the time you got back I was presuming quite a bit, investigating your father's practice of stealing from the poor and selling to the rich. I supposed you would never want to speak to me again; I certainly didn't care to speak to you.'' Justin paused, breathing audibly, almost a sigh. ``All right. I can tell you one thing. After this, please leave me alone---you don't want your father thinking you are plotting against him with me. This is it, all right? I don't think it was anyone on this plantation who tried to kill him. And I don't think he will ever be able to put the criminal in prison, even if he finds out who it was. Now I have to go. I have seventeen more rows to plant today.'' Justin stood up.\nAza stood too. ``Let me show you out,'' he said politely. At the door to the manor, he stopped. ``Good-bye, Justin,'' he said.\n``Good-bye.'' Justin picked up his seed sack and his walked back toward his seventeen rows. He imagined the conversation which might have occurred if he had told his thoughts to Aza.\n``I believe the instigators of the murder attempt are people from another planet,'' Justin says.\n``Another _what_?'' Aza almost yells. ``You mean another plantation, don't you?''\n``Another planet, I said,'' Justin insisted.\n``What makes you think there even is such a thing?''\nAt this point the imaginary conversation breaks down. Justin would not be able to tell Aza about the Chesetians, and he could think of no other possible explanation for his theory. Of course, he could say he had heard rumors, but Aza would question his sanity for believing that kind of rumor with no evidence. It sounded like wish-fulfillment, since the plantation people were desperate to be exonerated.\nHe finished planting around the time Thousan'town would be settling down to supper---those who had it. He went into his own cabin, where he'd lived alone since his mother died, and put a half-full pot on the fire, soon to be a quick meal of boiled grains and vegetables.\nHe took out the past week's Journal to read while the food cooked. It had only arrived two days earlier; the Chereny plantation was so far from Casternor, the city in which the Journal was published, that Justin's copy always came about ten days late. The Journal was somewhere between a weekly newspaper and a nonfiction anthology; the writers were given scope to express their opinions without any attempt at objectivity, but an effort was made to describe the important events of the week in Nele. The quality varied sharply between various writers, some of whom wrote regularly and others only once or twice. Justin himself had had an article published in the Journal, but under an assumed name. He had called himself Ches Nal Black, in honor of the Chesetians, his assumed lineage name Nal, and his mother's true lineage name, Black. Since Justin had never known his father's lineage, he had adopted the Nal lineage. The Nal had, as far as Justin knew, died out about a hundred years earlier, leaving only traces of their history. Only one of the Nal had ever achieved any lasting fame, but that one was Armeny s-Nal, the pioneer popularizer of the share system which now governed most of the plantations of Nele. Armeny based his system on traditional ones used long before in very limited context, but expanded them into a system so flexible and adaptable it could be suited to feudal- or commune-organized plantations equally well.\nAfter eating his supper, Justin decided to follow Deesay's instructions. He was too curious to pass up a chance to solve the puzzle she had created, and felt too threatened by her knowledge to let her continue to pretend she was an ordinary transient.\nHe walked over to the transients' cabin. It was a large, wooden building, capable of housing fifty men and women in need. Twenty or so transients lived there, fairly comfortably, at most times. During harvest, the building would hold over eighty, sleeping in rotation. As Justin approached, he saw Deesay standing outside, looking at rocks she picked up off the paths.\nHe stepped up beside her, looking at the black and grey stone she held. ``What's so interesting about that rock?'' he asked.\nDeesay looked up. ``Oh, hello. It's not this pebble that's interesting, it's where I found it. This kind of rock is rare on the surface in the South. In this region, it would have to be imported, or taken from a deep excavation, or maybe thrown up in an earthquake.''\n``How do you know that?'' Justin asked, surprised.\n``I know lots of things ...'' Deesay said. ``I've been studying this place, before I came. Listen, do you have a place here where we can talk privately?'' She said this with artifical flirtatiousness, then lowered her voice. ``We have to talk. Thank you for coming over, you did very well.''\nHe began to walk toward his cabin. Deesay followed. Justin said, ``You didn't do too well. People here don't know that kind of thing, especially transients.''\nDeesay looked puzzled. ``Don't you get traveling students working in the fields here? I thought that was common. Supporting themselves as they study the culture, geology, whatever?''\n``I don't know,'' said Justin. ``It sounds reasonable, I guess, but I never met anyone like that. We don't have students here as transients much, I suppose, or they pretend not to be---to study the culture better, maybe.''\nThey arrived at his cabin. Justin opened the door and they walked in.\n``I like your furnishings,'' Deesay said.\n``No, you don't,'' said Justin. ``I know what you're used to, wherever you came from. What have you come here for? Why were you told to say---what you said to me.''\n`` `My regards to Starkadder'? When I told a friend I was coming here to study Nele, he told me he knew a man who was a natural genius at neural programming, who was living on the Chereny plantation in South Nele. I'd been learning Easternele, but once you've got that one Southernele isn't so hard. He asked me to try to persuade you to leave here, and go work for his company. But I don't think---'' Justin interrupted. ``What company was he talking about?''\n``Chesea Neurnetyx Realcompagne, of course.'' She took a card out of a\nconcealed pocket.\n| ________ | | |\n| XYrr-2522 tty00028 |\n|_________________________|\nJustin had never heard this name. But the visitors he called Chesetians had said they were ``from Chesea,'' and he had only assumed they meant their nation.\n``If they wanted me to come work for them, why didn't they ask me before?'' Justin asked.\n``How should I know?'' asked Deesay. ``But according to Whitey, your talent is wasted here. The anti-psychorifling laws prevent any sort of industry getting started in Nele. There aren't enough natural resources anywhere else on the planet.''\nThe implications of this statement hit Justin with the force of ten gravities. He had thought Nele was the only place on the planet. Or really, he had not thought about the possibility of other nations.\n``Where else on the planet could they go?'' Justin asked.\n``Nowhere, I just said there weren't enough natural resources.'' Deesay asked, ``Well? Are you considering leaving with me? Would you like to be a professional?''\nJustin thought about this. It would solve all his problems: no more chance of arrest for Lord Chereny's attempted murder; no more need to conceal Starkadder; no more unfair distribution practices to risk his freedom protesting. His mother was dead, there was no one he would be leaving behind.\n``In a way I can't stay in Nele. A man I had forgotten was my friend, Aza Chereny, just warned me I may soon be arrested,'' Justin said.\n``What? For what crime?'' protested Deesay.\n``Someone tried to strangle his father, Lord Chereny, who thinks I'm behind everything. Aza wanted me to give him some information, so he could say I was helping with the investigation, but I don't know who did it.''\n``Aza sounds like he's really caught between you and his father,'' Deesay said.\n``Well, I don't know. But if I am going to join Chesea, I don't understand how it works. How would I be allowed to leave Nele?'' asked Justin.\n``Simple,'' said Deesay. ``When the _Frame_ comes to take me back, I'll bring you along.''\n``Don't I need a passport, or identification? The Chesetians had those rainbow coins they said were their equivalent. I thought they didn't think of taking me with them because they couldn't make me one of those.''\n``Absolutely right,'' Deesay said. ``But they will have to take you, and we will get one of those made for you right away, at the first bordermark we reach.''\nJustin was puzzled. ``Why will they have to take me? That doesn't make sense.''\nShe brought a folded paper out of the pocket which had also held the card. ``This,'' she said.\nIt was ornately decorated and written in a language he did not know.\n``What is it?'' Justin asked.\n``Well ... it's a unification agreement,'' Deesay said. ``It's something like a marriage or adoption contract, binding people together into a legal family.''\n``I'm going to marry you? Or adopt you? Or maybe you'll adopt me,'' Justin laughed.\n``I said something like,'' said Deesay. ``Ah ... there's something else. I have to put my real name on it, so you might as well know what that is. Devise Zar-Leroi. But don't say it in public, or when you aren't near me.''\n``Devise?'' Justin asked. ``That's a strange name.''\n``It means `invent.' It's better than Deesay: Deesay means `she says.' I'm more inventive than I am talkative,'' Devise told him.\n``When you tell me not to mention you when you're not around, you mean that gadget that keeps the satellites from seeing you, don't you. If they hear me talking about you, someone might notice you're invisible,'' Justin said.\n``How do you know about that?'' Devise demanded.\nJustin explained, ``Starkadder didn't tell me you were coming up behind me. He announces everyone I don't know or can't see. You fit both categories, but he didn't say a word. I thought you might be suppressing him, but you weren't; he just didn't see you, because the satellites didn't.''\n``That's some program,'' said Devise. ``No wonder Whitey says you're a genius.'' She brought the paper to Justin's attention again. ``You can just sign this,'' she said. ``It's sufficient even if you don't fully understand the agreement's terms. If I've cheated you, you can sue me for recompense, but I promise it's all right by our standards.''\nJustin had only the vaguest idea what her standards might be like, but he signed anyway. He was so sure now that he wanted to go, he would sign anything to insure it.\n``Don't change your behavior, act as though nothing has changed. The _Frame_ is going to show up some time between tomorrow morning and next week. I'll come over and get you: have everything you want to take assembled and wrapped to carry. We'll have to leave right away, when they come.'' Devise left Justin's house.\nJustin slept uneasily. He had made the right decision, he thought, but his life would never again be what he considered normal. He hoped that wouldn't translate into unhappy.\nA commotion outside his door woke him the next morning. He could see nothing of its cause through his single, narrow window. Justin stood and put on work clothes.\nAs he finished dressing, his door was thrust open. The commotion grew louder, and now Justin could see that half Thousan'town was standing in his yard. Three overseers had taken the hinges off his door to get it open. Near the edge of the road, Justin saw Devise in the crowd.\nAn overseer said, ``I arrest you, Justin, called Nal, left of Black, to answer the charges of attempted murder and conspiracy against Lord Chereny. Your property is now in the wardship of justice, and forfeit if you are guilty. Come with me now.''\nAs the man spoke, Justin saw Devise moving away, toward the transients' area.\nStarkadder spoke at his back, like a murmur in his ear. ``Roge has finally been forced to name you as his co-conspirator. You will be imprisoned if you don't leave the area ... The overseer Lord Chereny sent to arrest you is arriving now ...'' Justin was frightened. Apparently, whatever it was that Devise used to block the satellites and Starkadder was ruining Starkadder's ability to function. Normally it should have warned him of the danger in plenty of time to escape.\nDevise was frightened too. She sent a neuromessage to Chesea Recruitment officer Sofya Valadiya on _Frame_. The message was somewhat incoherent, but a translation would be something like: ``The solution has caused more problems. To remove recruit from habitat, cause trauma in habitat; but trouble captured recruit and made removal unlikely.''\n``What happened? Be calm,'' was Valadiya's reply.\n``Two causes: attempt on life of Chereny Senior; interruption of data to keep my presence unknown. Result: recruit wants to leave, but is imprisoned and unable.'' Devise sends urgency across neuromessage circuit.\n``Calm. Rational. Tranquil. Now, send me a causal chain.'' Valadiya was used to dealing with field agents under stress; when weren't they having an emergency?\n``Chesea personnel arranged for recruit to be unwanted in Nele. They arranged he would be suspected of a crime. I arrived. To keep my arrival secret, I blocked satellite scan. The same blocking transmission interfered with operation of recruit's neuroprogram. Therefore he was not as well informed as usual. He was just arrested for the crime Chesea arranged. Now how can I get him to the _Frame_?''\nDevise was ordering her thoughts more clearly under the direct influence of the neuromessage circuit.\nValadiya told her, ``You have to get him out of prison.''\n``How?'' asked Devise.\n``That's your job. You're the agent.''\n``How much exposure can I allow myself?'' she asked.\n``As little as possible\/Whatever it takes,'' came an answer loaded with ambivalence.\nDevise said, ``I won't be able to do it. I claim revocation, take me home.''\n``You can't do that,'' Valadiya told her.\n``Why not?'' Devise protested.\n``You signed that unification agreement, didn't you?'' asked the recruitment officer.\nDevise said, ``Oh. You ... make such plans. I have to get him out of prison, legally, don't I? Because I signed that unification agreement that was just supposed to let him off Nele. Now I know why you're in charge of half of Recruitment.'' She paused, planning her next transmission carefully. It was an untranslatable joke. Unification agreements were taken seriously, but their many entanglements made them the subjects of every kind of humor.\nJustin was taken into the basement of the manor, where prisoners were kept. There were six cells, each of which could hold four men. Only two cells were tenanted. One held three men, the other only one: Roge.\nRoge was in bad shape. He looked like a man who had been forced to give false evidence against his will, Justin thought, which supported what Starkadder had told him.\nThe overseer pushed Justin into a cell across from Roge's. The three men in the cell furthest from Roge were all in their beds, but one raised his head.\n``What's going on?'' he asked.\nThe overseer said, ``We've got the man Lord Chereny wanted.''\n``Justin Black,'' said the man. ``I lose again. Gerd!'' he said loudly, turning toward the man beside him. ``Gerd! Wake up! You win, I'm only four up on you now.''\nThe other prisoner sat up. He was wearing what Justin assumed was a prison suit, an unusually dirty gray one-piece garment. ``Well, I thought you'd be in here. Roge is wrong about everything.''\nThe overseer was locking Justin into his cell. ``Shut your mouths, all of you,'' he said, leaving them alone.\nRoge looked over at Justin. ``Sorry,'' he said hoarsely.\n``Did you do it?'' Justin asked. ``I told Aza I didn't think you had tried to kill his father, but I'm not sure he believed me.''\n``Why would I confess to it, if I hadn't done it?'' Roge asked.\n``Why would you confess if you had?'' Justin countered.\n``Guilt, maybe,'' suggested Roge.\n``I suppose. I just can't see you as the kind of man ... '' Justin trailed off.\nRoge said, ``I can't see myself as that kind of person either. I just don't even know why I tried to strangle him. I don't even know why I confessed to it. I don't understand anything.''\nJustin did not know what to say to answer him. The other prisoners went back to sleep, now that there was nothing going on.\nSoon Justin, with nothing else to do, went to sleep too.\nThe rescue turned out not to be so difficult. Devise had not realized that the ``prison'' Justin was being taken to was only Lord Chereny's residence. She remembered that Aza Chereny had tried to help Justin, and knew he would be her key into the manor.\nShe changed her clothing. Devise was now the model of a Lord's daughter from one of the wealthier Easternele plantations.\n``Hello,'' she said to the maid at the door. ``I've come to visit Aza.'' The maid welcomed her in. Devise was led to the plant-filled study, where Aza was working on a boxed row of spiky flowers. ``Aza Chereny,'' she said. ``I've been told so much about you.'' The maid left. As soon as she had, Devise stepped over to Aza. ``Listen. I know you've arrested Justin,'' she began.\nAza said, ``What do you---''\nShe continued, ignoring his attempt to interrupt. ``You don't want him in prison, but you can't let him stay free here, right? Well, I'm going to take him off your hands. You'll never see him again, but he'll be free, and happier than he could be here. All you have to do is let me have him.''\nAza wanted to believe her, but didn't understand her at all. ``I really don't know what you're talking about.''\n``I'm just going to smuggle him out of here. No one in Nele will ever see him again. No one but you will know how he escaped.'' Devise waited. There wasn't much time; the _Frame_ would touch down in less than an hour.\nDoubting his own sanity, Aza took her down a back staircase into the basement. He unlocked all the cell doors, as she directed. Then he took her on a tour of the manor. He noticed her sprinkling a pale yellow powder on the floors, everywhere they went.\nThe yellow powder all over the manor was a neuroerase formula Devise carried for use in emergencies. The overseers and servants woke the next day with only traces of memory, unable to explain how their wards had vanished. The former prisoners woke in the fields, unable to say how they had escaped.\nJustin woke in his room on the _Frame_, knowing only that he was no longer a prisoner of Lord Chereny ... and no longer a prisoner of Nele.\nDana Goldblatt never has admitted to preferring science fiction over other forms of fiction, except when it was cheaper at used bookstores.

We hadn't seen each other in a while, since we went to colleges on opposite coasts, (I was at Boston College, Leach at U. Oregon) and we hadn't even had a proper phone call all term, so we split a cab fare downtown, and went for doughnuts at a homey little diner on Carson St. We'd found the place a few years back, when I bought my first car -- a '76 Plymouth Fury wagon: What a beast! We christened her \"Gert the Rap Car\" for the way the oil light flicked on and off to the rhythm of the stereo I'd bribed my older brother into installing for me. Anyway, we liked the atmosphere of the place: Gerri, the owner, was a little old woman with a pipe who told dirty jokes to the ever-present policemen, and always greeted us when we came in (\"Hey! It's Greg and Leach! What can I get my boys today?\"); there was a television in the corner which somehow managed constantly to show \"All in the Family\" re-runs; and the doughnuts were home-made (\"All natural ingredients!\") so that you could feel the cholesterol congealing there in your stomach for three days after eating one. But the taste -- the taste made it all worthwhile.\nI guess Gerri was sick the day Leach and I flew into town, because there was a younger woman waiting on the cops in the diner. She looked familiar; I thought she might be Gerri's granddaughter -- about five feet seven, a little overweight, she had Gerri's strong shoulders. We might have gone to high school together, but I wasn't sure. I've been avoiding my high school class for a while, and don't always recognize them.\nLeach and I had been sitting in the diner for a while, and were still waiting patiently for service. Well -- I was waiting patiently: Leach was whistling show-tunes in an attempt to get the waitress' attention. She was busily smoking Gerri's pipe with a red-haired police officer at a table across the diner from Leach and me. Since we were accustomed to quick and cheerful service from Gerri, we were kind of annoyed, not to mention hungry -- the airline food hadn't been much use (how many peanuts can one person eat?). And I couldn't figure out why we hadn't been served yet -- it's tough to think straight to the tune of \"I Get No Kick From Champagne.\"\n\"So Leach,\" I said, hoping that he might start talking, and, therefore, have to stop whistling, \"How long do you suppose we've been in here?\" I immediately regretted asking.\n\"Oh,\" he responded, loudly and in the waitress' direction, \"Can't have been more than an hour or two, yet. I expect SUSAN, OUR WAITRESS, will be along in a couple days. What are you going to get, since you've had SO LONG to decide? I'm going to go with a chocolate glazed and a cup of black coffee, I think.\" Then he started to sing lyrics from `Pajama Game'.\nWhen you're racing with the clock, When you're racing with the clock *1*\nI don't know where Leach picked up his interest in musical theatre; his parents owned a few dozen chickens, and sold eggs to the local grocery store, and they didn't care for \"THAT sort of social function.\" As far as I know, he'd never auditioned for a show, let alone been in one. He was never involved with the drama kids in high school, anyway, and he didn't strike me as the type who went in for acting. It looked like it might be time I re-evaluated my opinion of his dramatic ability and interest.\nI think our waitress (Susan, apparently, although her nametag said \"Hello My Name is Gerri.\") was in a couple high school musicals, now that I think of it. I've always thought it would be fun to be in a show, but all the best parts are for women, and our school was too prim to let me act in drag. I haven't had time, since, what with classes all year.\nI looked across the diner at Susan, and saw her busily smoking Gerri's pipe, just as she'd been doing for some twenty minutes, then looked back to Leach. I decided that there was no point in asking him to be patient: we'd had that discussion more than once in the past, and he was strong in his belief that, if a chicken can reliably produce an egg, then so should a diner. We'd abandoned more than one otherwise acceptable restaurant because their food or service was less than Leach was willing to accept. \"If I have to pay for it, then I should get what I want when I want it,\" he'd always say; so I just pretended he hadn't been shouting across the room. I tried not to notice that the waitress was carefully ignoring us.\nI listened to Leach whistling for a few minutes, then he began humming instead, and finally just stopped. He looked over at Susan, and back. \"Hmm,\" he said, tentatively, \"Say Greg, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.\"\n\"Oh?\" This sounded promising: at least he wasn't whistling.\n\"How do you feel about eggs?\"\n\"Huh? Actually, eggs sound pretty good. I haven't had breakfast yet, and I wasn't really in the mood for doughnuts anyhow. I think I'll have a couple fried eggs, and maybe a slice of hot apple pie.\"\n\"Fried eggs?\" he said. He looked upset. \"You're going to eat fried eggs? In front of me? So soon after the accident? Oh Greg,\" here he paused dramatically, and hung his head, \"You disappoint me. I should think that after all these years you'd respect my feelings enough not to eat eggs like that, right in front of me -- I mean, out in the open like that. Are you trying deliberately to upset me? After what's happened to my parents--\"\n\"What's happened to your parents?\" I had no idea what he was talking about at that point; even now, I find it difficult to accept.\n\"What do you mean, `What's happened?'\" he said, his face beginning to flush, \"You know what's happened to my parents.\"\nNothing had happened to his parents as far as I knew, and considering their lifestyle, I couldn't imagine what could. His father claimed to be a virgin, and his mom's most dangerous activity was getting the mail at the end of her driveway. \"What about your parents? I really have no idea what you're talking about. I phoned your mom yesterday to find out when you're flight was getting into town, and she was fine. She said your dad was okay, too, when I asked how things were going. Did something happen to them last night?\" I have to admit, I was really concerned now. I'd known his parents for something like twelve years -- as long as I'd known Leach -- and they were the nicest people I ever met, even if they were a little strange. Sure, they named their son \"Leach,\" but he was named after his great-uncle, the war hero....\n\"The incu -- the --\" Leach choked up a bit, but finally managed to say, \"The incubator blew up on them, and they were -- Oh Greg, they were killed by the shrapnel -- I thought you knew....\"\n\"Are you KIDDING?\" This was a pretty disgusting joke, if he was. He looked at me, shaking from tense shock that I might doubt him, especially on something like this. But before he could answer, our prodigal waitress, whose friend on the force had finally gone off to disturb some copulating teenagers in station wagons, decided that Leach and I had come to a sufficiently awkward point in our discussion that interrupting us would be worthwhile. \"Hello!\" she chirped around Gerri's pipe, just as though we'd only that moment arrived, \"What can I get you gentlemen?\"\nI just wanted her to go away, so, before Leach could begin telling her the tragic story of his parents and their demon incubator, or how dare they serve eggs on a day like today, I said, \"Hot apple pie, please, and do you have fresh cider today?\"\nIt was no good, though. Before Susan could write down my order on her little green pad, Leach said cheerfully, \"Well, gosh! I think I'd like to start with the two hours I've wasted waiting for service, and then, how about a glass of milk? I assume you aren't serving milk today?\"\n\"Leach,\" I said, trying to calm Leach so we could order and get on with the discussion, \"It's only been about half an hour.\"\nNo use. Susan just turned around and went back to where she'd been sitting. At least, I thought, she was gone. I turned my attention to my friend, about to ask what the hell he was talking about. He was furious, judging by his expression, and he stood and went to her table.\n\"Hello!\" he chirped. It was a pretty good impression of her. Then he grabbed her pipe. Gerri's pipe.\n\"Uh, Leach --\" I was going to point out exactly whose pipe it was, but he interrupted me.\n\"What can I get you today, you lazy cow?\" he said, and stuck the pipe bowl-first into her coffee cup, which steamed obligingly. He gestured for me to join him as he stormed out of the diner.\nOutside, Leach was pounding on the building, and chips and fragments of the decaying brick-face were skittering around the sidewalk. I thought I'd better distract him before he did any more serious damage -- say, to the building itself. \"What was that about your parents? The incubator blew up?\" I knew how tactless I sounded, but I just couldn't take him seriously. It was too weird. \"They were fine when I called yesterday.\"\nLeach spun to face me, then deflated. He nodded, all his anger gone with his energy. \"I thought you knew. It was all over the papers last week.\"\nThat was when I got really skeptical. \"If it happened this morning,\" I said carefully, \"How could it have been in the paper last week?\"\n\"It was in their horoscope.\"\n\"What? Leach --\" I couldn't believe he was telling me this. What was he trying to pull, anyhow?\n\"It was in their horoscope,\" he repeated. \"See?\"\nAries: The gentleman in the red convertible wants you.\nTaurus: You will score 278 and spare the last frame.\nCancer: Duck!\nScorpio: Watch out for incubators today. Yours is going to blow up.\n\"They were born on the same day, you know.\" He sniffed. \"It was supposed to mean -- it was supposed to mean they'd be LUCKY together.\" he choked on lucky.\nI had known about his parents' birthday, but it hadn't seemed relevant to the discussion. They'd been at a CYO meeting, or one of those weird Moose Lodge political rallies, or something -- it changed with every telling -- and the speaker said, \"Hey everyone, we have two birthdays today!\" in that embarrassing forward way that only masters of ceremonies and lounge singers are taught. \"June Roths and Troy McBugnuts are both twenty-five today!\" It was all very embarrassing to them both, so they say. But judging by the frequency with which they tell the story, I doubt they were too devastated by the incident.\n\"Uh, Leach\"\n\"Yeah?\" He looked up hopefully, as though the thought I might say 'everything is going to be fine.'\n\"When did you see this?\"\n\"Last thursday. It was in the Tribune. Or do you mean the actual accident?\" I nodded that this was, in fact, what I meant. \"I haven't actually SEEN the accident yet, Greg. How could I? I haven't been home, and it only happened this morning. I've been with you as long as I've been in town. We met at the airport, remember?\" he said it as though he were afraid for my sanity, but I wasn't about to be distracted.\n\"So you haven't actually seen this mess yet?\"\n\"No! I just told you it happened this morning. I was on a plane from Oregon. Really, you're beginning to worry me Greg.\"\nI ignored the last bit, and said, patiently, \"Let's see what's in the Tribune this morning and then check out the incubator at your house, okay?\"\nHe mumbled something about choosing less morbid friends in the next life, but I insisted. Wouldn't there be something in the paper if there were a local disaster? So we bought a paper from one of the glass dispenser things on the side of Carson St. and headed for the bus stop in front of the magic store. Rumor has it that the owner was possessed by the spirit of his dead grandfather, until he was exorcised by a benevolent ex-nun. Now he just channels for his late ancestor once a month. We'd almost asked him about it once, but decided it wouldn't be tactful and bought felt top-hats instead, so it would look like we'd meant to come in and buy something.\n\"Well,\" I said, once we were on the bus, \"There's nothing on the front page. Do you think they'd put something that important inside without a leader to it on the front page?\"\n\"I wouldn't think so, but you never know with the way the Tribune's been lately.\" He had his parents send him the week's issues every Saturday, so he'd know how things were at home, \"Because no one who really loves you will tell you the dirt on your hometown during finals.\" I was just as willing to remain ignorant of local events myself. They took too much energy away from my classes, and I knew I'd hear everything once I got home. Besides, my attention span is short enough, without the added distraction of trying to keep track of a thousand people I wish I didn't know anyway.\nI looked through the rest of the paper, and there was no mention of the accident, although there was a sale on high-intensity light bulbs at Sears, and Leach was listed in the obituaries as having died at four o'clock from a gunshot wound.\nCollege Student Shot by Burglars\nLeach McBugnuts, the only son of our own Troy and June McBugnuts of 76 Oklahoma Dr., was shot by burglars yesterday in his mother's kitchen. He was twenty years old, and would have graduated in a year and a half from The University of Oregon where he was a major in Literary Theory (No, we aren't sure what that is either, but maybe Troy or June could tell us. Troy? June?). At any rate, the whole town feels this loss. Although Leach was always an odd child, we all loved him like he was our neighbor's only boy, which he was. Strength June, and you too Troy.} Services will be held Saturday at three pm. And may the Lord bless Leach McBugnuts and his bereaved family.\n`May the Lord bless Leach McBugnuts and his bereaved family.' Hmph.\nI decided not to point it out to Leach, although it did seem relevant. How could his family be \"bereaved\" if they were dead? I doubted he'd be reassured. I pointed out, instead, a piece about burglars and the practice of finding out when a house would be empty from funeral announcements. I also told him there was no mention of any incubator accidents.\n\"Did you check the horoscope section? Let me see that.\"\nI handed him the paper. He was making me really nervous, and his obituary didn't help much either, so the paper shook a bit as I passed it. He seemed not to notice, though, and I relaxed as well as I could. I normally wouldn't have worried about strange behavior from Leach -- he's been kind of strange as long as I've known him; not surprising when you consider he had to grow up with a name like his. If my name was Leach McBugnuts, I'd probably be pretty weird, too. But this was stranger than his usual Leach-ness.\nI watched him pore over the horoscopes for a few seconds, and marvelled that he seemed to really BELIEVE the things he was saying. He looked up, eyebrows raised. \"That's very odd,\" he said, \"There's not even anything in the horoscopes. See what I mean about how things have gotten in the journalism world? The Tribune doesn't even cover my parents' incubator disaster, and they're the ones who predicted the damn thing!\"\nI was about to say something about the reliability of the horoscopes anywhere, and especially in the Tribune, but was denied the opportunity, because (much to the relief of our fellow passengers, who had finally given up staring at us and begun diligently ignoring us) we arrived at our stop just then. We paid the driver, and said, no we wouldn't be needing a transfer slip, but thank you anyway, and got off the bus.\nThe ten minute walk to his house was tense, so I tried to make conversation.\n\"You were singing Pajama Game lyrics, huh?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"So...when d'you get into the theatre? New interest at school?\"\nHe just shot me an irritated glance. The rest of the trip was pretty quiet. I pointed at a few of the places we used to haunt. There was the Superman phone booth we used to use to change our clothes after school -- we got arrested once. Boy was my mother mad! \"Mrs. Beaulieu? Your son was found naked in a telephone booth about fifteen minutes ago. Could you come down to the station and pick him up?\" I wish I could've seen the look on her face!\nThe livestock in his gravel driveway helped to reassure me that, no matter how strange the rest of the world got, some things would remain consistent: there were chickens everywhere. They waddled around the yard, in and out the hole in the wire fence around the chicken coop, jumped up and down the steps to the front door of the house itself, scratched the lawn up, ate Mrs. McB's tomato stalks, and generally wrecked havoc on the yard. Those chickens had more freedom than Leach did until we were old enough to drive. I asked, once, why his father didn't fix the coop, but Leach only shrugged and said, \"That's how the old man likes to have the hens -- all over the place. That's how he knows they're alive. He gets nervous if the yard is too quiet, you know.\" Leach had smiled wisely at me, and nodded as his father passed through the room, as though this were the conventional wisdom, and wasn't I lucky to have heard it.\n\"See Leach?\" I gestured around the yard, encompassing most of the chickens. \"Just like always: hens everywhere.\" The windows to the farmhouse were all open -- at least all the ones I could see -- and the screen porch was in slightly better shape than the henhouse. Apparently Mr. McB didn't want the fowl in his living room. We went up the porch steps, but Leach hesitated before he opened up the door.\n\"Go on.\"\n\"Morbid son of a...\"\nHe opened the door, and we went in. It was about one o'clock in the afternoon, by then, and I could hear noises from the kitchen and upstairs. I could smell egg salad, too, and I began to remember that I still hadn't eaten breakfast.\n\"There. Smell that? You're parents aren't dead -- your mom is in the kitchen making egg salad, and your father is upstairs. Do you feel better now?\" I tried not to sound condescending or sarcastic, but he was being so weird that day that I wasn't sure what to make of it.\nHe looked at me with his brow crinkled, and said, \"Well -- I guess so. I'd like to see the incubator, though, just to make sure.\"\nSigh. \"Leach? Do you trust me?\"\nHe nodded. \"You've never led me wrong before, at least not without letting me in on the joke a few minutes later. And you've never been a joker about anything that was really important.\"\nHE was accusing ME of joking about something important? I couldn't believe this. But I controlled myself: I said, \"Go into the kitchen and say hello to your mom. I'll check the incubator shed and let you know what I find. If there are any bodies in there, we'll call the police, okay?\"\n\"I guess so.... Meet me in the living room in about fifteen minutes?\"\nI nodded, and went back outside.\nThe smell got stronger as I approached the incubator shed, which was strange since the kitchen was on the other side of the house. By the time I got to the door, the smell was so strong that I could hardly breathe. It was obviously not the smell of egg salad, I decided. Too strong. This was the stink of rotten eggs. I heard a gunshot from the house, and looked back. I heard Leach scream, and a shadow in the window dropped out of view . I turned to run, but stopped, because I had just got a good look into the shed. The hand-- I threw up and ran into the woods.\nSometimes, when I'm sitting alone, I remember playing with Leach, there in the shed; we used to bring trucks in there and push them around on the dirt floor, through bridges we made from old bricks. That was before his parents bought the incubator.\nMy brother told me, once, that the Tribune ran an article about Leach that Thanksgiving. He even sent me a copy, but I never read it. It's still in the envelope in my desk drawer, probably yellow by now.\nI don't read the Tribune anymore.\nWe, the editorial staff of the Tribune, would like to extend our deepest regrets for the early release of the Leach McBugnuts obituary. We wish to apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\nEndnotes:\n*1* New York: Richard Adler Music and J&J Ross Company New York : Frank Music Corp. ,(c)1980, 1952.\nBill Racicot is one of five surviving humanists at Carnegie Mellon University.

They rule in dark splendor over every lawn with trees.\nAnd the deciduous do not darken alone. The evergreens too feel the blight, if it is a blight. Whole pine forests are dropping black needles in the places pines grow; Christmas tree wholesalers are desperate. The science section of the newspaper had a long article on the problem, the point of which was that no one understood what the problem was. No one even knew about it before last year; and few believed it to be serious before this September.\nWe shall all suffocate slowly, my husband says. He is referring to the common belief that it is the world's forests which supply our oxygen. I do not trust this. There are too many other plants for the trees to be so vital, I think.\nWe are going to the woods, he and I, and our daughter, to see something which may be going out of the world.\nPacking the supplies we need in several boxes and putting those into the trunk on top of the tent, I am able to stop thinking over and over that this is the last camping trip I shall take. I am able to trust my mind while my hands are occupied.\nTricia helped me pack for a while but tired quickly and went to take a nap. Now she will be awake for the ride, which means whining and silly games. If I am lucky, Allen will be in a cheerful mood and keep her occupied; otherwise I will have to do it. When we return, the leaves will cover the lawn, and we will not be able to see the grass.\nAllen read an article from the December issue of `Geo Science' on the train this afternoon. Photosynthesis has been replaced by a different but closely related process in trees, which releases ammonia in small quantities, as well as oxygen and carbon dioxide. It creates some kind of long chainlike molecules in the leaves. Allen says it's like the leaves are a plastic factory instead of a food factory.\nI told him that was impossible, it would kill the trees. It is killing them, he said. I still didn't believe it, but I stopped arguing. He'd read the article, not me.\nSoon we are on our way to the campgrounds. Tricia plays window Bingo with Allen while I drive. The colorful billboards are a contrast to the black trees.\nWe put our tent up yesterday evening at twilight. When we arrived, there were at least thirty tents and motor homes; by the time we got our tent assembled nearly ten had left.\nThis morning there were fifteen still here. Allen and I dressed ourselves and Tricia and set out on a nature hike. Spotting a small yellow flower with dark green leaves, I asked Allen its name, was surprised that he didn't know. Tricia picked some dandelions. Except for the lack of brilliant foliage, the woods seemed the same as on any late October weekend.\nWe returned to our tent, Tricia clutching a fistful of dandelions with a black-eyed susan reigning over the bouquet. Allen had picked a handful of leaves off a maple tree which seemed especially afflicted. Its bark was much darker than it should have been, according to Allen. Having scattered the dandelions on the ground and placed the black- eyed susan on her sleeping bag, Tricia wandered over to where Allen and I sat talking. She wanted one of his black leaves; they were shinier and more attractive to her than the ones on the ground outside. Allen gave her one.\nI went to check on her and found her chewing on the leaf. Snatching it out of her hand wasn't enough; she'd swallowed some. Did she feel sick, Allen asked. No, she was fine. I'd taken her leaf away, Tricia said, even though she always chewed on leaves and grass blades at home.\nI tried to get Allen to take her to a hospital. You're being hysterical, he said. It was just a leaf. But these aren't just leaves, I said. They have ammonia, and plastic, and all that awful stuff in them. She'll be fine, he said. Do you want to upset her? he asked. But she did get sick. She got a terrible stomach ache and vomited until she was exhausted; we left the campground and arrived home early this evening. She seems to be completely recovered. I hope I will sleep well tonight; I should, since I will be in my own bed.\nI slept badly last night. I dreamed Tricia had died; her corpse was black and shiny. We laid her out in her coffin, covered her with black flowers and took her to the cemetery. Our minister, our friends, my parents all stood around the grave as Allen talked about long chainlike molecules. In the cemetery, there was grass as far as I could see: not one blade was green.\nDana Goldblatt never has admitted to preferring science fiction over other forms of fiction, except when it was cheaper at used bookstores.

Pornography was his life.\nThere was a demand for it, and he seemed to have a talent, or so his many editors told him, and as long as that demand and talent coincided, he would continue with his chosen line.\nOh, there was the occasional twinge of guilt-- not for what he did of course, for Charles was a pragmatic man, but for what he did not do; A real book, real literature, something to be proud of, a profession that he didn't have to hide away beneath his many pseudonyms. Indeed, he had started several serious books, only to give up, frustrated. Each quickly became boring without the added flavor, so to speak, that was Charles' unique style. And his books, after all, had paid for the house he lived in, kept him well fed and with a hefty bank account. He had done quite well for himself.\nOne might think it odd that Charles never actually did many of the things he wrote of in his many books and articles. He lived a very sheltered life. But that was fine with him. (What was that author's name, the woman who lived out in the moors in England and wrote?-- Well, it didn't matter.) Charles was in company with a lot of authors, writing about the human experience while too busy to join in. The only difference between he and they being the experiences he wrote about.\nAnother ritual consisted of bundling the manuscript up for a stop at the library-- photocopying it all was an expensive, but necessary, task, or so his lawyer told him. The industry was very cutthroat. A few big rubber bands kept it together nicely. Charles was engaged in this when there was a knock at the door.\nUnfortunately Charles was the type of person who never used the small peephole provided for them to see potential criminals before letting them in. He opened the door wide, and wondered why there seemed to be nobody there, when he chanced to look down and beheld the creature.\nThrough the miracle of human perception, Charles was instantly able to determine that the creature before him was an alien. Not of this Earth. Not, one would suppose, from anywhere nearby at all.\nThe alien looked like a boulder. It was about three feet high, mostly round, in fact spherical, and a reddish-brown that might have looked almost comforting on a familiar object such as a rotten tomato. Its skin was wrinkled and worn, like an old leather jacket. Eyestalks sprouted from its right and left flanks, aimed at Charles. What looked like a tentacle sprouted from the side of the boulder (being careful not to get in the way of its eye) aiming a gun-- not a streamlined raygun, but a functional Colt .45-- directly at Charles. He backed away.\nThe alien rolled after him. To do this it flattened an area of itself facing Charles, so that it would tumble into the cavity thus created. The eyestalks on both sides of the creature rotated slightly but did not waver from him. Neither did the tentacle with the gun.\nAnother tentacle made an appearance. This one emerged (from behind the other eyestalk) wrapped around a square black box, grilled at one end. Squeaks and incomprehensible noises came from the creature, and from the box came a voice.\n``You,'' it said, ``are Charles Pennet.'' The box sounded electronic, with irregular pauses between its words.\nCharles swallowed. If given a few minutes, he might have said something, either to confirm or deny his name. Neither of these options presented themselves.\n``There is something which you will do for me.'' The alien rolled further into the room without asking for an invitation. Yet another tentacle emerged from the same side of its body as the first to snake around the doorknob and pull it shut.\nCharles was not sure how to react to the alien. His life had been very structured, very ordered, until now. The alien's presence offended him, in a way he could not really describe, not even to himself. Just as if a total stranger had nudged him with an unwanted elbow, the alien was an intrusion into his life, one he didn't really want, not just now. Charles felt a kind of anger rising inside him.\n``Now wait a minute. Wait a minute--'' He said, though there was really nothing he could think of to say to the creature.\nIt didn't care. Something reached out from the creature and pushed at his mind. Charles sank to the floor. He could see and hear, but he could not move. At least he didn't think he could move; it just seemed like moving so much as a finger didn't appeal to him at all. Laying as he was on the floor seemed, in the absence of other ideas, an excellent option. Anything else was not to be considered.\n``My place of origin,'' the alien explained, ``is known as Cetella. My name is unpronounceable and not important. What you will do for me is.'' The alien rolled closer to him, giving him the full benefit of a body odor that reminded him of egg salad, as it explained.\nCharles had just finished a particularly explicit novel for which he had real hopes just before he was contacted by the Cetellan alien, who had developed a taste for human books.\nThe Cetellan idea of literature was not at all the same as the human idea of literature. But some of their scrawlings intrigued it greatly. As it pored with glassy eyes over the mass of data the ship's computer had translated for it, it had found, here and there, something that piqued its interest.\nAnd it had decided, fatefully, that here was money to be made.\nRegretfully, humans being who they are, and Cetellans being what they are, it was necessary that some adjustments be made before anything of a potential money-making nature was introduced to the Cetellan culture at large.\nAnd the alien, whose name is unpronounceable by a human as well as unprintable by any human typesetter, had thought of a way. A way that involved as little work for it as possible.\nCharles wanted to hide in a corner somewhere and gibber. He somehow remained standing. ``What... what am I supposed to do?''\nThe gun, and the tentacle that held it, Occupied Charles' full attention, to the point that he had not heard much of what the alien was saying. Now he forced himself to listen.\n``It has taken me some time to find you. There is-- some literature which you will-- translate for me.'' The electronic voice paused before certain words, possibly because of its translator which had to look them up. ``You will change only certain species-specific passages, as I have machines to translate to my own language. I will leave you books and materials to help you.'' Then it waited for him to speak.\n``I don't understand this. You're... an alien!''\n``Human powers of perception are most impressive.''\n``What... what if I refuse?''\nThis question was obvious, and the boulder appeared to have worked it out beforehand. ``You have ten seconds to accept. otherwise, a-- virus will be introduced into your-- biosphere which will render it lifeless. This is your incentive to work for me. Remember it, and do not doubt that I will do as I say.''\nIt paused. ``Very well,'' it said. It produced another device, like a small computer, from somewhere inside its actual body, Charles supposed. ``This machine is -- pro- grammed with translations of an anatomy text of my race, and another book which will help you with what you are to do. The tentacle dropped the machine on Charles' desk nine feet away. ``You are to translate this book.'' The book slapped down next to the other machine. ``I will return in seven days. If the book has not been translated by that time, or if you have contacted -- authorities of your -- government in an attempt to avoid this task, the virus of which I spoke will be immediately vented into your planet's biosphere. I will leave now.''\n``Wha... wait, you can't--... ''\nThe alien turned to face him by spiraling like a top. ``Remember,'' it said, ``that you are translating the litera- ture into a different culture, and not language, as my dev- ices can manage that. Also remember to preserve the origi- nal... flavor... for which the writing was intended.''\nThe creature quivered, and began, ponderously, to roll across Charles' floor. One of its tentacles (this made a total of four; he wondered how many it had) opened the door for its owner. The creature rolled heavily down Charles' walkway into the dark, oblivious to its surround- ings, to a car waiting for it. Charles could see through the open door that the interior of the car had been removed, its windows artificially darkened. The car was cavernous inside. Charles watched the alien as it rolled aboard, lowering its vehicle with its weight.\nCharles shut his door. He had seen an alien. He had actually seen an alien.\nIt sounded like some stupid science fiction story.\nThe Cetellan's car drove off. Would it really destroy the Earth, or was it a bluff?\nCharles went to his desk to examine the machine the alien had given him. It seemed very simple; in fact instructions were written in English on the front. He figured out how to call up the anatomy text. He summoned the other, and discovered that it seemed to be the alien equivalent of a sexual self-help book. It was very detailed, and fascinating to someone in Charles' profession.\nThe title of the terrestrial book on his study, an ordinary hardcover, caught his attention. It was, he found, Lady Chatterly's Lover. This was the literature the Cetellan wanted him to translate.\nThe alien had not left unobserved. A Mrs. Edith Cummings lived next door to him, not knowing (of course) his exact occupation. Mrs. Cummings was an ardent Christian fundamentalist, her thoughts never straying from purity and good faith. She had always kept an eye on Charles, ever since he'd moved in. He was an easy man not to trust. There had been something shiftless about him, like he didn't really belong in this quiet upper-class neighborhood.\nAnd a chance look out her kitchen window, to investigate that strange car parked before her neighbor's house, proved her suspicions correct.\nCharles was keeping strange company, indeed.\nAliens.\nShe decided that this would do with some looking into.\nAll night and the next day the furious tapping of Charles' typewriter reached Mrs. Cummings' ears incessantly. Eventually the next afternoon the typing came to a halt, and she looked up from her knitting. A quick glance across her front yard told her that Charles had left the house. The time, she thought, was now.\nWalking slowly (so as not to arouse suspicion), she headed out of her own abode toward her neighbor's. She tried the door, and found that it was unlocked. Probably going out for something to eat, she thought.\nMrs. Cummings never wasted time. She examined drawers, closets, under beds. Charles' shower and bath did not escape her scrutiny. Eventually she got to the bookshelf, and was, predictably, shocked. ``Filth!'' she cried.\nAdorning the shelf were an uncountable number of books and magazines, their content easily identifiable by the racy pictures on the front. Mrs. Cummings was familiar with many of the titles, as she had participated in a book rally (burning) in which they had been prominently featured. This time, she examined the authors. The names all seemed to have something in common. Chuck Penn... C. Penter... all the names sounded very nearly like her neighbor, Charles Pennet.\nSuddenly it dawned on her. He had written them. HE was the author of this... this...\n``Filth!'' she said again, louder this time. In fact Charles was the reason the P section in many adult bookstores was disproportionately large.\nMrs. Cummings examined the typewriter and the paper that lay inside it, and unknowingly became the first Cetellan literary critic.\nShe saw him again, in the garden. Just to touch him, she thought. Just to stroke his tight, calloused skin would be heaven... suddenly she stopped. She realized her dorsal tentacle was fully extended! What would her husband say, if he knew? But... on the other hand, what would he say?\nHer first thought was to burn it-- burn it all! But then--\nNo, she thought. She would wait. The police would never understand.\nMrs. Cummings tried to put everything back where it had been, and after reading through the contents of the Cetellan reading machine, exited Charles' house barely five minutes before he returned.\nCharles knew it was the alien even before he heard the car door open. It was late again, and exactly one week after its first appearance. He was not too nervous. He had done what it demanded of him, finished the manuscript. The boulder would not sterilize the planet, and then all of this would be behind him.\nThis time it did not bother with knocking. The door swung wide, and closed again.\nHe looked up, and there was the alien. It still aimed the gun at him. Charles wondered where it had gotten it from.\n``You have done what I wish.'' A statement, not a question.\n``Yes.''\n``Give me the manuscript.'' Charles handed the pages to the alien, which put them in a case and concealed it inside itself.\n``You're not going to kill everybody?''\nIn response the alien produced two more hardcovers, placing them on the same corner of Charles' study again. He suddenly felt very sick. He had stayed up three nights... ``I will return,'' the Cetellan said, ``in six days. If this literature is not translated in the same manner as the previous sample I gave to you, I will sterilize--''\nAt that moment Charles' front door exploded inward, as though by some artillery burst. The doorknob sailed across the room, burying itself in the opposite wall. A woman entered, an old woman. She was carrying a shotgun. ``Mrs. Cummings!'' Charles said, astonished.\nMrs. Cummings saw the Cetellan, and her eyes took on a angry reddish color as she swung her weapon around toward it. ``Filth mongerer!'' he thought she shouted. This seemed to be all too fast for the alien to use its mind-push or the .45. She fired.\nThe boulder seemed to explode gore all over the room and Mrs. Cummings. Shredded typewriter paper flew every- where, the work of the last week scattered all over the room and spattered with what passed for alien blood. Charles, shocked but still retaining his senses, tried to shrink from her view, looking for a way to get past her without being killed.\nFrom his knowledge of Cetellan anatomy Charles figured the alien would not be easily killed by a gun like that, as its thick braincase was approximately in its middle and little else but muscle outside that. But Mrs. Cummings seemed to know that too. She took the alien's .45 from the floor and proceeded to pump the center of the bleeding mass full of bullets until the gun was out, then dropped it.\nCharles' rear doorknob poked him in the small of his back. He reached behind himself to open it, then saw the old woman had her shotgun on him now. ``Don't you move,'' she said. Ice coated his stomach. ``It was you,'' she said. ``You wrote that... that... ''\nThe word exploded, ``Filth!'' and the gun would have as well, but it only clicked. Two shots. Charles pushed his way past the woman, grabbed the alien's book and vacated the premises.\nThe alien body made an incredible media sensation when it was discovered, and Mrs. Cummings became an unwitting instant hero. Charles, who had changed his name so many times that it was almost a habit for him, managed to avoid the persistent reporters and the net of government agents trying to track him, until the sensation died down. Eventually he found another house-- smaller but much more isolated-- and bought a typewriter.\nCautiously, he checked the dead alien's sex-and-anatomy book, and was pleased to find it still operative. It was time to go to work.\nOf course he'd have to find one of the Cetellans again, but perhaps they would find him. They would deal with him on his own terms this time. There was a new demand, and Charles Prendergast intended to fill it.\nRobert Chansky is a CIS major due to graduate from UC Santa Cruz next year or whenever.

I moved there to witness the end of days, to see and to Chaim Bertman know a different kind of dirt. I moved to the machine to see my country have a heart attack.\"\nI MOVED TO THE MACHINE BECAUSE I WAS MOVED BY ITS ANIMAL ASSERTION AND ruthlessness, its conscienceless grace, and its mean, clever, stupid noise of being.\nThe machine has nerves and therefore disturbances; it has skin, hair, flesh, hunger, the other things; and its blood flows when it is cut. It sleeps and sometimes cries like an infant; it has a mother and a father; it has bones and it can break an arm; it has legs and kidneys, a liver, and all of the minor organs. The machine has a nice face, dark eyes with deep lines from grinning, a kind enough, pouty mouth, thick, clumsy, warm fingers, all of these kinds of things.\nThe machine has blood that pumps through its organs; it has a center, but no heart. And if one looks closely, it is clear that it has a mouth but no lips; it has a bladder and intestines, etc., but it can do away with any of these parts; it has animal calculations but not necessarily a mind; its skin and hair lie loosely on its surface, and like the damp moss coating coastal rocks, they are torn easily from the corpus; it respirates, but even its respirations are not vital. The machine emits a sweet, pungent smell particular to it. It is a moist amalgamation, made up of the skins and flesh of countless animals, insects, fish and birds. It has a center, but one that is arbitrary and ever-changing. It has center and a form, but no boundaries, as far as I can tell. I moved to the machine, because it was almost an animal, a beautiful, hilarious creature, cruel and fast. But whatever bestial in the machine caught sick and quickly died, and I soon found myself living in the droning, complaining machine of gears and work.\nI moved to the machine because I guessed that the Tower of Babel was not a myth. I moved there to witness the end of days, to see and to know a different kind of dirt. I moved to the machine to see my country have a heart attack.\nAt first, things were lively and careless. We danced almost until dawn in basement bedrooms and music lofts; we gorged upon cheap clams on the boardwalk and sickened on them happily and without complaints. We often stayed up the night talking, my friends and I, in a tiny, poorly lit cafe with narrow walls and a floor as filthy as an ashtray. The machine was freewheeling and wild in those days. People were doing it on the trains after hours, there was constant, miserable, and abandoned lovemaking going on underneath the tracks, in the coal cellars, under the streetlamps' orange glow past midnight. There was revolution on everybody's mind, like water on the brain. It seemed to everyone that only the most elemental things were worth preserving. It meant nothing to see a man shot in the face outside the three-flat. We spoke about freedom and justice, then changed the subject quickly, ashamed of our own cynicism and tired, dour tongues.\nSometime during that first Winter, I found I hadn't moved for weeks. I had been sitting at the window, as the snow rose and the streets turned white, the cars no longer rolling by; sitting, without sleeping, for weeks, no eating, skin and bones. The lightening storms of December took on a man-made glow. Thunder roared indistinguishably from the rumbling and whistling tumbling of the trains, always trains outside. The machine was alive and electrified with death, ceaselessness, agony and lead poisoning. People began to say that Nero had come back to life, and he was ready to raze the machine to the ground, to twist and crack its springs and stop up its gears with torn up human flesh; that Nero came back again and he liked to play the electric guitar through a hundred amp machine.\nBirds came to the machine, but only the thickest, most bloated, crawing scavengers stayed more than a hungry week or two. Starved rats and trashy back alley animals battled over crumbs. The ravaged, bug-eaten remains of cockroaches and beetles ended up on every counter and floor. Beneath the Earth, according to the Almanac, most of the animal life resided; and there, in the dark earth, confused and completely blind, these creatures lived short, nervous years; and many generations of creatures passed beneath the city in the lifetime of a single human being, generations knowing nothing but the ever-pounding and turning sounds of the machine above the Earth.\nAt the time, I myself lived in the basement of the Greyhound Bus Depot. I knew a man named Claytar who lived underneath the Police Station--and he hated cops. There were pigeons everywhere in these low dwellings; the floors flooded daily, and strangers tried to break in several times a month.\nThere was nothing going on at all. No one worked and we were all sick. The man named Claytar kept us alive with his beautiful voice and his songs about all of this. He never smiled and he made no promises. He had lost two fingers on his left hand, but despite this he had mastered the five string guitar. We sat at his feet and knew he knew something. He knew it and knew it and strummed it on the sidewalk:\n\"What did you have, my darling true, what did you have when you were there?\n\"We had nothing, and nothing, and nothing but rocks...\n\"You had rocks, my one true love? You had rocks? We dreamed of rocks...\n\"You had dreams? We murdered for dreams.\"\nClaytar spoke about coming to the machine:\n\"I came to the machine with a guitar on my back. The minute I got off the train, `started to walk; looking around to find out where I was, and a police car saw me and he slowed down. Now, I had no case to carry this guitar and I wasn't wearing nothing fancy to make it seem like I could own me such a fine instrument; `cause this guitar was studded with rhinestone inlays, and the frets and knobs were fresh polished, shining like the belly of a rotted oyster. But come on, man! They slowed down `cause I was carrying a guitar? The car went around the corner and ditched me, me and my guitar, but they circled the block back around.\n\"There was two `a them and the young one starts combing back his sandy brown curls. He rolls down the windows real cool and slumberly.\n\"`Is that yer guitar?' he asks.\nThe other one is off staring straight ahead, like a dead herd of oxen.\n\"`Yeah, sure is,' I said, though actually it's my brother's.\n\"`You play it?'\n\"`Of course...'\n\"`Well, would ya play something for us then?'\n\"Now, at this point I was deeply offended.\n\"`What?' I ask him, `You think I stole it?'\n\"`No, no,' said the young cop laughing, chewing and cracking gum, still combing back his sandy locks. `I used to play the guitar in high school. I just wanna hear you.'\n\"I don't know if it was a request or a demand. But I played as badly as I could, just hitting the strings around, jumping up and down the frets, all out of order. I tried to make it as unclear as possible, whether or not I'd ever touched a guitar before. They've got to know that a guy doesn't legally have to know how to play the guitar that good.\n\"After banging around a few seconds, I stopped playing, saying, `I don't write lyrics, you see, just melodies.' I went back to the atonal strumming. When I finished, the cop nodded his head, `said, `Tasty guy, tasty! Thanks...' He and his tombstone-faced partner shoved on up the street.\"\nClaytar never ate and he didn't drink water, and in this way he escaped the poisons that have made cripples of the rest of us. Still, he did go blind in his left eye and he caught a wet cough that stuck with him and became part of him. He lost track of time; and he lost his balance, so he couldn't stand up. He spoke and we listened, but he began to speak only in generalities:\n\"Living in the machine is like losing your sense of humor. Not seasons, but the changing complaints mark time; time, the enemy. Living in the machine is like losing your mind. Ears are stuffed with human voices, mouths gorge on human nonsense, human forms, humans smelling humans--therefore, there is no escape from imitation. The machine is fully human inside. Humans living too close to humans, knowing nothing else, human upon human, they become cannibals or excrement-eaters or humanist critics. Photographs, automobiles, movie houses--ask a dying person if they want to be remembered that way, as a stereotype, as something that can be extracted, abstracted and duplicated, an Earthly spirit trapped as a fleshy gear in the works of the machine. The most complicated tragedy of fate is not recognized; just its utensils and paraphernalia are noted, its bottles in a paper bag, its criminal sneers and fake gestures, Oedipus at Colonus drunk, staggering in a dumpster-diving lunatic freakout. There is nothing unique in the sound of a human voice, as heard through the machine. Only higher volume and discord distinguish one instrument from another in this bastard orchestra. Living in the machine is like having your wallet stolen.\"\nI started to write down Claytar's words in the Spring. He took it badly and screamed out something about the oral tradition, saying, \"What about the death of the written word?\"\n\"It'll come back,\" I said.\nClaytar was shot in the head on Easter Sunday, and I lost my faith.\nClaytar had screamed, \"What about the raging libraries--for three hundred years, we could stand to stop writing and relearn to read.\"\n\"But what about medical technology,\" someone surfaced saying.\n\"Yeah, and what about the changing of the human head?\"\nClaytar mumbled something bitterly: \"Soon the human race will have two stomachs and no heart. One day, the human creature will lose its hands. Then they shall invent history. The Tower was completed at Babel--what do you think this is?\"\nPalsied with anger, Claytar twisted and seemed ready to spit. I put down my pencil and he smiled. Let it permeate your bones, I told myself. Let Claytar be alive, and tell it when he ain't. Claytar stopped trembling long enough to tell us about Winter and love and about being alone in it, singing us a blue song:\nNobody ever tells you all the things you really want:\nHog jelly, a dusty rifle, rifling around for these things after its dark.\nNo Casanova, no monkey girl, will ever steal these things from my heart:\nMy motorcycle, my toothy dingo, the broken window in my cold three flat.\nNobody will ever sell you anything you really want...\nNo Spanish Honkey, no Mandingo, no nobody, ever tells you truely--to your face at least.\nAfter Claytar was shot, there wasn't much to say. We all pretty much broke up. I spent the days, unemployed, cross-eyed, wandering through the machine. The machine buzzed along hovering above me, speaking to me softly; it tried to take me in, string me along, but I refused to listen. Women and men are born and die in the machine, the machine eats their lives and their labor. I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't hum so constantly, clear its throat disgustingly, whistle like a drunkard or a postman, and go on like that.\nI entered the machine of my own volition, and it occurred to me finally to leave it that simply. So I took a walk, trying to find the edge of the machine. After many years of rambling, it occurred to me what could never be proven, merely intuited: That the machine was a globe without a center and without boundary; I found its parts, metal clutches and windings, wooden handles, concrete and glass floorboards; but I never found a single part without which it simply could not operate, and try as I might, I could not discover the whereabouts of its edges.\nI began my exit. I left behind the city and towns, the farms, and eventually all traces of humanity, but the Machine continued. I encountered limitless forms within the machine, all suspended in a medium at times gaseous, at times liquid or solid, at times something quite different. I wept and punched my face and tore at my clothes--why did I ever come to the machine? I stamped the exasperated ground, secretly hoping that it would open up like a face and devour me. The machine proved more clever and heartless than I could have imagined. It has permeated me, undetectable to the eye, but so thoroughly that I too no longer have a heart, just a center; and my own blood and bones are temporary and almost useless; and I can be destroyed in part but not in whole, bent but not ruined, even under a surgeon's cold scalpel, even pinched by the thumb and forefinger of death, even mixed up with the acids of creation in the boundless stomach of God, even in the cruel, unceasing logic of the Machine.","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

Owen Sometimes you get in and you don't come out.\" Copyright (c) 1993\n\"I tell you, Doc, the tix rate's up.\"\nDr. Walter Donly reached for his keyboard and hit the system statistics hot key. Just inside his office door the husky service technician stood shifting his weight from foot to foot. \"I appreciate your concern, John,\" Walt said as the screen filled with data, \"but you know as well as I do that the matrix error rate is determined by laws of physics. It doesn't change.\" He gestured at the screen. \"Last month's error rate was one in 188,000. That's close enough to the mean for me.\"\nJohn Beach still looked skeptical. Walt sighed and wondered if they would ever understand. Running two matrix error service calls in a single day always convinced the techs that system parameters had changed--or had been changed. John had been in before, for the same reason, as had most of the techs. Walt wondered what incident had brought this on.\n\"I can call stats, too,\" John said. \"But that doesn't explain sites that tix twice in a week. What are the odds on that?\"\n\"That's statistics. You throw five dice, sometimes you get Yatzee. The chance may be small, but it happens.\"\n\"Twice in a month?\" John asked.\n\"For a single site?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIn his entire service apprenticeship, Walt had never seen a site tix twice in a single week. In a morbid fashion he was jealous. \"Sounds like you hit the lottery,\" he said.\n\"Some, lottery, Doc. What are the odds, anyway?\"\nWalt sighed. John was going to be tedious. But he was curious, too. \"Let's see,\" he said, clearing the screen and summoning a statistics calculator on the office computer. John moved into the office and sat down.\n\"OK, pods average thirty uses a day,\" he began. He was entering equations as he spoke. \"The nominal error rate is one in 189,788. So the chance of an error on any particular day is...\" He hit the calculate key. \"...one in 6,387.\"\n\"See what I mean,\" John said.\n\"Now hold on. Divide that by seven, and the chance of an error in a week drops to one in 912.\"\n\"That's still pretty high.\"\n\"Not when you account for volume. With half a billion pods out there, one in 912 is nothing.\"\n\"I know there's a lot of pods. But what's the chance of two errors in a week?\"\n\"Simple. 912 raised to the second power.\" He pressed the keys.\n\"831,744,\" John announced. \"Good God. You're not going to tell me that's normal.\"\n\"John, surely you realize the scale of the transporter system. With the number of pods out there, this situation will happen on an average...\" He again consulted the computer. \"...over 600 times a week.\"\nJohn stared at the screen. \"Damn system's murder,\" he said.\n\"In a way, but we have to have it. How would you get to work if you couldn't tee? Hell, John, you know the odds. You work with the system.\"\n\"Yeah, but I try not to think about them.\"\n\"That's the way the system works. Sometimes you get in and you don't come out.\" No one knew that better than the service technicians. When they ran a matrix error call, it generally meant that someone had died.\n\"Well, I would still like to know the chances of a single site tixing twice in one week -- two times in a month.\"\n\"Hmm,\" Walt said. \"That's a bit tougher.\" He pulled up a statistics text to help work out the equation. After entering it the result startled even him. \"One in thirty five million?\"\n\"For me only?\" John asked.\n\"That's what it looks like. But there are 100,000 service technicians. It's just economy of scale.\"\nJohn abruptly stood up. \"You guys always hide behind that economy of scale crap. You really don't give a shit. A lot of people are getting fried in your damn system, and you call it economy of scale. Why don't you do some checking for a change instead of spouting statistics.\" He turned and stormed out of the room before Walt could reply that that was what the system stats were for. The door slid shut, leaving the room echoing with indignation.\n\"Damn,\" Walt said. He hated scenes like that, and there seemed to be an epidemic of them, lately. Most of the problem stemmed from ignorance. The techs always felt the system could be manipulated. As he had done a dozen times before, he pulled up a stock tpod physics summary and began editing it. He would e-mail it to his service section. Maybe it would calm some of them. If, of course, any of them read it.\nHe looked at the report and knew it would go right over the heads of the service technicians it had been written for. They refused to accept that the natural D-Wave could not be manipulated or monitored. When a transmit D-Wave synchronized with the natural D-Wave--which it did a fixed percentage of the time--a matrix error occurred. The transmit synchronizer would burn out and the matter to be transmitted would be stuck in the D-dimension. No system failure could possibly cause that error. The equations did not lie; the odds stayed the same.\nHe tried his best to work the document to a point where it would be understandable, but finally dropped it as hopeless. \"Do some checking for a change,\" John had said. Well, he thought, maybe I will.\nHe pulled John Beach's file and work log and examined them, looking for the cases in question. John hadn't been exaggerating. His double errors were real. Looking further, he saw that John's tix call rate was running ten a week--nearly twice normal. \"Jinx?\" Walt said. It wasn't a logical thought, but it had crossed his mind.\nHe called up another record. Mike Thompson, also in his division, yielded a tix call rate of nine a week. The same held true for several other techs he checked.\n\"Increased volume?\" It seemed unlikely that traffic would have doubled on the system, but he checked anyway. The usage report said volume was down two percent in the last month; that certainly wasn't the problem.\nWalt was getting nervous. Matrix central continuously monitored matrix errors, maintaining stats for the system at all times. No increase in the error rate, even within a single division, should go unnoticed.\nHe wrote a quick program to do a subset stat analysis through his local service link to matrix central. The program ran for a few seconds, then posted results. He stared at the screen in horror. Commercial class pods showed an error rate within one percent of the norm. Class three pods, commonly used for human transportation, were showing an average of one error in 82,134 uses. It was impossible.\nHis math had to be wrong. He double checked his equations, but they proved accurate. Perhaps the small sample base of fifty thousand sites had yielded skewed results. He increased it to a million sites and ran the program again.\nThis time the wait was in the minutes and, when the results were posted, the error rate had converged to one in 82,151. Either the error rate was high, or the computer had erroneous data. His service link yielded actual use statistics for individual sites. He had no reason to doubt the data's integrity.\n\"What is going on?\" In spite of the air conditioning, he was beginning to sweat. He hit a blue button on the wall that locked his office. He didn't want anyone to drop in while he had that information on the screen.\nRemembering the sites John had mentioned, he wondered if some sites were failing in some unknown way and had high error rates. He entered a scan routine to query for locations with higher than normal error rates, hoping that that would give him something to go on.\nHe allowed the program to scan the million sites he had previously run stats on. After a few seconds a list appeared of locations with unusually high error rates. He was surprised to see the list headed by four class six industrial sites that were tixing one hundred percent. What he saw violated known physical laws. It was obvious that he didn't know all the laws, and someone else did. There was no doubt that the system was being manipulated.\nWondering if the results went the other way, he changed parameters and ran the program again. Hundreds of sites were revealed with zero error rates over the last ten years. The problem of matrix errors could be controlled and prevented. Someone knew. Someone was not telling.\n\"Matrix Computer Disconnect\" popped up on the screen in a dialog box. Walt froze. Abruptly the phone rang and he nearly jumped out of his chair.\nHe paused for a moment to let his breathing steady before answering the phone.\n\"Dr. Donly?\" a man inquired.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"This is Matrix Control. We are seeing a high level of inquiry traffic on your channel. May I ask what you are doing?\" The voice failed to mention that they had disconnected his channel.\n\"Oh, the techs were saying that the error rate is up, as usual. I just was checking to make sure.\"\n\"System statistics are available for that purpose.\" The man at the other end seemed more instructive than angry. Walt was really at a loss for what to say. He had been nosy, and they knew it. They undoubtedly had a log of his accesses.\n\"I wanted data for my section. Stats are for the entire system,\" he said.\n\"The accesses were not all in your section. We logged accesses system-wide.\"\n\"Oh, I made an error in the program. Can I request stats for my section?\"\n\"I will forward the appropriate forms to your office. But for now, I have an order to suspend you for the day. You are logged off. Please go home.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied as the line clicked dead. Walt had never heard of suspensions before. He contemplated the consequences. Would he lose his job? Why couldn't John mind his own business.\nHe reached for the key to clear local session memory, but hesitated before hitting it. Instead he ran a print of the session log. Fifteen crisp white sheets slid from a slot on the side of the terminal. He then cleared the memory and pocketed the data.\nLeaving the office, he headed for the floor tpod. It waited at the end of the hall--just a sliding door and a light announcing pod availability. He stopped before entering. I'm just being paranoid, he thought, and entered the pod. He slid his ID through the reader and punched in his home address code. The unit beeped once, announcing initiation of a transmit cycle. The door had nearly closed when he slammed the abort button.\nHe stepped out and eyed the pod with apprehension. He'd teed somewhere every day of his life. Sure there was risk, but he accepted that risk. Everyone did. That transporter represented his only way home. But it had taken on a new, dimension as a result of his little session of snooping. It suddenly seemed likely that he might not emerge from the other end of the transport.\nHe reached in and keyed the activation sequence again. When he had pressed the last button, he pulled his hand clear so the door could close and the unit could transport several cubic meters of air to his house. The cycle light came on. The unit activated.\nThe soft chiming began at the same time the matrix error indicator lit. Above the door \"out of service\" was blazed as if to proclaim, \"sorry, you will have to go\ndown the hall for your chance.\" Walt froze for a moment, then turned and ran.\nHe didn't know where he was running to, but he had to get away from all tpods. He had to get help, to tell someone. He knew he couldn't tee anymore, so how would he reach help? He did not even know where he lived in relation to matrix central. Tpods moved the world. Now that he couldn't use them anymore, he felt stranded.\nThen he remembered the air cars. He was even on the correct level. He had used the cars during his apprenticeship as a service technician. When a pod suffered a receive failure, a tech had to get to it some other way, so matrix central maintained a fleet of air cars and small spacecraft. He headed for the docks.\nWhen he reached the dock entrance, he tried to remember air car procedures. It had been ten years since he had flown one, but they mostly flew themselves anyway. He remembered the check-out routine, but with no valid service ID or authorization that wouldn't work.\nAs he walked in the door he surveyed the docking area. The vast room was filled with the large delta wing vehicles, some parked in neat rows ready for use, others in various stages of disassembly. One sat in launch position, pointed down the launch corridor.\n\"I need to check out an air car,\" he said to the boy at the entrance. The only occupant of the room, the young man looked all of seventeen. He wore a flowered shirt and a smudge on his chin revealed a desire for manliness through blade shaving. Of course, he was in charge of air cars. On the desk he had the usage log and a full box of key cards.\n\"I need to see your ID, work order, and authorization,\" he said.\n\"Here is my ID,\" Walt said, handing over the card. \"I don't need authorization, I'm a supervisor.\" It never hurts to try, he thought.\n\"I can't issue based on just an ID, sir. I'll have to call for authorization.\" He reached for the phone.\nSometimes the best way is the direct way, Walt thought. It worked on tri-V. As the boy's hand snaked toward the phone and he was looking down, Walt bundled his fingers into a fist and slugged the kid with all his might. The boy, chair and all, fell backwards to the floor.\nWalt hoped that he had knocked him out, but he hadn't. The boy jumped up from the floor and for a moment Walt was afraid he would be involved in a fist fight. But the kid cowered back into the corner, obviously not wanting any more trouble.\nWalt grabbed the phone and yanked. Expecting the wonderful movie gesture of wires ripping free from the wall, he instead found the wire to be quite strong, so he resorted to throwing the phone to the floor. The plastic case, not designed for such abuse, shattered.\nHe grabbed his ID and the box of keycards. Running to the ready car, he heard the boy escaping out the door. He would have very little time to get going. He jumped in the car, sealed the door, and began trying cards. The fifth card he tried activated the control panel. He dropped the box of cards, flipped the controls to manual, and jammed the throttle all the way forward. Acceleration forced him into the seat as the air car flashed down the launch corridor and into the sky.\nOnce clear of the opening it began to drop. Walt grabbed at the yoke and pulled. The craft yawed to the right, then pulled up, just clearing a stand of trees. He had overcorrected and the ship almost stalled, but he pushed forward lightly and leveled out. It had been years since his training, but the motions quickly returned. Soon he had control of the car and was confronted with the awful decision of where to go.\nHe pulled the crumpled sheave of papers from his pocket. The top page gave the address. He punched it into navigation and felt the car assume automatic control. It veered to the right and began to ascend.\nAs the air leveled out, Walt wondered if he would be followed. The only use for air cars was transporter pod maintenance, so he didn't expect to meet any normal traffic. Of course, the key cards for all the cars in the dock were scattered on the floor at his feet. If duplicates existed, they would take a while to find, he was sure. He always likened TP Technologies to an elephant--damn big, and awfully slow. Obviously, at some higher level that was not the case. Still, that level had to deal with the norm, and the norm consisted of two million employees and no one in charge.\nThe air car released to manual after two hours flight time. Walt found himself over a wooded valley occupied by a single log cabin. Far in the distance another cabin could be seen, but the spacing was several kilometers. John Beach obviously liked his privacy.\nThe yard in front of the house had a clearing large enough to land the craft. He sat the car down gently in the grass, hoping to cause little damage to the idyllic setting.\n\"What the hell,\" he heard as the hatch opened. The noise had apparently aroused John. Walt reasoned that he was the first visitor John had ever had via air car. He stepped out to meet his host.\n\"Donly!\" John stood there in the grass. He was barefoot and holding a beer. For the first time, Walt noticed his pot belly. With the diet drugs available, he wondered if the belly had been grown on purpose to achieve a look John particularly desired.\n\"I've got to talk to you,\" Walt said.\n\"I guess you do. Why didn't you just tee in, like regular folk.\" John was getting quite a kick out his guest's strange arrival.\n\"John, I need your help. I checked into what you said, and I found something real bad. Can we talk?\"\n\"Sure, come on in.\"\n\"I'd better not. You may be in danger, too. Can you come with me?\"\n\"Good God, Doc. You show up in an air car in the middle of the afternoon and want me to go flying? I haven't done anything. Why should I be in danger.\"\n\"You wanted me to check. I did. Someone is tampering with the tpod error rate.\"\n\"I told you so.\"\n\"Now they're trying to kill me. They may try to kill you, too. Right now, I don't trust any tpods, including your house unit.\"\nJohn stared at Walt for a moment, then glanced back at the house. \"Give me a sec,\" he said and ran into the house. Less than a minute later, he emerged in a denim jacket and boots, with two beers.\nNot normally the drinking type, Walt gratefully accepted one. \"Get in,\" he said, jumping back in the air car. Once John was buckled in he lifted off, turned\neast, and began to relate his story.\n\"Where are we going, now?\" John asked as he examined the computer printouts.\n\"I figured we would try to find a tri-V network or some other news agency to break this. With enough publicity, we would be safe,\" Walt said. \"I don't think we can go to the police. They would probably arrest me for stealing the air car, and TP would get me the moment they pop me in a pod.\"\n\"So, where...\" John began. The sky suddenly flared a brilliant white. Both men closed their eyes against the glare. Then the shock wave hit, and the air car began tumbling. John grabbed the controls, yelling, \"let me.\" He fought them madly as the sky and ground did wild acrobatics. Trees below burst into flames, then were uprooted by the shock wave. As the ship tumbled the men caught brief glimpses of a rising mushroom cloud in the distance.\nAfter a desperate battle, John managed to level the craft out. He got it back on an easterly course. \"Minimal damage,\" he said as he surveyed the instrumentation. \"We seem to be ok, but if that was a nuke, we're irradiated now.\"\n\"I doubt it. I bet there was no radiation at all,\" Walt replied.\n\"What do you mean. That was a nuke if I ever saw one.\"\n\"A different kind of nuke. Are you familiar with energy venting?\"\n\"Sure. I sometime work on an EV unit. It drains energy from matrix error mass loss and converts it to electricity.\"\n\"Yeah, but do you know how they work?\" Walt asked.\n\"No, not really. I guess it's similar to other tpods. They use the same parts.\"\n\"When something--or someone--is tixed, they are stuck in the D-dimension. Matter isn't stable there, so it converts directly to energy. EV units tap that energy in a controlled way by generating a simultaneous transmit and receive D-Wave for the same location. This causes an energy release from the field. The energy level is determined by the intensity of the field. Many people know that. What most people don't know is that any tpod can be used as an EV unit, since most tpods transmit and receive. A lot of safeguards have to be overridden, but it can be done.\"\n\"They detonated the tpod in my house?\" John had turned white, obviously realizing for the first time that he had become a target, too.\n\"I think so. The problem with using a regular tpod as an EV is that the vent can't be controlled. It just dumps a large mass equivalence instantly. The best it can be toned down to would be the equivalent of a medium nuke,\" Walt said. \"Like that.\"\n\"You son of a bitch,\" John yelled. \"You led them to me. Now they're after me, too.\" John had regained his color and was glaring at Walt. He looked ready to kill.\n\"You started this, John,\" Walt replied. \"You asked me to do the checking. Now we're in this together.\"\n\"But you could have stayed your distance. You didn't have to lead them to me.\"\n\"Hell, I don't think I led them to you. I had your coordinates already, so I didn't have to inquire of navigation. They may have been going to hit you anyway. I probably saved your life.\"\n\"I doubt that,\" John said. He looked unconvinced. \"How do you know they can't track this air car?\"\n\"I don't think they can. If they could, why would they wait for us to be out of range? They sure missed.\"\n\"They didn't miss my house.\"\n\"I think I would rather be alive and homeless, if I were you,\" said Walt. \"We had best work together. You have any ideas?\"\n\"Well, where the hell are we going. You've got us pointed east, but that means nothing to me. I live by tpod coordinates.\"\n\"I seem to remember reading that the major tri-V nets are all on the east coast. I think New York. I remember some geography from school. New York is on the east coast of the Americas, and I think that's where we are, so I'm heading that way.\"\n\"How will we find the right place when we get there.\"\n\"Hell, John, you got any ideas?\" Walt looked at him. \"I'm doing the best I can to get us out of this mess. Maybe we'll look for antennas. We could ask directions.\"\n\"Great. Sarcasm. Antennas might work.\" He added, \"I think I live near the coast. I saw a map when I bought the cabin. New York should be north, if I remember correctly.\" He adjusted their course.\nThey flew for over an hour above terrain that varied from long, empty fields to mountain peaks. Occasionally a small town or city dotted the landscape, to be replaced again by green grass and pasture land. They marveled at the feeling of flight, so seldom felt in a world of instantaneous transportation.\nSuddenly the land became water. Below them waves broke on the beach. Even in the filtered cabin, the ocean smell hung heavy in the air. They turned north and followed the coast line until an island city came into view.\n\"New York?\" John asked. They were both straining to see in the haze. The sun was setting, painting the shiny box world ahead in shades of red and gold.\n\"I guess so. Hell, I don't know. Let's give it a try.\" They swooped down over the city like a bird of prey. Every building seemed to have at least one antenna, but few had more. \"See that one,\" Walt said, pointing at a mirrored skyscraper to the north.\n\"Yeah. Looks like a farm on the roof. Let's give it a try.\"\nThey flew to the building. Dozens of antennas sprouted from the roof, but a large, cleared circle with a painted red X marked a landing spot. The paint had faded, but the area was clear. John sat the craft down on the pad and they disembarked.\nA cool, evening breeze cut through their clothes and occasional gusts threatened their balance. \"Tough wind up here,\" John said.\n\"Over here.\" Walt pointed at a red brick block with a door. It looked like the access way for the roof. \"Let's try it.\"\nThe door was unlocked. Upon entering they found themselves at the top of a stairwell that spiraled off to the left, circling an open center shaft.\nThey went down one flight and looked at the door. The handle had been lost long ago. \"Let's try the next one,\" Walt said. They found it unlocked and pushed it open. It bumped against something, then gave way.\n\"Gosh, you scared me half to death,\" the girl said. Her whitened cheeks\nformed a contrast to the heavy rouge she had applied. She reached up and brushed an offending strand of blond hair from her eyes, stalling for time as she regained composure. \"What were you doing in the stairwell?\"\n\"We are trying to find the press,\" Walt said. \"Are we close?\"\n\"This is the GTV building,\" she replied. Walt breathed a sigh of relief. Global Tri-V was one of the biggest networks. They would help.\n\"I need to talk to a reporter,\" he said. He felt no need to explain to this girl He wanted to go straight to someone important. \"Can you get someone?\"\n\"Ok,\" she said and zipped from behind the desk, not turning her back until well out of range. A hallway extended the breath of the building. She disappeared to the right at the end of the hall.\n\"Thank goodness,\" John said. \"Let's get this mess over with. Someone in TP owes me a house and I intend on taking it out of his hide.\"\n\"I wish it were as simple as replacing your house,\" Walt replied. He gazed down the hall, anxious for an end to the affair. He noticed the tpod on the left near the end of the hall The blue availability light glowed above the door. He shuddered for a moment, then calmed.\nThe reporter stepped into the hall and headed toward them with long, confident strides. Walt could feel her assessing them as she approached, wasting no time getting to the story. Her business suit clung tightly to her slim body with no loose cloth. Her hair was cropped close in a style that could grace the screen, yet not get in the way. She brandished a notepad as a warrior would a gun.\n\"Shiela Haskel, GTV,\" she said when she was within range. She extended her hand. \"What can I do for you.\"\nWalt shook her hand. \"I'm Dr. Walt Donly. This is John Beach. We're employees of TP Technologies, and we've got quite a story.\"\n\"Come with me to my office,\" she said. \"We'll be more comfortable there.\" She turned on her heels and the men followed. Walt noticed the secretary regaining her territory, obviously glad to be back in charge of her little corner of the world.\nThey went down the hall and entered an elevator. \"My office in on level eighteen,\" Shiela said, pressing the button. \"Perhaps you can tell be what this is about?\"\nWalt began telling her of the information he had discovered and his subsequent flight. The elevator stopped. They exited and went down another hall to a corner office. He paused while they entered. \"Please be seated,\" she said, motioning at the two chairs facing the desk. Walt wondered if most news stories involved two people.\n\"Please continue,\" she said, all the while jotting notes. Other than an occasional \"OK,\" or \"Right,\" she let Walt relate the story uninterrupted.\n\"Are you sure this is not just statistics at play?\" she asked when he had finished. She appeared unimpressed by the magnitude of the tale.\n\"If it weren't for those four sites, I couldn't be certain. I guess odds could be pushed, but not that far. Those sites are impossible. Someone is doing that.\"\n\"And I know I've been seeing more tixs than usual in the last few months,\" John added.\n\"Do you have any physical evidence?\" she asked. Walt eyed her for a moment. Was she skeptical, or just thorough?\n\"I have this,\" he said, handing over the prints he had run earlier. She thumbed through them for a moment, apparently absorbing the data.\n\"What do these numbers really mean, Doctor?\"\n\"What do you mean?\" he inquired.\n\"In lives.\"\nHe had avoided thinking in those terms before. \"I didn't run that number.\"\n\"Care to hazard a guess?\"\n\"Oh, an extra twenty million a year. Maybe more.\" The magnitude of the problem struck home for the first time. \"Can't you get this on the air and stop it?\" he begged.\nShe sat the papers down and clasped her hands over the desk. \"I would like to, but there is a problem. I can't break a story like this without physical evidence or independent corroboration. It's too big.\"\n\"What,\" John yelled. \"You mean you're not going to do anything?\"\n\"We are going to do something. I really want to blow this story wide open. This is huge, but we have to be careful. You are not the first to make such a claim.\"\n\"Not the first?\" Walt asked.\n\"No. About fifty years ago, an employee of TP came to GTV and said that matrix errors could be controlled and TP management was using them to produce power. He had internal prints and statistics to prove it.\"\n\"You mean you've known this for fifty years?\"\n\"Hold on. The guy turned out to be a fraud. The prints he had were faked. We aired the story and raised quite a ruckus, only to be sued by TP. Hell, TP damn near ended up owning the place. It hurt the network's credibility, so we have to be real careful about our sources, especially on a story like this.\"\n\"You don't believe us,\" John said. His hands were balled up in fists.\n\"Of course I believe you. For one thing, you came here by air car. That's not what I would call a normal occurrence. And there are two of you. These prints could be fake, but they look real. We will just have to find some way to prove this.\"\n\"What about my house?\" John asked. \"Surely someone noticed!\"\n\"Let me check.\" Shiela activated the terminal on her desk and entered a command sequence. \"Here it is. A large meteorite impact occurred in eastern Tennessee earlier today. According to government sources, the meteorite struck in a sparsely populated area, destroying a few homes and a great deal of timber. Casualties are minimal. End of story. There you go.\"\n\"Meteorite, my ass,\" John exclaimed.\nA slow whistle escaped Walt's lips. \"Would seeing the computer results yourself be sufficient proof?\" he said.\n\"You're crazy,\" John said.\n\"Calm down, John,\" Walt said. To Shiela, \"we might be able to get in.\"\n\"If I could verify personally that this information came from the matrix computer, I could break the story. Without that assurance, I'm stuck.\" She seemed sincere in her desire to air the story.\n\"You realize they tried to kill us before?\" Walt said.\n\"I'm a reporter. I get the story. Don't worry about me, I'll carry my weight.\" She jumped up from the seat and grabbed\na small case that was on the floor by the desk. \"Let's get going. I don't want to hang around here too long.\"\nWalt rose from the chair. John stared at him, his mouth gaping open. \"You coming?\" Walt asked.\nHe regained his composure. \"What the hell. Besides,\" he added, looking around the room. \"I'll bet meteorites travel in bunches.\"\nShiela exited the office, with the others close behind. \"Can you give me a tee address?\" she asked.\n\"There's no way you'll get me in a tpod right now,\" Walt said. \"And the pods at matrix central are all locked. We'd better fly. The air car is on the roof.\"\nThey settled in for the flight. The air car only had two seats, so Shiela sat on the console between the two men. The men intermittently dozed, lulled by the soft drone of the blowers and the rushing air. Shiela spent the majority of the flight marveling at the vast world below her. Outside a blanket of darkness was covering the world, increasing the contrast of city lights and isolated homes.\nSince Walt and John both knew matrix central's coordinates, internal navigation flew the car. The flight was uneventful. For a brief period the hectic pace of the day had abated. Walt tried not to think of what lay ahead.\n\"You awake,\" Shiela asked.\n\"Yeah,\" Walt answered, though his eyes remained closed.\n\"This is something people don't see anymore.\" She gestured at the shadowy ground and the sun just touching the horizon. \"Tpods took that away.\"\n\"In a way, but they gave us much in return.\"\n\"I just wonder if the sacrifices have been worth it?\" she said.\n\"I don't know,\" Walt said and went back to sleep.\nWhen the arrival alarm sounded, it was pitch black outside. The chiming was all too similar to the matrix error alarm and jolted both men from their sleep. Walt cleared the alarm and took the controls. John began to scan the horizon for lights.\n\"Where are we?\" Shiela asked.\n\"We're approaching matrix central. We should see lights any moment now,\" Walt said.\n\"Maybe not,\" John said. \"Matrix central has no windows. It's just a big rectangular building. We may not be able to see it in the dark.\"\n\"Any suggestions?\" Walt asked.\n\"We could wait for morning,\" Shiela suggested.\n\"I'd rather not,\" Walt said. \"Navigation says we are approaching, but I don't see a thing. What about landing lights? For the air cars.\"\n\"The air car bays are on the south side,\" John said. \"We're east, or maybe north east, so they wouldn't show. You might try swinging to the south.\"\nWalt banked the car to the left until navigation reported they were south of the building. \"There we go.\" He pointed so the others would see the light green, flashing beacon for themselves.\n\"That would be the launch bay,\" John said. \"You want to go in there?\"\n\"I don't think so. We will need the surprise. I'm going to put down on the ground. We'll walk in.\"\n\"Can we get in from outside?\" Shiela asked.\n\"Sure,\" John said. \"There's recreational areas on the ground. Nothing's fenced that I know of.\"\n\"Will there be guards?\" she asked.\n\"I hope not,\" John answered.\n\"I doubt it,\" Walt added. \"Matrix central is real big. Something like a half million people work here. I'll bet there are several hundred exits. Security would be strapped to cover them all. Besides, all the tpods are locked and no one else has air cars but TP.\"\n\"And you,\" Shiela added.\n\"Yeah, and they'll know that. But this is the last place they would expect us to go.\"\n\"Let's hope so,\" John said.\nThey sat the air car down in a clearing several hundred meters from the building. A large rock pile, probably unearthed when the building was built, shielded the craft from view. \"They'll probably find this come daylight,\" Walt said as they began walking toward the building. \"We'd better hurry.\"\nThe quarter moon provided little illumination to walk by, slowing their travel. Occasionally one of them exclaimed softly as a toe was stubbed or balance lost. They saw each other only as outlines.\n\"Shame TP doesn't have a lighted night rec area,\" John whispered.\n\"They probably do, on the north side of the building,\" Walt replied. He touched the rough surface of a wall. \"Here we are. There should be an entrance pretty soon.\"\nIt was still several hundred meters before Walt whispered \"here's the door,\" and stopped so the others could catch up. \"Any last requests,\" he asked.\n\"Real funny,\" John said.\nWalt slowly turned the knob. When it reached its limit he pulled it open a crack and peered inside. The bright interior stung his eyes initially, but they quickly adjusted. The door ended a hallway that traveled as far as he could see. No one was in sight. He swung the door open and entered, with John and Shiela following close behind.\n\"It's a big operation,\" Walt whispered. \"Just act normal and no one will question us.\"\n\"What about IDs,\" John asked.\n\"I doubt if anyone will notice we're not wearing any. If it becomes a problem we'll just have to wing it.\"\nHe led them down the hall to the nearest elevator. \"We'll have to go to the service tech support level.\" He summoned the elevator, which promptly arrived with a light chime. Each of them looked around, as if to assure themselves the sound had gone unnoticed. They stepped in and Walt pressed the button labeled twenty two.\nWhen the door had closed he said \"Our best bet is to get an ID and go to one of the other tech supervisor's offices.\"\n\"How are you going to do that?\" Shiela asked.\n\"I'll bet our big friend here would love to vent some pent-up frustrations. Right, John?\"\n\"Damn straight!\" he answered.\nThe elevator opened, revealing the twenty second floor hallway, a twin of the first floor, but busier. Service techs, obvious in blue coveralls, mulled around in the hall and a low din of conversation could be heard. Vague mechanical sounds emanated from repair shops on\nthe floor. With Walt in the lead, they stepped from the elevator and headed to the right. The techs appeared undisturbed in their conversation.\nAt a random door Walt stopped. The name Eric Garver was etched into the metal door panel. A lighted, blue button by the door signaled Eric's presence and availability. \"Let's make it quick,\" Walt whispered. He pressed the button and the door slid open.\n\"May I help you?\" the man said as they stepped into the room. He peered up at them through unfashionable wire rim glasses that perched on an excessive nose. He sat, with his hands frozen on the terminal keyboard, awaiting an answer.\nShiela was the last in the door. She pressed the close and lock buttons behind her. As the door slid closed, John and Walt collided as each began a clumsy pounce. Walt jumped out of the way and allowed John to grab the man behind the desk. Papers flew off the desk in the struggle as John subdued the man's arms with one hand and prevented him from screaming with the other. When the pandemonium had settled, he had the man in a bear hug. \"Now what do we do with him?\" he asked.\nWalt glanced around the spartan office. \"We need to subdue him,\" he stated, \"but I don't see anything.\"\nShiela was rummaging in her case, and pulled out a piece of wire. \"Try this. It's a tri-V power cord. I'll record on batteries, anyway.\"\nJohn grabbed the wire and started tying Garver up. \"Just keep quite and you won't get hurt,\" he said before removing his hand. \"We need something for his mouth.\"\n\"Use his belt,\" Walt said.\n\"Right,\" John replied. He stripped the man's belt and used it as a makeshift gag. When the man was secure, he pulled his ID and handed it to Walt. \"Here you go.\"\nWalt sat down at the desk. He didn't really need the ID, since the terminal was still logged on. He cleared the previous activity and then tried to decide what best to do.\n\"Could you reproduce those stats you showed me?\" Shiela asked, leaning over the desk.\n\"I could, but that would probably alert the sysop again. What about the high rate sites?\" he asked.\n\"Let's start there. You need these?\" She held out the prints he had given her earlier.\n\"Yeah.\" He selected site history for each of the four locations. The screen displayed the locations and the recent error logs. \"There you go.\"\n\"You're right,\" she said. \"Why would they make some locations do that?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Walt said.\n\"Could we go there and check it out?\" she asked.\n\"No way. Those locations are type six industrial pods, no interconnect to type three pods. There's a service pod listed, but it's locked.\" He pointed at a key icon next to the entry on the screen.\n\"Enter code 43W,\" John said.\nWalt entered the code and the key icon disappeared. \"I didn't know you could override a lock remotely,\" he said.\n\"They had a bad run of locks. They gave us the override codes to simplify getting to the sites and replacing the lock card. I can override most local safeguards.\"\n\"Could you detonate a site?\" Shiela asked.\n\"Before yesterday, I never would have believed that was possible, but I don't think so. Doc said that takes simultaneous transmit and receive. I've never heard of a code to override mode separation.\"\n\"I would think it would be tough,\" Walt said. \"Maybe that's why they missed us. It took too long to set up.\"\n\"Can we get to the site now?\" Shiela asked again.\n\"Sure, by tpod,\" Walt said, brandishing the pilfered ID. \"I doubt if anyone suspects our Mr. Garver.\"\n\"Will we all three fit in a pod?\"\n\"I'd better stay here and monitor you,\" John volunteered. \"I would rather not go exploring right now, anyway.\"\nWalt clipped the ID on. \"Ok, you stay. If we are very long, get to another office. You might try to call GTV if the phone system's not monitored.\"\n\"Give them my name and tell them what is going on,\" Shiela added. \"I don't know what they could do, but the more people who know, the better.\"\n\"Ok,\" John said. \"Get going. I'll watch from here.\"\nWalt and Shiela left the room. Looking back as they walked down the hall, Walt noticed John had re-locked the door.\n\"You think the tpod will be safe?\" Shiela asked.\n\"I hope so. As safe as usual, at least.\" They reached the pod at the end of the hall, and stepped in together. He entered the address for one of the sites and activated the transporter with the stolen ID. The scene through the door view port changed to a high ceiling room full of plumbing and machinery.\n\"Where are we?\" Shiela asked. Her voice echoed over the sound of a roaring exhaust fan.\n\"Looks like a small factory.\" Walt sniffed at the air. There was a distinct ozone smell to the room, intermingled with lubricants and solvents. There was something else, also. \"Do you smell salt?\"\n\"I sure do. Do you think we're by the sea?\"\n\"Smells like it. The ocean has a definite smell to it.\" He walked farther into the room. \"What is all this?\"\n\"You're asking me? Where's that pod?\"\n\"I think that's it over there.\" He led her over to a large box painted the same utility gray as all the other equipment in the room. \"Industrial unit. Here's the control panel.\" He pointed to a panel mounted on the side of the unit. It was covered with gauges and indicators and had a screen indicating standby status.\nSuddenly a large motor started. It groaned before catching hold, then accelerated to a steady speed. Momentarily startled, Walt walked over to the pod chamber and wiped dust from the view port. \"It's filling with water,\" he said.\n\"Sea water?\" she asked, walking over to look for herself. He noticed that she had taken out the compact tri-V recorder and was filming.\n\"I guess so. It doesn't look very clean.\" The pump stopped. Walt suspected that the chamber was full. Then the chamber was empty. \"It activated.\"\n\"Who would transport sea water?\" Shiela asked. \"Space use?\"\n\"Not sea water,\" Walt said. He walked over to the control panel. The red indicator confirmed his suspicion. \"And that water didn't go anywhere. It got tixed. This site has a 100% error rate, remem\nber?\"\n\"But why tix water.\"\n\"Energy,\" Walt realized. \"They're adding energy to the system. Do you know where our energy comes from?\"\n\"I know it's a by-product of the tpod system. TP Technologies produces all the power.\"\n\"When something gets tixed,\" Walt said, \"it's converted directly to energy in the D-dimension. TP taps that energy. But you can't tap energy that isn't there. There must not be enough energy in the system to meet demand, so they created these plants to add energy to the system. A few hundred liters of sea water is a lot of energy.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" Shiela said. \"But what does that have to do with the odds changing on human transportation?\"\n\"I don't know, but this does prove that matrix errors can be controlled.\"\n\"We had a matrix error in the office last week,\" Shiela said. \"They sent someone out to service the pod. Will someone be coming to service this one?\" She looked apprehensive.\n\"A tix blows the transmit D-wave synchronizer. It has to be replaced. Look!\" He pointed at a small robot arm attached to the pod mechanism. It removed an access panel and pulled the burnt transmit synchronizer from the opening. Discarding it on one conveyer belt it reached to another and picked up a new unit, which it promptly installed, closing the hatch behind it. \"It's automatic,\" Walt said.\n\"Don't move,\" said a husky voice from behind them. \"Put your hands on your heads and turn around slowly.\"\nObeying, they turned to face a tall man in a dark red uniform with a handgun. He had a lopsided scowl and needed a shave. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked.\nWalt and Shiela just stood there. \"Who are you?\" the man asked.\nWhen they still did not reply, the guard led them to the service tpod and told them not to move as he phoned for instructions. \"What are they going to do to us?\" Shiela whispered as the guard discussed the situation on the phone.\n\"What do you think?\" Walt replied, nodding at the waiting tpod.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the guard said and hung up the phone. He hit the open button. \"Into the pod. Both of you!\"\n\"We've all gotta go sometime,\" Walt said as he stepped in. Shiela hesitated, and was violently shoved in by the guard.\n\"Yeah,\" Shiela said, \"I guess so.\" The guard reached in and entered an address. As the door closed, Walt wondered if the guard knew what was going to happen to them.\nThe scene through the view port was replaced by a room containing a desk, another guard, and a well dressed executive type. The guard stood watch in the corner of the room. The other man was sitting behind a large desk sparsely populated by a few folders, a telephone, and a computer terminal.\nThe pod opened and Walt and Shiela stepped into the room. The man behind the desk stood up when he recognized them.\n\"It's you,\" he exclaimed. \"We've been searching matrix central. How the hell did you get to Orlando?\"\nWalt looked at Shiela, then turned back to the man and shrugged his shoulders.\nHe picked up the phone and dialed. \"Hart in Central here. Donly and the reporter are here. We picked them up in the Orlando facility. Yes. Beach must still be in the building. Good.\" He hung up the phone.\n\"Where's John Beach?\" His pause brought no reply. \"Ok, you guys. I think there are some things you need to know. We've been tracking you since yesterday. I think you realize the magnitude of what you've stumbled onto. Surely you realize that we are not going to let you broadcast it to the world. We are prepared, however, to make arrangements for you that could be quite comfortable.\"\n\"We've seen your arrangements,\" Walt said.\n\"Yes, you have. But if you are willing to work with us, there is no reason why you should be in danger. We are not vicious killers.\"\n\"Twenty million a year?\" Shiela asked.\n\"That's not your concern. I want you to tell me were John Beach is. Then if you will help us analyze the weaknesses in our security system, your help will not go un-rewarded.\"\n\"We split up,\" Shiela injected. \"I don't know where he is now.\"\n\"Was he in matrix central when you split up?\"\n\"No,\" Shiela replied. \"He decided to take off into the woods when we got there, figuring he would be safer.\"\nHart slammed his palm down on the desk. \"Bullshit,\" he yelled. \"You think this is a game? Do you want me to get Mike here to beat the crap out of both of you? He'd like to.\" The big guard smiled. \"I need answers, and I need them now. Where's Beach?\"\nWalt looked at the man and drew up his best movie scowl. Perhaps it would be better to go for the guard, rather than awaiting fate. He judged the distance and tried to estimate Shiela's reaction. A quick pounce would be unexpected, and might catch him by surprise. If only he could get that gun.\nWalt was bracing himself for the useless jump when the phone rang. \"Yes,\" Hart answered. A startled look replaced the anger on his face. \"Where are you?\" he asked, then \"I can't do that.\"\nThe blast knocked everyone down. Walt grabbed his ears. They were ringing so loudly that he could barely hear. \"What was that?\" he heard Shiela yell. She, too, was gripping her head. Hart was on the floor, the phone dangling by his side. The guard had dropped his gun and was scrambling to grab it. Walt leaped for it, but was too late. The guard was up and had them both covered again.\nHart slowly rose. He picked up the phone again. \"Ok, but you won't get far,\" he said. \"Get into the pod,\" he said to Walt and Shiela. As soon as they were inside, he said \"They're in.\" The door slid shut and the unit activated. Walt noted that no address had been entered.\nThey stepped out into another hallway. John was running toward them. \"You OK?\" he asked.\n\"Yeah,\" Walt said. \"And you better keep it down. Where are we? And what happened?\"\n\"You're four floors above service tech support,\" John said as he gestured for them to follow. He was moving quickly. \"We had better get out of here, quick. It won't take long for them to trace that transport. I was monitoring you and noticed a tee to your location from matrix central followed by another tee back. I figured you guys got caught. The termi\nnal gave me a service phone for the pod you teed to, so I called it. The guy who answered obviously had you, so I threatened him.\"\n\"But what was that blast,\" Shiela asked.\n\"An old maintenance trick. If the door close mechanism fails, you can't tee to a site to repair it. That means travel by air car in some cases. Recently, they gave us a door fail-safe override. Now we can tee in with the door open.\"\n\"But you didn't tee in,\" Walt said.\n\"No, I just activated a tee from the first empty pod I found. Directed it all from the terminal. You tee anything, including air, into an un-evacuated pod, and the air sitting in the pod already is displaced, like real fast. About a nanosecond, if I remember right. Makes a hell of a sound.\"\n\"I'll be damned,\" Walt said. \"We had better find another office and hide. They may trace the terminal that ordered the pod activation.\"\n\"Good idea,\" John said. They entered an elevator. John slid his hand down every selector in the elevator, telling the elevator to stop at every floor. \"That'll make us harder to trace.\" When they reached tech support they got out and went to another office, commandeering it as they had done previously.\n\"Now what do we do,\" Shiela asked.\n\"I think we ought to get back to GTV,\" John said. \"Do you have enough dope to nail this mess?\"\n\"Yes. Can we get out of here now?\" she replied.\n\"I don't think that's a good idea,\" Walt said. \"If they can tix twenty million people a year, how big a deal would nuking a few hundred thousand in New York be. They may be monitoring for any pod traffic to GTV.\"\n\"I could just call it in,\" Shiela said.\n\"I bet not. They're probably monitoring all outgoing lines. Calling would just give our position away.\"\n\"Well, do you have any ideas?\" John asked.\n\"I think we should try to put a stop to this,\" Walt said.\n\"Releasing a news story should do that,\" Shiela said.\n\"Do you really think we can get a story like this out of this building? Do you want to bet on whether the phone lines are tapped? We need leverage.\"\n\"What kind of leverage?\" John asked.\nWalt thought. He saw no immediate escape from their dilemma. The control of matrix errors went very high, probably to Julius Bartholemew, the executive board of TP, or higher. And the controllers possessed the equivalent of nuclear weapons. They could risk it and go to GTV, but the chances of the story getting on the air had to be slim. \"Where would the matrix errors be controlled from?\" he wondered out loud.\n\"It could be anywhere,\" John said. \"All it would take would be a terminal with special access codes.\"\n\"But a terminal would have to go through building switching, wouldn't it?\"\n\"I don't know. I've never worked with terminals other than the service ports.\"\n\"Would a terminal be secure enough to control this?\" Shiela asked.\n\"I guess so,\" Walt said. \"Of course, any activity can be monitored at the matrix computer main system console. That's how they caught me meddling with the matrix error records. Even if we found the right terminal, the sysop would catch us.\"\n\"It seems,\" John said, \"like the system console would be the ideal location for controlling the error rate.\"\n\"You're right,\" Walt said. \"Even if there are other terminals, all system functions are available from the system console.\"\n\"Where is it?\" Shiela asked.\n\"It's adjacent to the the matrix computer,\" Walt said. \"That's the basement if I remember right.\"\n\"Yeah,\" John added. \"They showed us the system during orientation. Just a bunch of racks and the system console. I don't remember anyone else being on the floor at the time.\"\n\"Can we get to it,\" Shiela asked.\n\"It should be heavily protected,\" Walt said. \"Let's see if we can tee in.\" He activated the terminal, using their latest host's ID to log in. \"I don't see any pods on that floor,\" he said after a moment of perusing records.\n\"There has to be,\" John said. \"That's how we got to the floor during the tour.\"\n\"Well I don't see anything listed,\" Walt said. \"That would be one way of securing the floor from unauthorized personnel. Either way, we can't tee in.\"\n\"What about elevators,\" Shiela asked.\n\"I didn't see any floors below one in the elevators,\" Walt said. \"You hit all of them, John. Did you see any?\"\n\"No, I didn't. I doubt if the elevator goes down there. If it did, they wouldn't have teed us in.\"\n\"True,\" Walt said. \"No elevator and unlisted tpods. The only thing left would be stairs. I wonder if they go to that level?\"\n\"Only one way to find out,\" John said.\nThey left the office and walked to the end of the hall. A door panel with a graphic step icon opened to allow them in the stairwell. They began down.\n\"How far,\" asked Shiela.\n\"We're on twenty two,\" John said. \"Figure that many flights.\"\nSpiraling downward toward the basement, they eventually reached the end of the stairs and faced a blank, red, door panel.\n\"How do we open it?\" asked John.\n\"I don't see an access pad,\" Walt said. \"All the rest of the floors had access pads. This must be exit only. No way in.\"\n\"I've got tools in my kit,\" Shiela said. \"Could we break in?\"\n\"I doubt it,\" said John. \"I don't see any panels or hinges we could remove, and the door's sealed.\"\n\"I don't think we can get in from here,\" Walt said. \"Let's go up a level and see if we can find another way down.\" He started back up the stairs with the others following.\nThe next level had a normal access pad. He pressed it and the door opened to a huge room filled with the sound of buzzing fans. \"Looks like computer equipment on this floor also,\" he said.\n\"They distinctly said in the tour that the matrix computer is all contained on the bottom floor. Of course, that was several years ago. Maybe they expanded.\"\n\"Or this may be support equipment,\" Walt said. \"Input\/output gear and tpod links.\" He looked at the large, featureless racks. Each had a plate with the words \"TP Technologies, Inc.\" and a seven digit model number. \"Probably link equipment,\" he ventured. \"TP buys its computers.\"\n\"Is all this equipment connected to\ntpods?\" Shiela asked. She had activated the tri-V recorder again.\n\"It probably connects tpods to the matrix computer,\" Walt said. He looked down. \"I'll bet this floor has a maze of wiring under it.\"\nJohn glanced down at the white floor tiles. \"False floor?\" he asked.\n\"It looks like computer flooring,\" Walt said. \"The tiles lift out to allow easy access to the wires. I don't see any overhead cabling, so it must be under the floor.\" Suddenly he saw what John was getting at. \"And that cabling probably goes to the main computer. There may be an access-way.\"\nJohn and Walt began examining the floor for a way to get under it as Shiela continued recording. \"How do they get the tiles up?\" John asked.\n\"There's a special handle with two suction cups on it. I've see it done. It's a common item, so there may be one lying around somewhere.\"\nThey all began to search for the floor tool. After a few minutes of searching behind and over racks, Shiela pointed at the top of a rack. \"Is that one?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Walt said, grabbing the tool. He set it on one of the floor tiles and lifted. The tool lifted. The tile remained seated.\n\"Press the lever,\" John said.\nWalt noticed the lever on the top of the tool and, placing the tool back in place, he activated it. This time the tile lifted. It was much heavier than he expected, so it was a struggle to get it out of the hole. \"Got it,\" he said at last.\nThey stared into the cavity. A spider web of wire confronted them, some loose, some bundled into tied groups. There seemed no general direction to the wires; they went in all directions simultaneously. \"Let's go,\" Walt said climbing into the meter and a half crawl space under the floor. Crouching down, he found he could move over the wire fairly easily. Shiela followed him down, with John bringing up the rear. John had removed the floor tool and tossed it into the hole. As he entered he pulled the loose tile back into place.\nThe only light under the floor was tiny slivers around the edges of the tiles. Shiela pulled a portable light source from her bag and activated it. White light streamed in all directions. \"That should help,\" she said, handing the light to Walt.\n\"God, I'm glad you came equipped,\" Walt said. \"You always carry a flashlight?\"\n\"Ever tried to tape a news spot in the dark?\" Shiela replied. \"Your basic black doesn't sell.\"\n\"Right,\" Walt said. He looked around for order in the chaos. \"Any ideas as to where to go?\"\n\"We might try following the wall,\" John suggested and they proceeded toward the nearest one. Travel in the under-floor maze was slow, but steadying. Occasionally they had to climb over a large bundle of wire, but most of the cabling was only a few layers deep.\nThey traveled until they reached the end of the floor, then turned left. There was an area devoid of cabling next to the wall that made movement easier, and they stayed in that area.\n\"I think we're getting somewhere,\" Walt said. \"Notice that the cable bundles parallel to the wall are getting larger. We may be approaching a feed-through of some kind.\"\n\"How far?\" Shiela asked.\n\"I don't have any idea. But the wire bundles can only get so big before they become...\" He stopped moving and doused the light. \"Hear that?\" he said.\n\"What?\" whispered Shiela.\n\"Footsteps.\" In the distance steps could be heard on the floor. Suddenly they heard a striking sound and the darkness was broken far ahead of them. The square opening became a searchlight as a beacon was lowered into the floor space and rotated around, casting light in all directions before retracting back above. The tile was replaced and the footsteps began again.\n\"They're searching under the floor,\" John said.\n\"And they appear to be heading this...\" Walt stopped as another tile lifted, only closer. \"Under the wire,\" he said when the tile was replaced.\nEach of them scrambled to lift a wiring bundle and shimmy under it. The wire was not heavy, but was dense. They had just managed to find hiding places when the next tile lifted. They froze as the searchers drew nearer. At one point they were less than ten meters away. Then they were behind, continuing the search.\n\"We'll stay low until they clear the floor,\" Walt said. The searchers were near the corner where they had entered. They reached the wall and began a cycle back, this time closer to the center of the room. They obviously intended to sweep the entire floor area. \"We should be safe. They've already passed us, but they might see movement.\" They relaxed where they were and waited for the search to end.\nIt was several hours before the searchers left for another floor. \"Let's go,\" Walt said as he untangled himself. John was quickly behind him, but Shiela was caught. It took several minutes for the two of them to free her, then they began to move again.\nFollowing the growing cable bundle, they soon reached a hole in the floor. It went down about four meters and had wire on all four sides lashed to rungs, giving the appearance of a hollow, square ladder. The access way had plenty of room for climbing and the rungs made ready steps. They climbed into the basement.\n\"That was easy,\" John said.\n\"Yeah. We're on the matrix computer floor now,\" Walt said, \"or rather under the floor.\" They were again in an under-floor crawl space, but the cabling was far more organized. It was tied carefully in bundles that only ran in two directions. \"Looks like TP hired someone to do this job,\" he added. \"Any ideas where the master console is?\"\n\"I remember it being in a corner,\" John said. \"I don't think this level is partitioned, so if we follow the wall we should find it sooner or later. We can always lift tiles and look.\"\nWalt tried this. First he lifted a tile just a crack and looked for guards. Not seeing any, he lifted it higher. Aside from rows and rows of blue cabinets the floor was empty. The aisle they were under stretched as far as he could see.\n\"This floor looks deserted. We could get out and walk,\" John said.\n\"There might be motion alarms,\" Walt said. \"Let's stick under here for now.\"\n\"I'd feel a lot safer under the floor,\" Shiela added.\nThey began to move along the wall. With the exception of occasional feeds from the higher floor, the basement had\nthe same characteristic of a cleared space near the wall, which made for easy travel. Walt did find himself wishing he could stand. The constant crouch had become tiring.\nThey traveled for hours. Walt remembered reading that the dimensions of the building were expressed in kilometers. It would take a while to go from corner to corner on hands and knees, and then the master console could still be elsewhere. He became aware that it had been over 24 hours since he had last eaten. At least he had gotten some sleep in the air car.\n\"Hold it,\" he said, holding up his palm. In the distance he saw a wall in front of him. They had reached the first corner. He lifted a tile to see.\nLowering his head back into the floor he whispered, \"Got it.\" He looked again to determine what best to do. Shiela slipped up next to him and looked out also.\n\"Good God,\" she said. \"That's Julius Bartholemew.\"\n\"Chairman of the board of TP,\" Walt said. \"I guess that tells how high this goes.\"\n\"Yeah. Do you recognize the other two?\"\n\"No. One appears to be a system operator, but he must be in on this. He would see everything. The other guy is just a guard.\"\n\"What do you see,\" John asked from below. Walt slipped down and told him. Then John lifted up for his own look.\n\"We've got to get rid of the guard,\" John said. \"I think we can take him.\"\n\"He's got a gun,\" Shiela said.\nWalt was counting floor tiles. \"But we've got surprise,\" he said. Once he knew the distance to the guard he lowered the tile back into place and began moving toward the console.\n\"Here?\" John whispered, pointing up at a floor tile.\n\"If I counted right,\" Walt replied. \"Let's go for it.\"\nIn a single action, the two men pushed up on the tile with all their might. The tile went one way and the guard the other. He dropped the gun and Shiela grabbed it. She turned and covered Julius and the operator while Walt and John subdued the guard. \"Don't touch that,\" she yelled as the operator reached for his console. He pulled his hands back as she fired the gun past his ear.\nUpon hearing the shot, the guard quit struggling and Walt and John quickly gained control of him. In a moment the three captives were lined up against the wall. Shiela gave John the gun. He looked at it a moment then aimed it at the hostages.\nWalt had jumped into the master console chair and was typing request sequences on the keyboard. \"Good,\" he said. \"It works just like my office console; it just has more commands available. I've locked all the pod's on this floor--there are twenty.\" He continued typing. \"There was a phone lock and trace on GTV. I've killed that, Shiela. You can use the phone.\" He motioned to the phone on the desk. Shiela ran over and grabbed it.\n\"You don't know what you're doing,\" said Julius Bartholemew.\n\"Keep quiet,\" John said, motioning with the gun.\n\"No, let him speak,\" Shiela said, setting the phone down. \"I want to know what's going on here.\"\n\"I'm sure you know by now that we can manipulate the matrix error rate,\" he said.\n\"But that's supposed to be impossible,\" Walt said. \"It's a violation of the laws of physics.\"\n\"We didn't know all the laws,\" the operator said.\n\"Who are you,\" Shiela asked.\n\"I'm Dr. Howard Drake, director of research for TP. I discovered the missing term in the D-wave equation. With it I can predict and, therefore, control matrix errors.\"\n\"If you can do that, why didn't you just stop them? You would have been global heroes,\" Walt said. \"Why continue to murder innocent people at a massive rate if it can be prevented?\"\n\"It's not that easy,\" Julius said. \"You know where our energy comes from.\"\n\"Of course I do,\" Walt said.\n\"So what would happen if we stopped matrix errors? There'd be no power. We couldn't shut down the world power grid.\"\n\"So just shove mass in and convert it,\" Walt said. \"You seem to be doing that already.\"\n\"We are now, but the amount of mass needed is a lot more than can be quickly tossed in. We had to build facilities like the one in Orlando to add energy to the system. It took several years to get a sufficient base of those built that we could shut down the matrix errors.\"\n\"But you did build them,\" Walt said. \"And I know you are using them.\"\n\"We are. It seems that no matter how much energy we supply, the world requires more. We have been tapering supply down, but it takes time.\"\n\"That's a pretty lame excuse for killing millions a year,\" Shiela said. \"You can make enough energy with the sea water plants, I'm sure. Just build more plants.\"\n\"There are other complexities,\" Julius said. \"When we got the plants operational, we did start cutting the tix rate. We could not do it quickly, since the plants only came on line one at a time. So, we manipulated the odds. It gradually became safer and safer to travel via transporter.\"\n\"I'm seeing worse odds, not better,\" Walt said.\n\"We had to turn it back up again. Do you know the present population of the world?\"\n\"About 500 million,\" Shiela said.\n\"Right, but before tpods came into general use, the population was around two and half billion. People accept the odds as a part of life. Because of those odds and the amount people use the pods, the average person lives 35 years before the odds catch up with him. The life span used to average over ninety.\"\n\"You're worried about population growth,\" Walt said.\n\"Right. With medical science as advanced as it is now, the life span would be over two hundred. That tpod error statistic has become the only stabilizing factor in our population. We cut it back and the population began to climb, rapidly. In four years it was obvious that the growth could not be controlled. We had to offset what we had done to regain a balance.\"\n\"A balance,\" Walt yelled. \"This is not a ledger sheet. People die in matrix errors. Who gave you the right to decide?\"\n\"You don't rise to my level waiting for someone to let you make decisions,\"\nJulius said. \"If our population runs back up over a billion, people will be starving. We live in an idyllic world, with a young, healthy population. Do you want to see that ruined?\"\n\"The population controlled itself before tpods,\" Shiela said.\n\"No it didn't.

Ryan Barris chuckled as he took his wife's coat.\n``The usual,'' she replied, removing her mittens and scarf. ``Just a bunch of rocks. No, there was one with some life, but nothing more than a bunch of naked nomads running around kowtowing to the local gods.''\nRyan chuckled again. ``They'll make good slaves for someone.'' He closed the closet door. ``Did you talk to Dyerson about a raise?''\n``Yes,'' Amanda answered, walking into the living room and settling into a TV chair. ``He said he can't give pay increases to upper management with the unions breathing down his neck. The bastard told me to go on an acquisition! What nerve, telling a vice-president to go sit in a spaceship for three weeks!'' Ryan sat down on the couch and faced her. ``So do you want to go?''\nAmanda rubbed her temples. ``I don't know. I mean, you know how I feel about the whole thing; I hate being cooped up like that, and I can't stand going through interspace. But it would mean getting the house... I need more time to think about it.'' ``I think you should do it. I mean, the mission is three weeks. The house is for life, and there'd be enough room to buy some kids if we wanted.''\nAmanda leapt out of her chair and onto the couch. ``You trying to get rid of me?'' she asked, tickling Ryan in the gut. He reciprocated, and if they had been living a hundred years earlier, the rest of the evening would have saved them the price of a grade-A infant.\n``Okay, ma'am, sign at the bottom.'' The clerk pushed some papers toward Amanda. It was a standard release form; she had helped to write its predecessor several years earlier. Nothing too unusual, just the obligatory waiving of medical liabilities and so forth. She skimed the text out of habit, signed and dated the last page, and handed it back to the clerk. ``All right, ma'am, everything looks okay,'' the clerk said. He obviously wasn't accustomed to dealing with people of her rank. It showed on his face and in his voice. He would be manning this desk for quite some time.\nAmanda stood and walked out of the room, heading toward personnel transport. She wanted to get the whole business behind her as quickly as possible. The acquisition team would already be prepping for the mission, and they would be waiting for her by the time she got to the station. The sooner she was on her way, the better.\nPersonnel transport had her airborne within fifteen minutes; rank had its privileges. The plane docked with a transatmospheric shuttle a half-hour later, and she was on her way up to Lagrange point three.\nHer haste had paid off: the acquisition team was still in briefing when she arrived. Luckily, Amanda had personally approved the takeover of the target planet, so she was already well acquainted with the relevant details. She was waiting on the carrier's bridge when they arrived. The first one onto the bridge was a rugged dark-haired man in his late fifties. He introduced himself as John Gately, the mission commander. Amanda was just shaking his hand when a bald woman entered. Her hands trembled slightly, and her eyes were extremely bloodshot; she was clearly a deadhead. Still, as long as it didn't interfere with the mission, it was her business. Amanda greeted her and learned that she was Tricia Morris, Gately's second-in-command. Gately and Morris silently checked all the flight systems.\nThe three were strapping themselves in for takeoff when a palefaced young man hurried in, apologizing to John for his tardiness. John introduced him as Mark Ashton, the technical advisor. Mark slid into the flight seat behind Amanda and buckled himself in.\nTricia flipped a switch on a panel in front of her. A few indicator lights came on. ``Crew ready,'' she said in the raspy voice typical of deadheads.\nGately pressed a button and a keyboard slid out from somewhere in the control panel. He typed a short command. A computer voice spoke: ``Prepare for acceleration. Interspace drive will activate thirty-two minutes after launch.'' Amanda shuddered at the thought of entering interspace again. Such terrible sensations. But it would only last a few minutes; the planet was only three hundred lightyears away. The floor started to vibrate. There was a roar from the back of the ship, and Amanda was pushed back into her seat. The acceleration was only about thirty gees, but even this close to the front of the ship, the dampers didn't compensate fully. The team, in a room behind the bridge, were getting much worse treatment. Amanda wished that they had put a fourth damper on the ship, so she could sit in total comfort while accelerating. But the cost was just too prohibitive.\nThe acceleration continued for a nearly intolerable thirty minutes. Then, abruptly, it ceased. The computer's voice came on again: ``Interspace precharge in progress. Entry in two minutes.''\n``Hate interspace,'' said Tricia. ``Worse than bad patch.'' John grunted agreement. Amanda remained silent; there was no point in demonstrating weakness unnecessarily. After a moment, a high-pitched whine filled the room, and silent, cold darkness descended upon the bridge.\nAmanda couldn't feel herself breathe, or hear the pound of a heartbeat in her eardrums. And soon... yes, there. It was a sort of wail, the parts of it that could be heard. In sight it manifested as millions of tiny points of light, dancing around in random patterns. Amanda's entire body tingled as her foot did when it fell asleep. A metallic taste assaulted her mouth, and a sickly sweet odor filled her nostrils. And the worst thing: unintelligible utterances, whispers with no sound, filled her mind. This was what the interspace pilots called ``the song of the stars,'' a misnomer which was perpetuated to great profit by the Star-pilots' Academy.\nIt was over almost before it started. The odd sensations diminished, and sight and sound returned. Amanda looked at the other command crewmembers; the little she could see from her seat was reassuring. It would have been very inconvenient to lose one of them to the songs, always a possibility on the even the most routine of missions.\nTricia flipped her comm switch again. ``Status?'' A male voice answered. ``One babbler, a shuttle mechanic. He was a redundant anyway, so we're fine. We're flushing him now.'' That would be that much less mass on the ship, not that it made any significant difference. Amanda heard someone blathering in the background; then a hatch closed and the voice was cut off. John looked at a couple of screens. ``We're almost there. The computer says we'll be in orbit in twenty minutes. Acceleration is only twelve gees, so you can all get up.'' This was purely for Amanda's benefit; everyone else had been through all of this hundreds of times before.\nAmanda opened up all the straps and stood, stretching. Though the scientists insisted it wasn't a physical effect, interspace always left her feeling about an inch shorter than usual. She had little faith in their proclamations; they hadn't invented the drive and didn't really know how it worked. She walked over to a display and called up a scan of the planet. She knew all the information that appeared on the screen, but it never hurt to refresh one's memory. Amanda didn't believe that this would take the full three weeks, unless the anomaly in the southern hemisphere turned out to be interesting. The anomaly was a region of unusually high radiation levels. They would send a probe down to investigate before landing any people nearby, of course; no sense wasting employees when it wasn't necessary.\nShe instructed Mark to have a probe prepared. He hurried off the bridge to do her bidding.\n``Why you?'' asked Tricia. ``Vice presidents usually stay Earth.''\n``Money,'' replied Amanda. ``My husband and I want to have children, but they don't come cheaply.'' ``Try Ceres. Grade-B for half price.'' ``Second-rate bootleg babies? After this, we'll be able to afford grade-AA, or maybe even AAA,'' Amanda said. ``We don't want to settle for anything less than the best.'' ``System feeds itself,'' Tricia muttered, and walked off. Amanda shrugged. She saw nothing wrong. The rich could afford the best children, and the money stayed in the family because those children were capable of managing it. That was life.\nAmanda skimmed the crew's records. She was surprised to note that Tricia had been a guard with the Beta Cassoni acquisition team; she was lucky to be alive after that disaster. There were no other people of note in the crew, just the usual set of B-types.\n``Orbital insertion in two minutes,'' declared the computer. ``All shuttle and onboard systems are functional.'' Mark returned. ``The probe's ready,'' he said. ``Of course, we'll get a good look at the area before we land anyway. Our orbit will bring us right over it, and I'll be sitting at the scan station the whole time.''\n``Good,'' said Amanda. ``Let me know if you have something interesting. I'll be in my quarters.'' She left the bridge and headed aft. Most of the acquisition team was still in the acceleration room, standing around talking. Nobody noticed Amanda passing by. She arrived at her quarters, which consisted of a spartan bedroom, food dispenser, and an alcove that masqueraded as a washroom. She noticed that someone had secured her suitcase to a wall; she had accidentally left it on the bed, and it would have flown across the room as they left L-3. She cursed herself for being so careless; at least one of the teammembers knew she was a landlubber. Amanda sat down on the side of the bed and rubbed her eyes. This wasn't all that bad. She was already here, anyway, with another interspace voyage under her belt and only one more left in her life, she hoped. She decided to lie down for a few minutes, and was ashamed to be awakened by Ashton's voice. ``...of some sort of alien spacecraft,'' he was saying. ``The survey report is pretty much on target; the planet has all sorts of rare minerals. The locals should be easy to round up. They're pretty primitive. They're spread out over all the big continents in little tribes. The tribes are all centered around brown things that are scattered all over the planet. My guess is they're some sort of religious idols or something. They might be worth a bit in the alien art circuit, so if you give the go-ahead, we'll take as many of them as we can fit in the cargo hold.''\n``Yes, that's fine. Anything else?'' ``Well, only that the tribes and idols seem to be concentrated more heavily around the crash site than the rest of the planet. The anthropologist says that was probably because they saw the thing come falling out of the sky. Don't remember her technical name for it.''\n``Very good, Ashton.'' Amanda got out of bed. She was going to have to go down on one of the shuttles, of course; that was part of her job here. Someone had to keep tabs on these operations. Usually it was some low management gofer, someone who wouldn't be missed if the whole mission was swallowed by a black hole or lost in interspace. A vice-president turned a few heads. The team would be watching her, though they might not let it show. She would make sure things went smoothly. IAC was certainly paying enough; the pay bonus for a VP was as astronomical as the destination. But most upper management lived comfortably enough that they didn't want to go so far out of their ways to make more money.\nShe walked into the acceleration room, where John was going over the exact acquisition plans with a few teammates. The first shuttle was to be launched in an hour; it would set down almost exactly opposite the planet from the alien ship, where there were very few tribes. If they were rounded up without difficulty, more shuttles would repeat the process all over the globe. A small science team was set to go down to the crash site in a little over two hours; there were occasionally some good devices to be found in the rubble and reverse engineered. The interspace drive was a prime example.\nAmanda asked to be placed on the first shuttle; best to get this out of the way as soon as possible. Gately already had her on the crew list; she wasn't sure that she liked that. Tricia was on the shuttle as well.\nAmanda went back to her room and changed clothes. The delicate silks and arborites she had on now would get ruined if she had to go out onto the surface for some reason. Instead she opted for a utility suit, with all sorts of pockets, thermal control, and buoyancy bubbles. The planet had slightly stronger gravity than Earth normal, and the bubbles would make standing up a lot easier. It was an impulse buy that had cost her a small fraction of the bonus she'd get for going on this mission, but that was still more than most people made in a year. She put on the suit (not a trivial task, as she soon found out; it stuck to the ceiling as soon as she had removed the lead weights, and she had to turn off the room gravity to get into it) and put the weights back into her suitcase. It was time to go already, so she headed for the shuttle bay. The bay was huge, large enough for the ship's compliment of twenty-five big cargo shuttles. Its ceiling had a matrix of holes, each the same size as a shuttle landing platform. At the top of each hole was a foot-thick sliding airlock door, beyond which was the vacuum of space. Tricia was waiting outside one of the shuttles. ``Ready?'' she asked as Amanda approached. Amanda nodded, and they proceeded inside. The two of them sat in the cockpit, really a formality since the entire flight would be computer-controlled. As soon as the seals were airtight, the shuttle lurched upward, carried by its platform. The shuttle entered its ceiling hole, and continued a couple of yards. When the platform had completely sealed the hole, the air was removed and the airlock door opened to reveal the planet hanging above them in the sky. Amanda felt dizzy for a moment; seeing a planet thousands of kilometers above her head wasn't something she was used to. She closed her eyes briefly, then looked down into her lap.\nTricia laughed. ``I did same, first few times.'' The shuttle lifted itself gently out of the airlock and moved toward the planet, spinning slightly so it would be right-side-up by the time they entered the atmosphere. Tricia reached into her pocket and took out a flat metal box, from which she removed what looked like a small dirty cloth. Of course, Amanda recognized it as a dermal patch, or more informally, a deadhead spread. ``You mind?'' asked Tricia. ``No, not at all.'' Tricia put the cloth onto her head and pressed it down with her hand. It stuck there when she reached down to put the box back in her pocket. ``Do you mind me asking how you got started with that?'' Tricia looked wistful for a moment. ``Beta Cassoni three,'' she said. ``Aliens wrecked minds. Noticed deadhead wasn't crazy. Put on patch just in time. Still feels good.'' That was interesting. Apparently the patches dulled whatever part of the brain the aliens had been attacking. Amanda hadn't heard that before. Of course, the whole Beta Cassoni incident had been hushed up with fair success.\nThe shuttle started to vibrate as it entered the planet's atmosphere, and soon nothing was visible out the cockpit window. Amanda sat back and tried to enjoy the ride. Then, abruptly, the window cleared and Amanda could see a horizon, which was rising more and more quickly. The ground rushed up to meet the shuttle; the brakes kicked in just as Amanda thought that something had gone wrong and they were going to crash. The shuttle landed safely, if not very softly. Tricia took the patch, which had turned white, from her head, and climbed out of the cockpit. Amanda followed. The shuttle team was already climbing out of the crew compartment behind the cockpit, assembling on the ground outside. Amanda looked around. Aside from a purple tint in the sky, it looked like any ordinary grassy field on Earth. The higher gravity produced a very strange sensation. Amanda felt twenty pounds heavier, but the buoyancy of her clothes overcompensated slightly, so that she could move around more easily than usual. The end result was discomfort; Amanda hoped that this would be over quickly. ``Okay,'' Tricia said. ``Tribe five hundred meters there.'' She pointed. ``Bring idol first, natives follow.'' Amanda was impressed. If that worked, it would save the effort of rounding the natives up and forcing them into the shuttle. They might follow the idol right into the cargo space. One of the team opened the cargo doors and went inside, then drove a cargo hauler out onto the grass. It looked deceptively fragile, with an extensible crane sticking awkwardly out the back, but with gravity dampers could haul several tons of freight, if slowly. The driver's bubble was completely sealed, and there were small projectile and beam weapons mounted on all sides.\nAnother person climbed into the bubble, and the hauler headed toward the native camp. The rest of the team was mostly guards, who wouldn't be needed at all if the natives entered the cargo space of their own volition. There were a couple of specialists, one of whom was picking blades of grass and digging in the dirt, depositing samples into little cases.\nThere was little to do now but wait for the hauler to come back. ``Everyone inside,'' said Tricia. ``Natives won't see.'' The crew, with the exception of the grass-picker, climbed back into the crew compartment. Amanda joined them; Tricia went into the cockpit for a few minutes before doing the same. Eventually the specialist finished taking his samples and climbed in, just before the sound of the returning hauler could be heard. Someone closed the door, just as a precaution, and turned on a viewscreen. It showed the hauler making its way back, covered with natives who were trying to rip it apart and not succeeding. The idol was a four-meter-high blob that looked like it was made of intertwined twigs and branches. None of the natives were touching it.\nTricia's plan worked perfectly. The cargo camera showed the hauler entering, and more natives swarming on it from outside once it had stopped. There were a number of stragglers outside; the guards left the crew compartment and herded them in. The cargo doors closed. Of course, two of the crew were in the cargo hold, but they were quite safe inside the hauler's bubble. Tricia punched a few buttons on the wall, and the shuttle lifted off. The natives all collapsed on the floor as the apparent gravity increased. The lot of them only filled a quarter of the cargo space.\nSoon the shuttle was out of the atmosphere, traveling toward the mother ship. The first order of business, of course, was to unload the cargo, so the shuttle docked at a cargo lock. The hauler backed out into the main cargo bay, quickly followed by a horde of confused natives. A green gas billowed forth from one of the walls. As it engulfed the natives, they started to fall to the floor asleep, one by one. The hauler carried the idol to double doors on the side of the cargo bay, which opened to reveal a laboratory. The hauler's mini-crane deposited the idol there, then rolled back into the shuttle. The airlock closed. Soon the shuttle was back in its bay. Amanda noticed that most of the other shuttles were gone now, off to pick up more loads.\nShe wanted to go on another shuttle run, not so much for the pleasure of it as to make her report more interesting. It wouldn't affect her bonus, but come promotion time, the board would probably read whatever report she brought back from this mission.\nJohn was walking into the shuttle bay, clipboard in hand. Amanda headed toward him. With luck, there would be room on one of the next few runs.\nBefore Amanda could get a word in, John held up the clipboard. ``I've got you scheduled for a drop close to the alien wreck,'' he said. ``I figured you'd want to go on two drops to spice up your report.''\nAmanda was caught off guard; she wasn't used to being second-guessed. ``Why would you think that?'' John sighed. ``I have been on one hundred and fifty three missions with Interstellar Acquisitions. Twelve of those missions have been with observers who were high in management. Each one of them wanted to go on the first drop, then one more immediately after that; no more, no less. With all due respect, you don't really strike me as particularly different from any of the others. So I'm just trying to save us both some trouble and shuffling of schedules.''\nAmanda had no immediate response; she wasn't sure whether she should be impressed or offended. ``All right, one more drop now sounds fine. When is it?''\n``In about five minutes. Go get something to drink.'' Amanda did exactly that; she treated herself to a grape nutriade. Five minutes later, she was in the shuttle bay. Tricia was commanding Amanda's shuttle again. Amanda wondered who would sit in the cockpit with Tricia if there weren't a corporate observer handy.\nThe launch was a perfect duplicate of the last one. This time, Amanda could bear to watch the planet hanging overhead. The atmosphere was bumpier than before, but didn't make for a terribly uncomfortable ride. As the shuttle descended, Amanda could see the crater containing the alien crash site to her left. This part of the planet was heavily forested, but there were no trees for miles around the crater.\nThe heavy foresting presented a problem for the shuttle; the only large clear area was right in the middle of the tribe's primitive village. Tricia worked the controls for a few seconds, and the shuttle slowed, then stopped in midair. There was a slight bump ten seconds later. ``Sleep gas,'' Tricia explained. ``Natives run if we land. Gas them first.'' The shuttle touched down several minutes later, probably crushing a couple of natives unlucky enough to be caught in the middle of the open area. This was a larger settlement than usual, though, so a couple of natives one way or the other wouldn't make much difference.\nAmanda and Tricia got out of the cockpit. The sleep gas had turned inert now, so the shuttle team could go about the business of collecting unconscious natives and piling them in the shuttle's cargo hold. As before, a few specialists took samples of the local plant life and topsoil.\nThis settlement's idol was about twenty meters behind the shuttle; Amanda walked to it for a closer look. At first glance, it looked like a four-meter-high pile of twigs. But upon closer inspection, Amanda could see that the twigs were woven in intricate patterns, abstract shapes. One, a sort of figure eight, caught Amanda's eye. This would do very well in an alien art auction.\nSomeone drove the hauler out of the shuttle and drove toward the idol. Amanda moved out of the way, watching the flimsy-looking crane lift the idol onto the hauler's flat bed. The rest of the team was finishing with the native collection. Amanda climbed back into the cockpit, where Tricia was playing with the controls.\n``Something wrong?'' Amanda hadn't seen Tricia touch the controls more than once on the last drop. ``Nav computer down,'' replied the deadhead. She pressed a button. ``Morris to mother. Come in.'' A voice replied from somewhere. ``Mothership, Robertson here. What's up?''\n``Nav computer funny. Can't get prompt.'' ``Strange you should mention that. Our computer just started freaking out, too. A couple of techies are working on it.'' He paused. ``I guess you can't really take off without a computer. If you can't clear it up in five minutes, call again and we'll send down another shuttle to pick you up. Mother out.'' Tricia tried to get some response from the computer, but couldn't coax so much as a blinking light out of it. Finally she punched the window in frustration, and flipped the comm switch again.\n``Morris to mother. Come in.''\nRobertson replied again. ``Things are really screwed up here,'' he said. ``The computer just started firing maneuvering thrusters at random. The techies are trying to bypass the computer so they can fire the thrusters manually. Our orbit isn't looking too good right now. We're computing a comm path back to Earth, just in case.''\nAmanda stared at the control panel. ``Great,'' she said. ``Just great. Why do I have to be on the mission with all the bad equipment?''\n``Not bad,'' said Tricia. ``Computer should work. Someone tampered.''\n``Oh, that's even better. We have a saboteur. And I suppose he's on this shuttle, too, waiting to slit all our throats?'' ``Doubt it.''\nAmanda started to climb out of the cockpit. ``Let me know when if you get it working.'' Tricia shot her a malevolent look, then turned back to the computer.\nAmanda went to the cargo hold. The natives were still fast asleep, and would be for several hours. Amanda scrutinized the idol again, trying to find the figure eight that she had seen earlier. It wasn't immediately apparent as it had been the first time. In fact, hadn't the left side been a little fatter than the right, instead of the other way around like it was now? One of the twigs moved.\nAmanda gasped and stepped back. What was this thing? Something touched Amanda's shoulder. She spun around, ready to strike whatever it was. But it was only Tricia. ``Gately wants you,'' she said, pointing toward the front of the shuttle. The two women climbed into the cockpit again. ``Barris here,'' Amanda said. ``What do you need?'' John answered. ``I am ordering all crew to abandon the ship,'' he said. ``We are starting to enter the atmosphere, and we aren't going to be able to get control of the thrusters in time to correct it. I've sent a distress call to Central. We can expect to be rescued in a day or two, assuming the call made it through interspace. If not, you're standing on your new home.''\n``What? I can't accept that. Use every last one of your technicians if you have to, but make sure your next call gets through. I will not be stranded on this... this rock for the rest of my life.''\n``There isn't going to be a next call. It takes ten minutes to compute a communications path through interspace, and in ten minutes this ship is going to be a blob of molten metal the size of corporate headquarters.''\nAmanda bit back a reply; there was obviously nothing to be accomplished by continuing this conversation. ``Wonderful. All right. Keep me posted if anything else happens.'' ``There was one other thing. Ashton managed to translate a few documents that the science team found in the alien wreck.'' ``What do they say?''\n``Your friends the natives, aren't native. They're some form of exploration team, or their grandparents were.'' He paused. ``Look, I have to go. Just be nice to these primitives. We may end up living with them for a while.''\nIn the cargo hold, the Benefactor rustled in satisfaction, and felt its brothers do the same. The first aliens had seemed so helpless, so stranded. The brotherhood had helped them, asking nothing in return; how could an intelligent being act otherwise? But these newcomers' minds were filled with so many new ideas! The brotherhood was the most powerful force in the world; now it seemed so obvious that everyone else should serve it, not the other way around.\nNow that the newcomers' ship was destroyed, they would provide centuries of service to their new masters. Progress, thought the brothers. A sweet taste indeed.\nSteven Grimm is a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from which he is taking a forced leave of absence for computer no-nos.

An old cursive style script reads `Thar be dragons' on the map's right side....\"\n-- From \"Wormwood IV\" an outlaw journal distributed on piggyback virus.\nHanson sat up on the lower bunk and ran his hand along his unshaven face. The now early light of May was his alarm clock; Hanson was determined to leave the workhouse as soon as possible, even if today was a sleep-in day. The 50 or so workers were still asleep, exhausted by yesterday's 20 hour final stretch. Hanson knew he could hit the terminal early, register his work sheet and get outdoors before running into Chalker. Doing favors for Chalker had meant more than the usual hours of hacking nets and setting up scams. Hanson was sure that Chalker had bit off more than he could chew, and that arrest was soon on its way. The random work siphon scheme was crude by any programmer's standards and way beneath Hanson's, but involvement meant six month's drudge pay for the price of two, and a chance to get out of Wurkhaus for the entire summer. Quietly putting on the sheetsack and getting up, Hanson looked around the bunkroom at the snoring workers. The air was pungent with sweat and battery acid. Hanson cautiously creeped out along the fire-escape over to Chalker's room and looked in the window; Chalker's cot was surrounded with wine bottles, the sleeping supervisor still fully dressed. Good, a quiet move down the ladder put Hanson right by the work terminal. Hanson entered his card carver's number and noted with delight the work date coming up as 4 month's previous work plus the two he just had. He then pressed a new set of codes and had his earner's sheet shifted forward by 4 months. The new job code was entered to make him a Portuguese tutor, normally a non-earner for a drudge, but one that would make his vacation a lawful one. Hitting the close button caused four asterisks to appear. Oh, shit, I've been caught, groaned Hanson. A press of the disclosure option brought news that he was totally unprepared for. After five years of delays, Central State University was now prepared to hear his dissertation and grant him his Doctorate. A teaching position was also open in the department of Political Science, would he honor them with his presence at a faculty interview? Damn, this must be bad, they must be roping me in. Hanson confirmed the appointment time with his student number and closed the terminal. Giving one last look to the soot stained, gray pitted Wurkhaus, he knew that his vacation plans had gone sour. Attempts to skip the faculty interview would probably cause a roper to hit the streets and maybe kill him. Go to the interview, lie his way through the meeting and they would probably let him go in peace, especially if he feigned homeless fatigue syndrome. The one option that caused Hanson the most stress was that Yes, they do want to hire me. Don't expect that to be the case, it will never happen. But thoughts still hit Hanson with a sickening but elating roar. A real apartment, maybe a real house. Real computer credits, a savings account, free medical care, clothes,...a unicar.... Thoughts exploded out of Hanson's head when the guard dog started barking. The pitbull was the joke of the compound, the victim of a botched attempt to turn him into a roper through a head boost. But still, his barking might wake up Chalker. Hanson quickly jumped the chain-link fence and ran into the woods, finally filling his nostrils with air that didn't smell of recycled chopped old tires. If the origami tribe had survived the winter, Hanson might find them a few miles to the north. With his card carving skills for trade, it would be no problem finding someone who could build him a cardboard dome.\n\"The Brother Jim phenomena was best understood in the light of new research on the effects of television and mass media in the previous century. Ethnographers were able to chart the rising popularity of several concurrent events that gave rise to today's political institutions. Primarily, these were televangelism, mass media merchandising aimed at the home, and especially the synthesis of several psychological groups that were aimed at providing self-help in exchange for money. The replacement of the obviously religious motives of televangelists with those of self-help merchandising gave this political movement the catalyst it needed to become the motivating political force of the late twentieth-century. The birth of the movement was heralded by the release from prison of an individual calling himself Brother Jim. Replacing obviously sectarian appeals with those honed through the merchandising and self-help industry, this individual returned to the mass media with the dual goals of achieving the presidency and eliminating psychological competition from the labeled evils of `secular humanisms'. The cooptation of former self-help leaders such as the World Institute of Korea and Noonetics of California ensured that rival factions would benefit from the period of peaceful control that would follow. Political skirmishes over the combined meanings of state control and psychological control erupted around the turn of the century; the rising tide of economic wealth soon quieted dissent. Brother Jim's ability to appease contending interests and grant absolute political control to those following the Institute of Democracy and World Peace's directives gave him more absolute power than had been enjoyed by any American leader.\"\n-- Excerpted from \"Healing the split: Mind, religion and democracy in the New American Order\" Amazonian Technical Institute Press.\n\"The reports are probably correct: Brother Jim in all reality must consist of three or four individuals who through plastic surgery have made themselves similar to each other.\"\n-- From `The New Clan Separatist: The Search for 666' Freebrain Journal, publisher unknown.\nTwo miles up the road and off to the left, Hanson had found them. The woods had become a misnomer for a scratchy patch of land that had been so stripped of wood that even the stumps had been dug up. An origami man had been hauling strips of cardboard off the truck and was only too glad to agree to Hanson's terms when he found out he was a card carver.\n\"What can you get me?\" the origami man asked.\n\"A warehouse has been miscounting its stock for the last 2 months. Its right by Wurkhaus and the roper in front has been pretty much deactivated. If you steal their lunch wagon they'll never miss it. I wrote the skip page. All you need do it put this card in the wagon's side around 4 A.M., let it open up, steal what you want and take off\"\nA nod from the wiry face of the origami man meant the trade was go. He nodded at two emaciated looking kids who were on the top of the truck. The two generator bikes that powered the truck were in need of new chains, a mental note that Hanson stored away. The shorter of the two kids jumped onto the ground and picked up a large serrated knife. The taller kid tossed down sections of cardboard and the origami man took out his knife and started to saw away at the industrial scrap. The sight was remarkable to behold. With deft skill the triangular sections were sawed and pasted together with wall-paper paste tape. Within two hours a raised geodesic dome 12 feet in diameter had been erected on the grassy depression, complete with windows made from pressed plastic bags.\nThe origami crew stepped back to admire their creation.\n\"If it rains tonight, this is bad space. The four of us can carry it on the truck up the road about six miles where it will be better,\" said the origami leader.\nAn hour later the dome was on a raised spot, covered over with the expert camouflage of leaves and mud that was also the origamists stock-in-trade.\n\"I think I know where I can get new bike parts\" Hanson told the older man. Hanson thought of the upcoming interview. If anything, the interview would give him a chance to see the access code for a mechanic's warehouse in town close to the South Campus. \"This Monday, lets go together into town. I have to talk to an office on South campus.\" Hanson remembered that the South Campus was not at all the same as the North. It would have been much better to see North campus, but the South was better than any other opportunity that would visit the origamists. Always do favors for an origamist, Hanson said to himself, you never know when you might need their help.\n\"If I can steal one of their office cards, I can fix it so that we should have about 12 open hours in which we can raid their warehouse. I'm an expert at hitting the gates.\"\n\"See ya Monday morning,\" the gappy smiling origamist and his kids trucked away. Standing outside the largely invisible dome, Hanson recalled the several traps he had set at Wurkhaus. No doubt Chalker would be blamed for the theft of food from the wagon and upon being caught would have his employment grade zeroed out. Chalker would then come after him. Chalker was probably having fits right now. Chalker was one of those typically mind-burnt individuals who believed that life in a workhouse satisfied his heartfelt need to have a real roof over his head and to be a servant to the state. Chalker, upon meeting Hanson for the first time, was shocked to find that Hanson lived the life of a homeless nobody who lived off the land as a criminal. Their strained alliance had been forged through their common desire to gain money at expense of the employment list. Beyond this common goal was a seething hatred of Chalker and Hanson for each other. Hanson remembered talking to a drunken Chalker one freezing night at the beginning of the battery acid work order:\n\"I can't believe you think this is some sort of life! I'm only here because I was arrested last month and I have to stay at Wurkhaus for my two month sentence. There's hardly any food here, and man, look at your arms!\"\nChalker's arms had been bleached white through the many nights that the battery acid recycling order had been in effect. The smell of acid stung the air. A poster of Brother Jim hung on the wall next to Chalker's desk, its face bleached blue from the air-born acid; Hanson thought humorously that he looked more like a blue gorilla than the leader of the Free World.\n\"Shut up Hanson! I'm ON the plan, I'm no damn scraper like you! Its been worked out: you rig the net and we both get our share, and I sign you off.\"\nUnfortunately for Hanson, one work order scam became many little card carving schemes, all at Chalker's behest. Typical scenario: a box of ten to twenty cards would be dropped off at Chalker's desk at night. Hanson would match them with stolen access numbers and route the results to a false persona where deliveries and government bonuses would wait at a warehouse. Hanson would note with wry satisfaction that most of these schemes involved petty rip-offs of the Plan; for example, altering sales figures so that bonuses came more often. Hanson knew that it was very typical: propaganda was so fierce that anyone not selling his share of the Plan was considered a traitor to the common good. Like 75 percent of the population, Chalker could not come up with his share of the National Debt and was thus enrolled in the Plan. Pressure to do good found Chalker and like minded individuals involved in petty scams aimed at allowing their meager government appointed jobs to be supplemented with side credits. And, like many of these same individuals, Chalker found that splitting the take with so many compatriots yielded quite little. Hanson tried to impress on Chalker the illogic of this lifestyle, but to no effect. As an official homeless person, Hanson had more access food and housing on a temporary basis than Chalker normally saw in a year. The risks were there, the arrests happened two to three times a year, but compared to Plan victims, homeless life was to be greatly preferred. If Chalker had had a girlfriend, chances were that the front guard would not allow her into the workhouse. Absentee landlords frequently sent supervisors over who would claim that this week there was an emergency and we have to get through this, everyone together, so we have to have everyone working through the night. The same supervisors would also demand in extortion the fruits of corruption that Chalker had failed to hide from sight, often threatening to beat him up in his office. But Hanson, there in the office night after night, would see Chalker reading from the Good Works of Brother Jim, now official organs of the government of the United States of America. The image of Chalker that most hung in Hanson's mind was that of him sitting at his rusting hulk of a desk, late one rainy April night, the air hanging heavy with the stench of burning car tires that was the only way to heat the building, the walls covered with a brownish greasy color, and there, Chalker, hunched over a book titled \"Paradise Through Hard Work.\" Hanson realized that the food theft would trip off the Wurkhaus food counter, even though the net choke was hiding most of Chalker's warehouse rip-offs. If Chalker had had the brains, he would try to throw the gaff onto one of the 50 or so battery workers, but this most likely would not happen. Hanson settled on to the inflated mattress he dug out of his sheetsack and placed into the dome. If the interview was something legitimate, Hanson would never have to see the likes of Wurkhaus again. He took off the acid stained shoes and threw them out the dome door. More relaxed than he had been in many weeks, Hanson's last thought as he drifted off to sleep was the image of a girl, in her early twenties, wearing a torn shirt that said on the front \"No Justice for the Rainbow Tribe\".\n\"One of the first projects to receive approval was the new launch base on Marojo Island at the headways of the Amazon. Engineers had long written about the advantages of using the rotational force of the Earth's equator to add lift advantage to the newly proposed rockets of the Amazonian Space Agency (ASA). This dream became a reality when the combined German-Iranian offensive created a flood of highly educated Russian refugees who were only too glad to make the newly democratized Brazil their new home. The plan, long dropped by the U.S., of shooting the raw components of a deep space manned Mars rocket into orbit for assembly, has been pursued with exceptional vigor by this new generation of Brazilian space explorers infused with Russian know-how and experience. Launch of the new manned rocket, Tropic Wing, is for 8 months from this date, at a time which calculates the closest arrival of Mars to Earth along the flight path. The most powerful rocket engines in history will give these pilots the before undreamed of time of only 6 months in space, with Earth-like gravity being provided by a rotating bio-sphere that will travel inside the Nuclear driven hydrogen ionizer. (Cut to footage showing a man diving slow-motion into a swimming pool) For this brave Russo-Brazilian crew, no comfort has been spared: looking along the low-gravity axis of the sphere, you can see a health club devoted to all the benefits low-gravity exercise has to offer...\"\n-- Presentation to the Conference of the Union of Independent Southern Hemisphere States\n\"It has come to our attention that only 17 percent of the current population of Brazil claim Portuguese as their sole language. The influx of English speaking Russians into the Republic soon after the turn of the century seriously damaged the efficacy of this powerful and beautiful language which most Brazilians can no longer recognize with any form of fluency. The U.S. is now the only nation on earth that pursues use of this language with any enthusiasm, as it has become quite a mania in the central states where they employ its learning as a mark of cultural distinction. We are distressed to see that school age children in Brazil now read Jorge Amado in English translations and that even classic video presentations of the past have been lip-synced into English. Our distress continues at the failure of our government to help in the preservation of this unequaled muse of the poet's tongue. We have even had opportunity to speak with our members who number in their years the 80's and 90's, and tell us for fact that the cooking of a Brazilian cook who employs the English far inferior to that of one who employs Portuguese. They tell us if we do not act to stop this erosion we will not only lose the greatest will of the poets, but lose for eternity the great treasure of Bahian cooking, whose technique is hopelessly lost in the English language cooking manuals prevalent in this nation.\"\n-- Translated from \"Proceedings of the Brazilian Society for the Preservation of the Portuguese Language\"\nHanson sat leaning against the home-dome in the early Michigan May morning. The slightly fragrant, humid scent riding on the cool morning air gave Hanson the feeling that today was going to be a perfect day. Perhaps the message from last week's job terminal was read with too much paranoia. Hanson needed to clear his thoughts and settle his mind. Taking a gulp from his coffee thermo-cup and biting off a piece of sausage he swiped from Chalker's desk, he steadied his mind and started thinking about his past. Number One. For the last five years, just about everything he had ever owned was something that he had stolen. He had yet to find a job in which you were not under some sort of condition to be thrown into a workhouse, worked to death, and had all of your pay subtracted for \"living benefits and taxes to the government\". Okay. Now number two. For the last five years he was officially classified as a `homeless person' with no means of support. What is the punishment for a person with no means of support? You get sent to a workhouse. Okay, this makes sense. What do you do if you leave a work\nhouse and continue to be a homeless person? You get sent to a workhouse again. Good, makes sense. If you're like Chalker, you make the best of things, convert to the Plan, and hope for a better future. Things are miserable, yes, but if I bring in enough money, and have enough recruits into the Plan, I can rest easy if I get fifty people working under me. With 50, enough money is flowing in, my portion of the national debt is covered and I can store some remainder into National credits. With enough skill, I can get two or three recruits under me to handle the business and take off for the Florida Islands. Number three. Everyone has the same idea. If you're like Chalker, you think that every year will be different. So you apply to the government for a work needs prospectus and around February 1st, hundreds of cold, hungry out-of-homies come knocking on your front door, eager to escape the National Defense Draft and telling you they will be the best hard-workies you have seen forever. You tell them that the work will involve mold collections, battery acid recycling, lead extraction, anything. But they say, ya, anything to get out of another Michigan winter starving in a snow hut eating road-kill. But you say I don't want you working here if that's the only thing you want. I want people here who really want to be a part of the Plan. And they see the tar covered windows knowing that there are warm beds behind them and they say, ya. Yes, I'm part of the Plan. I'll do anything to be part of the Plan. And you hope against Thunder that the Winter is long and hard and Spring doesn't come early like it did this year, and this year you paid off your yearly tax share of the National Debt and you can actually call an agent and say I want to be spending time on one of the new Florida islands and I hear you have rental cars thrown into the price of the hotel because this year I'm going to drive across the new Cuba-Florida bridge and collect and barbecue fighting conches on my own personal beach...\nNo. Number three is a big no. If you're like Hanson, you go to college even though everyone says you're crazy, no one ever gets jobs `cause you go to college, you might as well go to a Brother Jim church! But you stick it out. You get a B.A. in political science and very carefully you get recruited into the Master's program because the professors realize that you know how to teach the traditional doctrines, but can discuss theory with them after hours. You have read anthropology and psychology and ask them hard questions but know when to respect the silences that mean that someone may be listening to them or may be bugging them....\n\"All phone systems and all apparatus related by appearance in either digital or analog form, are heretofore considered part of the public information system.

For example, if you have not been able to find a job (which in fact 75 percent of your fellow graduates have not been able to) you realize that there are few options open to you. For example, you will be sent to an international workhouse. (International House of Pancakes?). You most likely will not be hired by the University, even given the Doctoral degree. But, you will come to a certain realization, clear and simple. No job, the workhouse. The life of a criminal, the workhouse. The life of a non-criminal: hard work in the work house, near starvation. The life of a criminal: occasional hard work in the work house and the time of your life when you're not getting caught. If you're a good criminal, people are willing to pay you much more than they would a regular `trabalhista'. Ride out the occasional times spent in the `haus and you're on easy street. Of course it was not that simple. Living on the outside required certain skills, and the ability to see beyond surface appearance. For example, most grudges would look at the origamista and his scrawny kids and see the most destitute low- life. Look at his pedal-powered truck and geodesic domes and you see a singular genius who, in ancient times, would have been working for NASA. Get to know such people, and you form a network. A network, that if you're lucky, means you only have to work in a brutal German workhouse for only the most vicious months of the Winter and spend the rest of the time outside.\nNumber 4. This college interview thing. A real monkey- wrench. It means one of two things: something really good, or something really bad.\nOff in the horizon, Hanson saw the origamista and the pedal- truck heading toward the dome.\n\"Nationalism makes Christianity look like Buddhism\"\n-- The New Clan Almanac, 2nd Edition\nHanson leaped on the back of the truck. \"Let me help you pedal this thing.\" He could see that at one time this was a pickup truck, its rusted off parts now replaced with scraps of foraged plastics. The two bikes mounted on the bed were rusting apart, but still functioned well enough to transfer enough power from human legs to the electric motor via the generator. Within a few months rust would claim the entire bike array. \"I can get replacement bikes at the warehouse,\" yelled Hanson down to the steering origamista, who himself was contributing power via an old pedal boat system mounted in the cab. Hanson, who still used mountain bikes when he could steal them and not have them stolen from him in the middle of the night, had quite enough strength in his leg muscles to out peddle the origamista's kids. Their combined strength had powered the truck to a steady speed of 25 miles an hour. Within less than an hour they would be at the outskirts of the college section of East Arbor. A large iron flywheel, an antique over 100 years old mounted on a stand between the two bikes, spun with enough speed to allow Hanson and the older kid the luxury of resting every five minutes or so. The younger kid, released from duties and smiling, pulled out an ancient 8-track tape player with a pair of bashed in speakers. He inserted a grease smeared tape that had long ago worn off the paper label. The music, warbling through the dirty capstan, was unmistakably Willy Nelson, a past century tax dodger who had become a legend due to his capture by the government over tax evasion. \"On the road again, just can't wait to git on the road again...\" The Old Natural Science building was just now visible at the end of the road. Several autotrucks had passed them on the road into town, doing 50 to pass their 25. Hanson remembered reports that the trucks had hit several pedestrians in town. The German company that owned them was released from any liability: the trucks had no human driver, and therefore no negligence could be found. Like millions of others, Hanson and the origamista could not get jobs as truck drivers with any company that did real business. All trucks were now required to be operated by computer control under federal law due to safety and energy management issues. It was against the law for any underground truckers like the origami man to use electricity off the public grid or any form of rationed combustible fuel for their recycling activities. The origami man was often pulled over by the police for suspicion of electrical use, but soon let go when discovered that the original powertrain consisted of two kids, two rusting bikes, a flywheel generator and what energy the kids and old man could get from their morning breakfast of rice and beans.\nOh shit, here comes a cop. The best way to shake them was to give them the homeless fatigue syndrome rap. The old man and the kids already had it; they would give the cop their 8-track tape player and off they would be. Hanson had to remember. First, always smile. And when they ask you anything always bring up one thing, as if your brain finds it impossible to maintain any complex relationships. The MetalGermanFuzz stopped the truck and asked everyone questions. Laughter ensued, as it always did when he found that two little kids comprised all the power. But more questions came in Hanson's direction. It was obvious by his leg muscles that he had been eating a little too good.\n\"How come you here?\" MetalGermanFuzz intoned in a thick buzz-saw accent. Fortunately Hanson had hid his sheetsack under the sawed-up couch that functioned as the origamista's cockpit. Staring past the cop's face, a smiling Hanson started talking about an orange he had begged for breakfast. The cop kept at him with different questions only to have the answer be the orange. Hanson mumbled with delight about the orange. The pinched face of the cop erupted into laughter again. A no-homie hitching a ride on the old man's truck. Shaking his head with pity the German jumped back into the unicar, hit some buttons and sped off. The fuzz car like any other, steered under computer command. It was illegal for new cars to have a human operated steering wheel under Federal law for safety reasons. There had been some problems, sure, but new studies had shown that autosteering had reduced most accidents. A popular commercial showed a man leaving a bar, staggeringly drunk, and slopping into his unicar. After barely being able to insert the car card, the unicar lights up and speeds off. A text insert in broken English read `your designated driver is your car. Its the law.' Hanson remembered that a common worm prank at the time was to hit the ad with a virus that caused footage of an explosive car crash to be spliced to the end. Most national TV services had been so wormed out like this that the only way to deliver the good message of Brother Jim was to carry 16mm film projectors in a van and show current State news on the side of a building. Refurbishing old drive-in theators had become quite a mania, too. Armed guards prevented hardware wormers from getting in and cutting cords or throwing sand into the film aperture. This antique method had been uncovered by a Brother Jimmer working in Germany who discovered that in the First War of the Thousand Year Reich, the Good News of National Socialism had been taken into peasant communities with this method. And it worked! These ancient peasants had been so low-tech that they fell under the spell of 16mm. The content of the film was largely unknown, but one report writes that a film contained footage of the warm beds and good work conditions that would greet European no-homies in the workhouses that Himmler had just set up.\n\"Definition: Low-tech wormer: an individual who uses old fashioned media to do his phreaking. Example: using the now tons of discarded carbon to print the code for a worm. Distribute the newsletter by placing the carbon on a sheet of gelatin, running the prints and using it as wrapping paper for food. Note: current federal law prohibits the use of paper to transmit written symbols (see Omnibus Recycling Act) but no law says you can't wrap food with it!\"\n-- The New Anarchist's Cookbook\nThe pedal-truck had entered a narrow road that ran through South Campus. Hanson had the truck park a block away from the warehouse. The good thing about a pedal truck is that few people want to steal it when they find out all the work it involves to just get it to go. The four of them walked over to the warehouse across the street, avoiding a board-man who was trying to sell them brain-stim tatoos.\nSitting at the warehouse door was a chimp with a brain-boost wearing the blue Central Services uniform. The easiest score of all, chimps could read cards but could not piece together the complex underpinnings of a scam. Hanson decided he could skip plan A and go directly to plan B now that he saw the guard was a chimp. He smiled and walked up to the grizzled looking chimp, who was lethargicly playing Solitaire on a wood crate.\n\"I'm here for the shipment. This is my permit.\"\nThe chimp grabbed the card and placed it into the net choke. A green slip came out and the chimp looked at it slowly. A nod of his head was followed by the release of a lever which raised the metal door. Good, the skeleton page worm is still valid. The four ran in and quickly pulled the door shut. It was important not to raise suspicion; it was also necessary to keep out the tatoo seller who was milling around outside. Inside, Hanson knew that they had hit the motherload. Along the wall was a rack filled with Mountain bike parts.\n\"We have to be quick about this,\" Hanson whispered as he pulled out several cans of spray paint from his sheetsack. The paint inside was a special brownish-orange mixture that looked just like rust when sprayed onto metal. One of the little origami kids grabbed a can and started going over the bike parts. \"Rust never sleeps!\" Within an hour the paint had dried and the four started bundling together the chains, frames and wheels that they would assemble the next day. The origamistas would have their new power bikes, but for Hanson a mobile bike was in the works. Using his artistic skills, Hanson would soon be riding around in a new MolyTi Special hidden under a fake patina of rust. To complete the illusion, the new GelSim seat would be hidden under an old piece of burlap and rusty bolts would be attached to the frame with wire. After reopening the door, the four ran the parts across the street and into the truck using a relay approach. The blue chimp watched attentively and nodded from time to time. When the truck was full, Hanson told the old driver, \"I'll be back at my dome sometime tomorrow and we'll put everything together\" The origamistas smiled and soon the pedal truck disappeared down the street. Hanson ducked down a side street to get out of view as quickly as possible. He knew that as soon as the campus security showed up, the tatoo seller would be able to fill in the details of the heist that would be beyond the ability of the chimp to relay. Hanson looked at himself. If he was going to an interview, he had certainly come to appear as a most undesirable candidate. Acid had streaked part of his black hair white, rust colored paint had dripped all over his shirt and pants and 2 days of stubble covered his face. No time to clean up, the interview was in half an hour, the time it would take to walk to the office. Besides, if they really want to hire me, my looks won't make any difference. Walking northeast, Hanson quickly left behind the warehouse section of South Campus. Besides himself and the tatoo seller, Hanson noted that there were no people occupying this neighborhood at all. Most of the metal sheds being used by Central Services were marked with the simplified logos that made up Standard Primate English. Several times, Hanson walked past the shuffling 4 foot forms of the workchimps in their blue uniforms, their hollow eyes staring up at him, and getting out of the way quickly if he was in their path. Staring out the window of an abandoned looking building was a gray haired chimp who eyed Hanson with fear. The last building that Hanson had to walk past to get onto the academic complex was a food bar. The two chimps seated at the small metal food trough looked up at him and stopped eating. Hanson ran across the street as quickly as he could, dodging a cart full of scrap metal that was being driven in by a chimp wearing a Central State cap. Hanson rarely came into town, and all of a sudden something had really bothered him. Do I really want to work here? Fear gagged his throat. The final image of the warehouse district that really disturbed him was of a chimp toddler on a plastic trike, bubbly happy looking, and pulling a little plastic wagon. In the wagon were a bunch of bones, probably horse or pig bones, but from the distance across the street, Hanson couldn't be sure. Turning away for one last time, he headed toward the row of pine trees that ran along the academic complex.\n\"Modern historians are at a loss as to what specific event could be pinpointed to as the beginning of the current American Civil war. Rather, they emphasize that the general trends building toward the collapse of the current Union had been in place for many decades: the 8 trillion dollar federal debt, the steadily eroding quality of life, the purchase of key American industries by private creditors within the International Monetary Fund, and the growth of a new American middle class raised on the fruits of the Information Technology revolution, left little doubt that any state able to declare independence from Washington D.C. would do so. The outlaw congress of the Iowa Convention published the famous Adam's Doctrine, lifting verbatim from the Founding Fathers comments that made it a democratic right to reject governance as it was currently practiced in Washington. The forceful seizure of great tracts of land throughout Kansas by the IMF to cover defaults on the debt led to great violence as local populations fought against the newly installed German landlords. The retreat of the German security guards along a line demarcated by the Mississippi river led to the publication of the Economic Bill of Rights, having as its main passage, \"No American citizen shall ever be held liable for debt secured or maintained by any organ of government.\"\n-- History of the IMF in the twenty-first century: Original source unknown.\nSeveral buildings in the Academic Complex were obviously quite new. At least since the very last time that Hanson had been here almost 5 years ago. Like thousands of other so called residents, Hanson's hasty flight from Central State had been signaled by the firebombing of the Administration building with the ensuing riot shutting down services for almost a month. At the interview, Hanson would no doubt be quizzed on the meaning of these events and his possible involvement with them. Hanson held out the worn student identification card that still functioned for him from time to time. When economic conditions permitted, Hanson was able to avoid workhouse life by claiming that he was still enrolled in the Doctoral program of the Department of Political Science. To make the act more convincing, he would show the drudge ropers several of the books he carried in his sheetsack, like \"Harmony and the New States\" or \"Brother Jim: An American Life\". The MetalFuzz were guests in the states, and often didn't hide their disdain for Brother Jim, but someone actually getting a Doctorate in this stuff must be so mind burnt that he was completely harmless.\nHanson remembered one incident four years ago: sitting under a tree one summer afternoon, he had been absorbed in a pair of sunglasses that a workhouse drudge had traded him for a grasshopper-bot Hanson once swiped from a landscaper as it left the compound Hanson had been roped into. The glasses were a common novelty at the time; they usually contained photos inscribed in the lenses by a layered grating process. When the wearer stared out through the lenses in bright light, holographic photos would appear suspended out in front of the viewer's face, the most common photos being life sized nude women. But these glasses were quite different. An array of pages appeared in front of Hanson, photos of pages from an old book whose sheets were often creased and torn, edges ripped. The reader of the book was told to read the book and pass the sunglasses on to someone else. Using a small tab on the glasses allowed Hanson to focus in the individual pages of the hologram. This was a photo of a complete, uncensored, unrevised version of George Orwell's \"1984\" made from a book many decades old! The Holy Grail for a cyberworm like Hanson, the real book was rarely seen in any version other than the burger wrappers that smeared their food contents blue with mimeo ink from the few paragraphs that got out through the low- techers roving library. And this was the real version at that. The current library edition contained all sorts of crap about Brother Jim and his defeat of Communism, changes made with the \"wonderful cooperation of the George Orwell estate\". Jeez.\nIt was with understandable absorption that Hanson allowed himself to be thrown off guard when the compound curfew fuzz kicked his feet yelling \"No more lunch hour!\"\nThis fuzz was typically outstate, proud of the fact that he could only use Standard Primate English with his \"Happy Debt Holder Scum\", typically cursing in German most of the time. The guard quickly grabbed the sunglasses from Hanson's face and the Brother Jim book he had been fake-reading from his hands.\n\"You Doctor kid I hear? You know German?\"\nYa. Hanson knew. He had to pass the University exam in order to maintain the stipend, but that was many years ago.\n\"Here read this.\" The guard handed Hanson a crisp looking little black book labeled `Mein Kampf'. \"Learn it. Feel it.\"\nThe current Brother Jim administration had made it illegal for the IMF host forces to bring in any non-English material; but this didn't stop a group of MetalFuzzes from importing boatloads of the `Nazi Bible' into the country so that \"finally these screwed up Americans can think straight.\" The smiling guard then handed Hanson back his glasses and let him spend the rest of the afternoon under the tree reading. The next day Hanson found that by remembering a few choice phrases from the book and shouting \"Sieg Heil\" to the guards, he would be left alone to do what he wanted. Pretty soon all the Americans in the summer compound were imitating him. Especially effective was the practice of getting together with the guards and practice marching around, their hands raised together in the Nazi salute. If they did that a few times a day, the guards would get so lax that they could even run out at a night and hit the beer stands. They made sure to bring back a few bottles for the guards. One of the guards would make a comment in English that Hanson didn't understand: \"So you now a real Hogan's Hero, Ya?\" An occasional drunken conference with the guards on the \"need for revolution\" and things got so lax that Hanson was able to get his own terminal smuggled into the compound. After carving up a few cards for the Fuzz who could then order all the IMF goods they wanted, Hanson was pretty much told he could leave any time he wanted. \"But be careful. Not all are like us!\" Up to that time, no-homies dreaded being roped in by the IMF so much that they were eager to find work with any American drudge who was rising up the ladder of the Plan. But within a couple of years it had become quite apparent: sign up for the Plan and get the worst work orders handed out by the IMF, but if you fake out the Fuzz, work real hard for an hour or two each day and sincerely ask the Germans to explain this or that meaning of `My Struggle', wear a `Mit Blut und Eissen' T-shirt, and your chances for survival and freedom became much better.\nThe present now found Hanson entering the new administration building. Under the dull light of a gray Michigan morning, the new red granite facade hid any evidence of the firebombing that occurred five years ago. All around him, Hanson was impressed by the newness that meant that at one time or another everything had been replaced at some time in the past five years. Standing at the top of the new steps, he surveyed the crisp geometric forms of the landscaping that went from the building in a line to the north and neatly hid the monorail track. The expense was obvious; pine trees that had been over 20 feet tall were completely wiped out in the bombing five years ago. Yet now, in the exact same spots were trees that reached 30 feet. From his vantage point Hanson could make out another strange sight. On the northwest corner of the South Campus was a cardboard shanty town erected by another contingent of the Homeless Tribe. In years past the attempts at putting up cardboard relief shelters right on the grounds had been repulsed by the tacitly approved drunken raids of the skinhead children who were attending the University while their IMF administrator parents did their stint in the U.S. But the size of this community meant the rules had changed. At the edge of the community could be a seen a large drive-in-theater screen.\nClose to the entrance was the typical stack of student papers. Picking one up, Hanson was grateful that English was still used on campus, if the headlines were any indicator:\nBorder Buildup: IMF Agrees to Transfer of Military Hardware to Indiana. South Brazil: Government Reports Evacuation of Sao Paulo Complete. Amazonia: Mars Launch on Schedule. Western Americans Included on Crew. Riot: Nazi Traditionalists Fight IMF Over Land Rights, Clan Brought in to Mediate.\nHmm. Western America. Poor people are left in peace there. Give any indication you want to move there and risk having a roper visit you in the middle of the night to tear your throat out. The Jimbos and the Nazi's had a nice sounding phrase: \"Any debt holder caught attempting to leave the area of his currently assigned work precinct will be arrested for treason against the state.\" Depending on the zeal of the MetalFuzz, you could easily be shot if your homeless condition was one that included a foot sojourn heading west. Since Michigan was surrounded by water, it was travel to the south of your assigned work district that bought immediate suspicion. Travel north was no longer possible, with the bombing of the bridge and snipers camping on the shores of the large beach estates now traded around the IMF like so many poker chips.\nHanson's reflection shot back at him from the door's glass. The paint, the filth and the stubble left no doubt that he was a no-homie, an image enforced by the wild mane of black hair streaked in white, looking so much like a skunk being torn to shreds in a losing battle against a cyberfly.\nThe walk into the now carpeted lobby bought a nod from the reception chimp who sat behind the registration desk. The chimp was one of those few ten percent of the brain-boost population who could type slowly but with accuracy, and hence were in great demand as office chimps. The chimp was even at home in the suit he wore, wearing a velcro attached tie. A tap of the keys bought a message to the overhead screen, the characters reading \"You can't come into the interview looking like this. I will let you into the health club in the basement where you will clean up and get your hair cut. Clean clothes will be available. I will let them know what is happening. Be back at my desk at 11:00.\" A genius. Most chimps only had a general concept of time, but this one could think forward to something happening in the future. Hanson looked down in embarrassment at the T-shirt he was wearing. Beneath the paint streaks was visible the symbol of an American flag, the stars in the upper-left rearranged so that they formed the pattern of a Swastika.\" A logo at the bottom read \"IMF Summer Tour -- The Broken Crosses\" and on the back read \"Roadie\". Shit, they could get real pissed if they saw this. Best move was to hit the health club and throw it in the trash as quickly as possible.\nThe Broken Crosses was one of the truly funny media scams to happen all last summer. A group of homeless skinheads had formed a parody rock band using work permits that Hanson had hacked out through an IMF net choking on a wormOS. Several times that summer they had gotten onto college campuses doing their show, although they skipped Central State for obvious reasons. Hanson had wormed up a T-shirt kiosk so that it would print up these shirts, which they exchanged by the hundreds for campus dorm food tickets. The Crosses' lead singer had even managed to get fake registrations so that they could spend the whole summer as `guest artists from Latvia'.\nBefore long, a media virus from an unknown source was proclaiming that the Broken Crosses was the most popular band of the summer. The lead singer was soon seen on a Caroline Satellite solemnly telling the interviewer of the many years of struggle they had to go through in Latvia before they finally hit it big, Thanks to all you loyal fans who stuck it out with us all these years. The mania was an endless source of laughs; Hanson even remembered one 18 year old girl telling him that her older brother had some of their bootlegs from years ago. Standing around on campus, adopting a fake Latvian accent and pretending to `manage' the Broken Crosses, got Hanson more sexual favors than he had seen his whole life up to that point. Typical venues for the group included such songs as \"Let's Shave Hitler's Mustache\"; Hanson even contributed lyrics to song that got an IMF Grade 4 Ban called \"IMF and I am pissed!\". Needless to say, the Grade 4 Ban instantly catapulted the group to number 1.\nBefore getting roped in, at the time the Broken Crosses' media star had burnt out and the gig was up, Hanson had managed to steal as much as 2000 student card numbers and all the files that went with them. A whole block of them went to Chalker later that year. Chalker, unfortunately didn't realize that if you ran a group of foreign numbers all at once, the IMF was sure to get tipped eventually, especially if they were student numbers from rich kids' families. Hanson now felt sorry for Chalker. One step forward and two steps back, welcome to the Plan.\nA push of the Health Club lock got Hanson into the shower-room wear he quickly stashed his sheetsack into a locker and slapped on a lock. After showering and wrapping himself in a towel, he walked over to a barber chair where a chimp was waiting for him. The scissors the chimp held looked like blunt kindergarten ones. Slowly and precisely, the happy looking chimp chopped on the wild, black mane for half an hour. Looking in the mirror, Hanson could see that most of the white streaks were gone. A little bowl-cuttish, but I've had much worse. The chimp then gestured to several hangers on a rack that contained blue blazers and matching slacks. After the right fit was found and tried on, Hanson then stepped back to admire himself. Jeez, I look just like a Brother Jim, he thought. In a sarcastic fake southern voice, Hanson barked \"No turning back! I'm stepping with the Plan!\" The barber chimp pursed his lips in a simian smile. Hanson ran back up stairs, the clock at five to 11.\n\"You can go into the first door on the left\" read the overhead character display.\nA tall, blond, blue blazer wearing man stepped from behind a desk to greet him.\n\"Mr. Arthur Hanson. Have a seat.\" The man said grinning from ear to ear. Hanson sat down in the plush office chair. The office was large, with several abstract paintings on the walls. \"Do you smoke? No? Good. At ten dollars a pack I should quit.\"\nHanson felt very nervous. Everything was new. Everything smelled new. This is the big rope, I just know it.\nDread knotted his stomach. A tall woman, about 6 foot four, long blonde hair, stepped into the office scowling at the two of them. Oh, shit, here it comes.\n\"Bob, what do you think you're doing? Do you think that maybe he's even had breakfast today? Christ.\"\nBob burst out laughing, \"Alright, I apologize. Let's head down the hall and get you something to eat.\" The woman this time cracked out into a smile.\nWalking down the hall, the three of them passed several University employees, all the same, all wearing Navy Blue and smiling to each other. A three foot tall chimp carrying a file folder ran into Bob's leg. Bob smiled, and said \"Whoa there little guy!\" and patted him gently on the head. But so strange to Hanson were the eyes of the chimp, widened in fear during the three seconds that the pat lasted. When the pat ended, the chimp quickly scurried away, the folder clutched tightly to his chest.\nThe three entered a large sunroom. Milling around the food buffet were even more University employees. Their numbers now confirmed for Hanson the fact that none of them were shorter than six foot. The men were often 7 feet. Women of 6 five seemed very common. And all had blond hair. Hanson was motioned to a chair. Right behind him came the chimp pushed cart filled with Burgers, Fries, and Onion rings. \"Eat up!\"\nThe blonde woman had introduced herself as Susan, Vice President for Business Development. Bob interjected, \"Look here Art, can I call you Art? Good. The monorail leaves right from this building and goes directly to North Campus. You don't even have to step outside if you want at all, and after all, who would WANT to. When you get your car you just leave it home. Great system I would say.\" Susan cut him off. \"Bob, the poor guy must be so mixed up. We haven't even told him why he's being called in for an interview!\"\nMore knots in Hanson's stomach. Yep, they're playing with me alright.\nBob held out his hand and gripped Hanson's tightly, \"Congratulations, Mr. Hanson. You have been awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Political Science. If you will accept the position, we invite you to join our faculty as chair of the department of Political Science. Your duties to commence immediately with teaching duties to begin this Fall Semester. Here are the keys to your house,\" Bob handed him a house card.\n\"The car should be in the garage tomorrow. If you need anything at all contact this number and they'll get it for you. Your regular faculty office will open next Monday; an assistant will be there to set up your office this weekend. The info you need should be right on the card. Now what?\" Bob looked at Susan who had been straining her face at him. \"Just wait. O.K. do you accept?\"\nA half sound of \"ya\" left the throat of the now shocked Hanson. \"Good. O.K. Sue, go ahead and ask,\" replied Bob.\nSusan pulled out a music CD and handed it to Hanson. On the cover was an overly pixellated photo of Hanson and the Broken Crosses standing on the makeshift stage of last year's \"IM Pissed\" concert. The title contained one of Hanson's old worm permutations, for now the group had been labeled as `Art Hanson and the Broken Crosses'. Susan excitedly asked \"Would you autograph this for my daughter?\" Then to Hanson's complete shock the statuesque and reserved looking woman growled in a fake Latvian accent \"IMF and I am pissed! My daughter is going to be so thrilled to find that you are working on Campus!\"\nBob laughed. \"O.K. Good buddy. Need anything at all just call my office.\"\nThe two administrators got up sharply from the table and strode away, leaving a permanently bewildered Hanson sitting beneath the hot mid-day sun now coming through the sun room canopy.\nHalf in a daze, he left and went back to the lobby. Facing the reception chimp, he muttered in English, \"Can you get a message sent for me?\" The chimp nodded yes. A message was written giving the location of the cardboard dome. Directions were given to have it tacked to the door. The message read \"Keep everything you want, even the dome if you can use it. I won't be coming back. I just got hired at the University.\"\n\"Concurrent with the new Economic Bill of Rights was a series of Acts which were quickly adopted by the newly Debt Free States. The Fair Land Use and Homestead Act was quickly ratified at the Convention held in Mexico City, home of the new League of Debt Free Nations. Its most eloquent orators had to fight against the accusation that old style Leninism would result, but eventually even the staunchest critic was won over.\"\nEric Miller is a graduate student at Michigan State University where he studies the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) in architectural and product design.

Huge headline in today's newspaper that the first satellite is circling the earth. For a minute I lay on the bed with a pounding heart. Some events really hit me hard. During the first forty years of my life, I admired technology. When Wernher von Braun told me about his future projects, such as a flight to the moon, I was fascinated. But Hitler, with his technologically-based doctorship and his assembly-line extermination of the Jews, shocked me so deeply that I can never again be so naive about technology. Every advance nowadays only frightens me. News like this account of the first satellite makes me think of new potentialities for annihilation and arouses fear. If they fly to the moon tomorrow, my fear will be all the greater.\"\n-- Albert Speer, \"Spandau -- The Secret Diaries\"\nHanson looked at the office chimp and waved his hand. The chimp responded with a very mechanical nod that betrayed a complete lack of spontaneity.\n\"Do you speak English?\"\nSuddenly wide eyed, the chimp typed as fast as his fingers could hit the keyboard. It was obvious that the clumsy fingers hit and missed keys almost at random. On the overhead screen could be read the message, \"No, but I can hear and type English very well.\" The chimp grunted in a whoo-whoo, obviously delighted at the personal request to know his abilities.\nOkay, thought Hanson. Link this together. Bob and Susan, like its all one joke. The chimps, the menial tasks. He also noticed one thing. The chimp typed things that came out in perfect English, even though you saw his fingers do things like hit two keys at once. An Intelligent keyboard. All at once it hit Hanson.\n\"Do I have my own account?\"\n\"Of course,\" signaled the chimp.\nHanson ventured forward with a comment, \"I can tell that you're very good with computers. I could really use your help.\" The chimp ooped with delight. Several administrators walked past the desk in the lobby, but they paid no attention to what they were doing. Another fact was confirmed: none of these people ever carried folders or paper of any kind. The two or three chimps who scurried in and out carrying files received no attention. Hanson felt comfortable enough to assume the chimp's place behind the workstation. A press of the `Flocculating' icon prompted `type your question, please, and enter your name.' \"What is my apartment like?\"\nThe video that popped up showed a small, split-level white townhouse. A saccharine voiced cooed softly from the speaker, \"Welcome to North Campus Village, faculty section. Every effort has been made to match your personnel profile with your surroundings. Please convey any changes you would like made to us immediately. Remember that new housing assignments will require 2 weeks to be processed.\" The camera traveled through the street to show each little unit with its own plot of Kentucky blue grass out front. The narrow sidewalks lead from the front door to the crisp line of curb that lined immaculate black asphalt streets. Everything in the video looked so brand new that Hanson suspected a simulation was at work. \"You will be pleased to know, Dr. Hanson, that your new neighbors have been selected for your intellectual stimulation. Programmers, artists and writers on the faculty live in a one block radius from your house.\" A close-up on the front door showed a box-like contraption wheeling itself in. \"For your convenience, a complete food preparation and house cleaning unit is on all call 24 hours a day. For your driving convenience, a car has been matched to your personality profile; we believe you will enjoy this limited edition 1996 Lamborghini Diablo.\" A steering wheel too! The video stopped. The chimp pressed the \"Get Help\" option and pointed at Hanson's bowlcut. \"Right.\" A request for an appearance stylist was typed after Get Help. And another thing. There is no way I'm going to wear a Brother Jim monkey suit, no offense to you, chimp. I may be a professor, but I wear what I wear. A request was typed out to find the nearest clothing store. The Image Boutique on North Lake Drive would do for both the haircut and clothes. The uniform: Prewashed jeans, Hawaiian shirt, black leather jacket and running shoes.\nThe mail icon on the view panel blipped a few times. The chimp pounded the keyboard and up scrolled a screen with the message: \"Art! Art! Good Buddy. We've got to talk. Call me at A-2042 tonight. Mari and some friends want to meet you. I've got a great idea for an album, need your help. Faculty get together this Friday too. See ya. Dr. Bill Britten, Department of Physics.\" The chimp looked at the panel and pulled his lower lip. A command prompt at the bottom read \"Message #2: Address 2Hanson --For your eyes only.\" The chimp scowled and pressed the paper print button and handed the sheet to Hanson without looking at it. This letter was much less cheerful than the other.\n\"Mr. Hanson: Congratulations on your new appointment. Must see you immediately. Please go to South Campus library at once. Enter door and tell guard that you're with `Research.' Sit at table by window. Wait for message from us to be hand delivered. We know who you are and have news which is of urgent interest to you. We are friends. Please be careful.\" A black block of characters read \"To dispose, Press here twice in rapid succession.\" Tap tap. The paper dissolved in a small cloud of black ash. Part of it landed on the chimp's head and had to be wiped off. Hanson knew something was up. `We are friends. Please be careful.' Ya, right. People were always pressing him for favors. But it was his doing favors that kept him out of the worst camps. But he felt like forgetting message two and heading North to his new house. But this certainly would come back to haunt him. Better get it over with.\n\"It has come to our attention that some confusion has resulted over the proper Canadian usage of the term American. After great pains were apparently affected by the Reich Senator from Georgia to include us in his definition of what was covered by the term American, we have been prompted to deliver by official channels the current state of this usage.\nGentlemen, upon hearing the word American, we are proud to accede that this nation consists only of Washington administered states, German occupied Ontario and Montreal, and the newly independent Western states. We of Northern Canada and rebel Alaska no longer use this name to refer to ourselves and would greatly appreciate it if your correspondence would reflect this fact from now on. Thank you.\"\n-- UN Security Council address from the consul of Commonwealth of Independent Arctic States.\nHanson made a quick exit out of the Administration building. A chimp in a white golf cart had been waiting for him and after a 5 minute trip through a spruce covered trail, the two of them stopped at the trash strewn edge of the homeless village. He motioned the chimp to go into the village, but a fear stricken look at the ragged shuffling figures inside and he knew that he would have to continue on foot. The chimp burrowed his head back into his shoulders and sped off in the cart.\nHanson had been dropped off at the old University sidewalk that ran north to the Bell Tower and Library. In its present state, the sidewalk would challenge the most rugged mountain bike; the cement slabs had broken up into complete rubble at several points and were covered over by long grass and weeds. Old black and white photos painted a picture of the walk in better times: smartly dressed young men and women, argyle socks, plaid skirts, carrying books. Classes chosen without the approval of a career officer, careers chosen at freedom.\nOh, Central in our hopes and dreams\nTo thee we work and strive\nTo shine a light upon ourselves\nSo that we a path may shine...\nSigh. The old Bell Tower could be seen up the path. Like everything in sight, it had been appropriated in some way by the homeless. Three youths were at the top of the tower inside the cement Tudor battlements that closed in the roof. An old oil drum made into a barbecue was spilling out smoke. Squint your eyes just a bit and it looks like you've signed up as a free-lancer in Richard II's army, advancing on the French. The beauty of the once-grand lawn had evolved into the squalor of a trash strewn sea of mud. A hundred crude huts made out of cardboard and scraps of wood littered the area. Shuffling old women in long mud-stained skirts, wild-haired teenagers and stubbly faced old men milled around. An old man stood at the entrance of a cardboard hovel to Hanson's right.\n\"Bom Dia, Herr Professor!\" squeaked the old man. Hanson started to say \"What?\" but quickly glanced at the blue polyester encircling his sleeves, realizing that the appearance of crisp blue polyester signaled authority, especially on the campus. Hanson replied in greeting, using the Portuguese he had learned in Brazil. What came back from the old man was a strange form of Pidgin, a kind of half German, half Portuguese mixed with American street slang. Hanson could only finish the conversation by nodding in pretend understanding and quickly left.\nThe Library presented a strange sight. Like most other buildings in town, most of the windows had been long smashed out, or removed and replaced by the ubiquitous sheets of tarpaper that the nazi occupation government was so keen on using. Most of the base of the brick on the first level was covered over with a mass of lean-tos filled with old women selling food rations and recycled household appliances. A kid was in one tent trying to sell potential customers on the idea of using a waffle iron as a clothes ringer. In another, partially-opened boxes of spray paint held up a cardboard sign which read, \"Spray on Hair. Real Cheep. Used by Pope Ron.\"\nThe warm air of the afternoon left a kind of festive feeling, and in spite of the constant background smell of burning tires, the heavenly smell of garlic, sage, olive oil and ginger wafted in from several woc fires. Even the old fountain was still up and running in the front plaza and several village kids ran in and splashed around. A PVC pipe wired to the fountain filled the water buckets of several people standing in a line.\nHanson reached the front entrance where a teenaged guard stood watch at an old school desk. He was bald with an M. C. Escher design tattooed to the top of his scalp. A pitbull\/rottweiler mix guard dog eyed him lazily.\n\"I'm with research.\" The dog's ears perked up as Hanson spoke.\n\"Oh, go inside and sit down. Someone will be down to meet you.\"\nThe first available seat was a chair by one of the few remaining windows on the first level. Hanson could see the guard and dog from behind as well as the view down into the homeless village. After 15 minutes a small figure darted up to the guard and his dog, a Capuchin monkey with plastered back gray face hair and alert blue eyes. The monkey wore a small denim backpack from which he pulled a biscuit. The biscuit got tossed into the air where it was caught and devoured by the dog, who happily wagged his tail. The monkey darted quickly into the entrance and stopped momentarily to eye Hanson before running off into the dark hallway of the unlit interior. Hanson's eyes became used to the interior darkness. All around him could be seen stacks of old books, magazines and bunk-bed mattresses. Piles of tin-cans, loops of wire and neatly stacked corrugated boxes lined the walls. Most of the old book stacks were still there, and at first glance they seemed to hold to capacity dozens of old-style bound books. The stacks of mattresses betrayed the fact that the Library opened its doors as a homeless shelter during the worst winter months. Closer to the window, and more readable in the dust-filtered light were several scattered piles of full color posters. Hanson bent down to pick one up and positioned it front of him. The top logo read:\n\"Join the Advanced Guard. Become part of a revolution.\"\nTwo figures made up the body of the poster. One was an Iranian extremist who held his fist into the air. He was wearing the Klan robe with a Prussian cross emblazoned on the chest. The other figure seemed to be an American youth holding a rifle in both hands. A maniacal smile was on the youth's lips; the unnatural appearance of it lead Hanson to conclude that the smile itself had been morphed into the original photograph. Poor guy, he was probably a war prisoner to begin with. But even worse was the Klan robe. Who would have thought that Iran would embrace the Ku Klux Klan. They still looked at the late President Duke as being some kind of a god. Yeck.\n\"Hidden inside our advance to a new production system is a potential for social change so breath-taking in scope that few among us have been willing to face its meaning.\"\n-- Alvin Toffler\nHanson's reverie on the complex web of international events was broken by the appearance of the monkey who jumped out of the darkness. A tiny hand thrust out a card which read, \"Follow me.\" Reluctantly, Hanson left his chair to follow the monkey in the dark interior. A door at the extreme end of the hall opened up, and with it came enough light to navigate by. The light allowed closer examination of the book stacks. Each shelf contained a large pile of books that had been shellacked together with a tough polyurethane glue. As book burning was considered too passe and reminiscent of violent times past, the new censors at Central had sent most of the Library's books to a factory where they underwent `archiving preservation' so that `future generations could enjoy them.' Unfortunately, the process turned the books into little more than unopenable plastic bricks but they did look really nice on the shelves. Lately, though, censors worried a little less about the issue, as Compressed English was now widely adopted in grade schools and kids shown an example of 20th century English usually gave up in despair over the contorted arrangement of double letters and strange vowel combinations.\nHanson and the monkey ascended a staircase leading to the upper levels. The stairwell was filled with large piles of coiled-up copper wiring, old style cable television wiring, and telephone cords. Apparently the spoils of `Operation Cut and Snip' were ending up in the Library. Stepping onto the third level, the pair navigated through ever larger piles of junk and old magazines, including, incredibly, a crumbling issue of Popular Electronics from 1968, the title do-it-yourself construction project: \"Build your own Theremin!\" Hanson bent down and picked up an old yellowed paperback book titled \"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\" The book randomly fell open to a page which read,\n\"By the end of September 1944, some seven and a half million civilian foreigners were toiling for the Third Reich. Nearly all of them had been rounded up by force, deported to Germany in boxcars, usually without food or water or any sanitary facilities and were put to work in the factories, fields and mines. They were not only put to work but degraded, beaten and starved and often left to die for lack of food, clothing and shelter.\"\nHmm. Try as you might, you can never predict the past with much accuracy.\nThe monkey hissed impatiently. Hanson dropped the book and followed it into a corridor that once held the office suite for the Library staff. The randomly dispersed junk contained piles of old black-and-white TV's, `all in one' stereos, including 8-track, and old yellowed book pages. At last Hanson was led to a room containing several beaten old oak desks and book shelves lined with many bits of flotsam and jetsam. On one of the desks an old soldering iron was burning. A radio was quietly blasting out the 5th movement of Philip Glass's `Satyagraha'. The acrid smell of burning solder, old tube electronics burning red-hot, and burning coffee grinds was music to Hanson's nose. A figure seated with his back to the door, silver hair spilling past shirt collar, suddenly swung around to face a shocked Hanson.\n\"Dr. Owen! I thought you were dead!\"\nvi. xinitrc\ndefault NeWS = talk.eliza.net\nFrom:\nPrison.net;section=info.crime.felonius;status=limited\n\"I think the one thing that really pushed me over the edge was all these old people telling me how I should help people who were less fortunate than I was. But I would be the one showing up at their house with a truck and some tools and telling them to join me `cause some friends and I were going to help a couple of families fix up their houses. But these old dudes would be sitting at their computers saying, `no, I can't, I've got to finish this social services grant application.' They would apply for money that would let them do studies \"On the root causes of poverty among the poor.\" And I'd say shit, we already know why they're poor. And they would get twisted out of shape because I didn't join their cause, and they thought the best way I could help the poor was to sit at some desk filling out their paperwork. That really got to me. All these hypocrites telling me that by spending all day writing on 8-1\/2 by 11 sheets of paper they're helping the poor. You know what's really sick? That guy who stands behind the counter handing out free food, and these so-called crusaders won't invite him to their parties cause he's not really doing important work. I'll take one of those food counter guys over ten of them any day. Man, these older guys talk a good talk, but when it comes time to do any real work, like helping build a clinic downtown, they're off at one of their congratulation dinners, and if they're not at one of these dinners, they're off zonked in front of the tube watching some show telling them how `significant' they are.\"\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\"Well, you couldn't help the poor then, not legally and in the way you wanted to cause you had to get permits and write all this shit. So I started saying this phrase to workers my age which went:\n`The next time they tell you to pick up a pen, pick up a hammer.' And everyone knew that it meant to stop doing the paperwork bullshit and start doing something with your hands and your tools.\"\n\"And then what happened?\"\n\"Well, The Information Crimes Division of the Secret Service arrested me for `promoting lawlessness and destruction.' I had this BBS that you could log into to exchange info on places that needed help. And at my court trial they claimed I was promoting anarchy.\"\n\"Were you?\"\n\"Man, the anarchy was already there long before I showed up. We were just trying to divert the stream of bad anarchy into the stream of good anarchy. You know, the kind you can live with and feel good about.\"\nrun pgm\nsymbolic analysis=12% time spent: years=15 subject not rehabilitated request for parole denied close\nlogout\n\"After awhile I started to realize that there were three Newsgroups that I went to first: alt.cyberpunk, sci.virtual-worlds, and soc.culture.brazil. Somehow these three groups read together give off a strange synergy that cannot be seen individually.\"\n-- The Author\n\"Picture if you will, a giant bubble over 100 billion light years in radius. We, on Earth, are at the center of this bubble. When we start to look out over the expanse of this bubble, we see that the further a galaxy is from us, the more its light has shifted into the red part of the light spectrum. Because we seek to explain the origin of the universe in a way that resembles our everyday physical reality, we say that the red shift is proof that all matter in the universe is hurtling from a central point; this Doppler shift is to us proof that the universe was created from some ancient Big Bang.\nBut we look closer at the situation and see many strange paradoxes. As an example, our instruments tell us that the Universe is humming with the background radiation left over from the Big Bang. When we look closer at what the source of this radiation is, is it possible that these extreme low frequencies are themselves the images of galaxies whose red-shifts are so extreme that they are detectable only as low-frequency radiation? And as this background radiation is detectable from all sides, can this not be caused by the large number of galaxies laying beyond the bubble of visibility of which the Earth is at the center?\nOur astronomers tell us that the visible universe accounts for only 10 percent of the matter that can be detected. Can this other 90 percent also consist of those galaxies whose red-shift is so extreme that their images cannot be resolved?\nBut the greatest issue that comes under scrutiny is this: that the very motion which is said to be proof of the motion caused by the Big Bang is the doppler shift held detectable by the red-shift.\nLadies and Gentlemen, we have, through close physical scrutiny of the universe and through our new space based telescope, uncovered irrefutable proof that the red-shift is not a Doppler shift, but a shift in the wavelength of light itself as it crosses the vast distances of the Universe. The massive gravitational force of the Universe itself causes light to shift into the red spectrum over a prescribed distance. True to the original theory of Einstein, this shift is caused by the topology of a closed universe which refracts light in the same way that a spoon viewed in a glass of water appears to have a bent handle. It is a form of gravitational refraction that cause the frequencies of light to shift toward the red. When we on the Earth look at a galaxy many billions of light years away, we see a galaxy whose light frequency waves have been physically slowed down by the effect of crossing our great sea of matter. Likewise, someone on that particular galaxy looking at our Milky Way would see that same red-shift. Formerly, scientists maintained that this universal red-shift existed because the universe expanded at such an immense and uniform speed that all forms of matter accelerated from each at the same shift.\nWe can now feel confident to say that the background radiation is caused by the uncountable seas of galaxies beyond our so called visible Universe affected by this principle. In centuries past, scientists said that it was impossible for the Universe to be infinite because at night we would look into a blindingly bright sky. Because of our new principle, we can say that it is possible for the Universe to be infinite; beyond 100 billion light years, the light and energy of the stars becomes so shifted that we no longer see or detect them. It is this model that we now prefer over the \"Big Bang\" theory. As for the creation of matter itself, one can now argue that if the \"Big Bang\" was needed as point from which matter was created, it is just as acceptable to believe that matter arose from an infinite amount of points in space arising from the turbulent quantum fabric of the Universe itself.\"\n-- Lecture given after the Nobel prize in Physics award given to Paulo\nMorais for his publication and verification of the Theory of Electrodynamic Entropy\nPaulo Morais stepped onto the gangplank that separated the office dome from the scientific complex. The plank was usually off limits for safety reasons, but Morais had a universal key. Besides taking a much needed short-cut, the key allowed him to feel for himself just how efficient the space cooling effect was. Inside the dome there was a fairly light breeze, upper 70's, normal humidity. Pressing the key into the lock and onto the outside of the dome caused a heat blast of warm, moist upper 90's Amazon Jungle air. Morais crossed the twenty feet into the next dome and looked upward to admire the superconductive webbing that ran from strut to strut inside the geodesic structure. One of the many discoveries of room temperature superconductivity was the space cooling effect. Woven strands of conducting fiber into a mosquito net pattern and apply current. Water in the air immediately condenses on the web and runs off at the bottom. In a dome, the sudden condensation creates a cool blanket of dehumidified air that sinks to the floor. In the sweltering heat of the Amazon, the domes made living and working inside a pleasant experience.\nMorais entered his lab. A young Yanomami Indian looked up from a stack of papers and said, \"Bom Dia, Herr Professor!\"\nMorais studied the youth quietly. \"Now don't tell me you're trying to learn Portuguese.\"\n\"Nah. I think I'll stick to learning how to speak English with a thick Russian accent.\"\n\"Did you ever find out what `Wilco' means?\"\n\"Like in `Roger Wilco' and `A-OK'? I think the two terms are interchangeable. I don't know why someone would say `Wilco' by itself.\"\n\"If it's just more slang, don't bother to transcribe it.\"\nMorais and his assistant had inherited a huge pile of documents that were sold to the Brazilian government by an Icelandic salvage operation. As a favor to the Amazonian Technical Institute, Morais offered to interpret the meaning behind many old stacks of documents that described the rise and fall of the American space program.\n\"You know, Dar. This makes for rather depressing reading. Sort of like reading how the Romans built the world's most elaborate sewers and aqueducts and then a couple of centuries down the road deciding that its not even worth the bother to take a bath anymore.\"\nMorais' watch beeped a few times. \"Paulo. Get over to Barlow's office right away. They have some news about the Brother Jimmers that you're going to find really interesting.\"\n\"The Boom-era damage has been particularly severe among the hardest-pressed 13ers. The gap between the young rich and the young poor, bridgeable for the Boomers, has become a yawning canyon. Minority-group claims have lost much of their `60s-era luster and leadership. Inner cities, then perceived as morally solid and economically improving, are now social Dresdens of ruined families, gang crime, and sudden death. Boomer teens who got in trouble heard political leaders call for social services; 13ers who get in trouble mainly hear calls for boot-camp prisons - or swift execution.\"\n-- Neil Howe and Bill Strauss, 13th Gen.- Abort, Retry, Fail?\nopen line 12\nexecute data link\n300 baud cache and forward\n1700 KHz rider signal\n`O.K. O.K. That was the `Who' won't get fooled again. Won't Get Fooled Again. Sorry. I keep having to remember to `Capitalize All Proper Names'. You are connected to the voice of Hogger Radio.\nHogger Radio. Coming to you from the voice of Free Colorado. Free Colorado, where no man is in debt. Had to give a plug. A gentle listener wrote in (sorry again, I can't receive snail mail) askin' \"Hogger\" Why do you often sound so bad?' and I have to say back tha this is a 65 in 1 electronics kit from Radio Shack, and I'm patched into a satellite by God knows what type of wire. But they keep me on the air cause I'm the only one who knows how to talk to the right people and let them talk. That's right. I listen to them and they vibrate my ear drums. And my eardrums vibrate a micro-microphone that gets get decompressed over a... well you get the idea. I don't always. But you get to hear good talk. And I always love what I'm hearin'. And I get a letter (remember, I can't get letters) but I know someone wants to know: Hogger, when you sound so bad, how can I make you sound better? Well, easy, son. You get an old wire coat hanger and you stick it on the end of that old crystal set that Big Burger Fun Meal for the month of August told you how to build out of old scrap radio parts. And you take the hanger and pull it out so it looks real square, and when you're listenin' to Hogger its goin' to sound so much better, cause that old coat hanger hooks up real nice to the 1700 Kilohertz wave that I'm a trying to blast out of my eardrums.\nAnd I'm here in my mobile studio, which is nothing more than little ol' me and I'm sitting at a bar stool, and if you listen real hard, and you used that little coat hanger trick I told you about, you can hear the pool sticks and waitresses clinking glasses. I can't tell you where I am, cause we have to be real secret about this. Some of you who are listening might think this is really illegal, and sure enough, just a couple of ya have been paid to find out where we are and come after us and give us the ol' deep six, so all I'm going say is that we're in a bar that gets real busy in the ski season and has the best suds this ol' dude has ever tasted. But enough talk. I'm here in the old back room with none other than Bobby DelRay. You know who is he is. Bobby likes to ski and has a kind of reckless streak in `im and so when I walks up to hims and say \"How you like to be on the old Hogger show?\" this ageing rebel couldn't pass it up.\n\"Bobby, how ya doin'!\"\n\"Pretty good. I guess.\"\n\"Now let me ask you. The New York Times once called you `The First Rebel of America's Second Civil War.' How does that make you feel.\"\n\"Nothing much, I guess. I'm here in beautiful Colorado, and that's what counts.\"\n\"Now you were a part of the Great Kentucky Fried Hamburger Rebellion of 2005. Can you fill us in on what happened then?\"\n\"Well, Joe. Joe? I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to call you Joe. But anyway, I was only in high school back then.\"\n\"And what was going on then?\"\n\"Well. I was, as you know, living in southern Ohio. And me and most of my school buddies worked odd jobs to get whatever money we could back in those scarce days.\"\n\"Things pretty tough, huh?'\n\"Oh yeah. Anyway, I was working at a place called Big Burger, and some kids I knew then worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Shop-N-Go, and a bunch of other food type jobs. And as you can guess, things were real bad, cause the state had been given the go ahead to lower the minimum wage on account of the hard times.\"\n\"And how much was that?\"\n\"I know we made $5.00 an hour for awhile, but that was when we were real lucky. The state then lowered the minimum to what they called a $3.35 an hour `business hardship' wage, which you know, back in 2005 was really bad. The state also had some law that said you could require a worker to stay longer than 40 hours a week and not have to pay them. Something called `a competitive labor overhead reduction.' We were real pissed and called relatives to see if anything outside of Ohio was better, but it seemed like everyone you called was in the same boat.\"\n\"Were there any other jobs?\"\n\"Not really. My old man had been laid off from a machine shop that specialized in overseas CNC contracts. But the factory got bought up by someone who laid everyone off. We found out it was one of those things where a competitor buys the factory just to eliminate the competition. My dad was kind of lucky though. He headed straight home as soon as the overseas owner laid everyone off. Joe Gullwright was not lucky. He and about twelve other men took rifles and tried to take over the place. They stayed there for 3 days, and you know, not even twelve men can keep up a good guard shift for 3 days straight. So at the night of the third day a bomb got lobbed into the machine shop and everyone was gone at that point. My parents said be careful, just do everything they say right now.\"\n\"And you did nothing?\"\n\"At that point, everyone agreed that we should just stick to our jobs and just keep our ears peeled. We had word that anyone trying to leave town got arrested. And they got arrested by these company security police types. When we contacted the county sherriff's office, we got some type of recorded message that they were no longer in service. My dad and the mayor try to get through to Mark Thompson's house to see if he was still working for the sherriff's office, but we got his wife who said that Mark had been taken to a state training center in the middle of the night, and she was sick worried cause Mark said he wasn't allowed to call or write or until after he had completed his special training. We were all taking mental notes at that time, and we didn't like what we saw. I was still able to sneak home enough French Fries and burgers that my family didn't starve though.\"\n\"And speaking of starve, I heard you really had some food problems.\"\n\"Oh yeah. Everyone on our block had gotten together to get all the lawns turned into gardens, and since it was July we had finally gotten some food. And one Sunday, when I finally could take off some time from Big Burger, I was out in the garden watering everything from an illegal tap I made in the ground cause they had shut off our house water. Anyway, this lady drives up in a really fancy sports car, like a black German Porsche, the kind we never get to see in southern Ohio. And she steps out, and she's really young and pretty, maybe 25. And she gets out and looks at everything with this scowl on her face, and I'm sure it looked like hell, cause we had piles of dirt everywhere and had fenced in a couple of goats to a side pen and a had a couple of chicken wandering in and out of the house. And she walks up to ask me if I live here, and she tells me that she is in charge of the real estate development association and I ask what does that have to do with us? and she says everything, since the county approved her company buying up the houses on our block and that we had two months to move out, and in the mean time, it was illegal to do anything to the lawns and house without their permission.\"\n\"Whew. You must have pissed!\"\n\"Hell ya! The next day we tried to get to the bottom of things, but it was the same story for everyone. The county assessor's office had been purchased by a multinational firm, but you could never find out who was in charge.\"\n\"Didn't you ever try to call out state to get help?\"\n\"Try? Ya! But the phones had this strange problem. You could call long distance only if you had an account with a long distance company. If you tried to get more details, like `Can I make this call and charge it to my bank account or regular long-distance provider?' they would either get pissed or tell you some gobbledygook about \"We can not help toll customers who do not have an account.\" If you asked for details on how to get an account, you heard stuff about how you had to have an account to get an account. Garbage like that. Bif had a ham radio and he came up to us one night after I had a fight with the new Big Burger manager who was this 14-year-old kid who knew nothing about how to do anything and got really pissed if you talked to him. Anyway Bif is talking to us and it's a beautiful night and the fireflies on the grass are making the stars look like they're coming down from the sky, and I can tell by Bif's voice that something's up, and he tells us that when he tries to contact someone on the ham radio no one responds, and there's no one talking. And he only listens now cause he's afraid something out there is got the people who were talking. But he doesn't hear anyone from Ohio.\"\n\"But he must have picked up other states?\"\n\"Oh yeah. But for some reason, almost all the eastern U.S. was silent. He would hear from time to time someone saying \"Anyone out there? Please respond.\" But Bif said he could tell it wasn't a real ham radio operator and that it might be a trap. He also picked up some stuff from way West, but real hard to understand. Kind of cryptic, mostly numbers, like that strange voice that used to recite a bunch of numbers in Florida, but no one could tell what they were for. Bif heard a couple of sentences once, though, like: \"I can see how many tanks they have.\" and \"Make sure they bury the lines.\"\n\"Tell us about Samson.\"\n\"Marty Samson owned the gas station on the main drive, and just like everyone else, like Vernon Smith who had to sell Big Burger to the 14 year old snot, Marty was broke and had to sell out to these mysterious company folk who had just moved into town. Anyway, Marty says one night he was working, they hired him to be manager, and he sees this big truck move in for a tank of diesel. But the front of it looks real strange. And of all things, the truck is yelling at him, \"Please put in the nozzle.\"!?! Jeez. The truck is talking to Marty and tells him to accept a credit card, and Marty makes sure it's legit and the truck is legit. Well, I read Popular Science when it gets left behind in town, and I now start to piece things together. This is one of those `fuzzy-logic' trucks that everyone is writing about since they can work 24 hours a day and get through their route much faster and safer.\"\n\"And what about high-school? Oh. Excuse me. Just bring another pitcher.\"\n\"I was getting to that. So I'm back at school which is only 4 hours a day because the district went broke and the teachers are volunteer, and we can get more work in anyways, when Bart Studer calls all of us in from a beautiful sunny day where we have somehow gotten an old frisbee and are playing a game of Guts and we are yelling `Shit. Now they're going to tell us they can't afford to let us have a goddam frisbee'. So we get hustled into the old basketball gym and Bart is looking real nervous and we all feel sorry for him, cause who would take on the hassle of being Principle for no pay. After about 10 minutes all the students are in the seats and under the backboard is this big guy who is wearing a black pin-striped suit, and he has blond hair and a really deep tan, not some farmer tan like we got.\"\n\"And I'll bet he had quite a speech to give you guys.\"\n\"More like the most bizarre bullshit I ever heard in my life. Anyway, everyone was real silent, cause all the families had been having all this strange stuff happening and we knew this guy was connected to it somehow.\"\nDisconnect Notice\n1700 KHz Jamming alert\nSee Big Burger VeggieGulp Wrapper Month of May for New Time and Frequency\nTo continue above audio mail append message tag #1120-1 part 2.

Newsweek, October, 1998.\nThe U.S. Marshal's Office has just granted broad, discretionary powers to the Software Printer's Association, a company started in the 1980's which claimed to represent the copyright interests of software manufacturers. The company has engaged in quasi-legal actions which included threatening to take a company to court for using unlicensed software and pocketing the out of court settlement for itself. Alfred Milbourne, then President of Digiscript Inc., described a typical scenario:\n\"You would see posters with pictures of two of our product, and some logo reading `The One on the Right just cost someone $500,000,' and it would be a picture of one of our own Digiscript floppies. The ad would then go on to state that you could send in $80 to get a copy of their pirate software detector, which in reality was nothing more than a batch file which listed all the executable files on your hard disk!\"\nMilbourne went on to list the contents of some of the lurid press releases put out by the SPA, including accounts of how some of the biggest ringleaders in software piracy were being put away for years in Federal Penitentiaries. Milbourne's own legal staff eventually looked into the matter:\n\"We found out that the SPA would call up a company and in effect tell it that they had heard that employees were using pirated software and that they would have to submit themselves to an `audit' or else face a raid by the U.S. Marshal's Office. They would then visit the office and find that, lo and behold, someone was using a duplicate copy of our Digiscript program. Depending on how gullible the company president was, the SPA would then shake down the company for tens of thousands of dollars to prevent them from being taken to court in order to extract `compensatory damages.' We found out that our product was often the lynch-pin behind these extortions, yet, believe it or not, we never saw a penny from the SPA!\"\nSPA efforts to act as a quasi-official organ of the government have finally paid off: starting this year the SPA will be able to use its own security and policing staff to raid companies under suspicion. The U.S. Attorney's office has given the SPA the authority to search and seize all computer equipment which may be suspected of harboring pirated software. This means that any SPA employee can now walk into your company and snag that attractive looking hypercube that took you months to get a hold of. Suspicion is all that is needed! Attorney General Gregory Lucas upon being questioned about the SPA had this to say:\n\"I don't know much about this computer stuff, you know, bits and bytes and all that crap, but I do know this! If we let pirates run free in this society it will be the end of American civilization as we know it. I am proud that someone like the SPA has seen fit to go mano a mano against these pirates and they will continue to have my support as well as my authority to conduct raids under the deputization powers of my office.\"\nSPA publications can now be found in most schools, as well as videos starring rap music superstar D.J. saran-rap-gangsta, just released from prison, rapping the SPA's snappy jingle `Don't archive that computer file in an unauthorized manner!'\nWormwood II, April, 2001\nArthur Hanson stood in front of Dr. Jarod Owen, not quite sure of what to say.\nOwen barked, \"Grab a seat, Dr. Hanson! Fill me in on what you've been up to these last five years!\" Good, nothing out of the ordinary. Hanson slumped back into a decrepit office chair that groaned from the impact of his spine against the seatback.\n\"Doc, maybe I'm out of it, but what the hell am I doing here? One day I'm rambling around the Wurkhaus camp system and the next I find that I'm a new prof here.\"\n\"Rambling around the camp system for five years.\" Owen shook his head sadly, but retained the twinkle in his eyes that betrayed an endless font of energy. \"Let's both start from the beginning. Now since it's a surprise to you that I'm still alive, I can only assume that you thought that I died in the attack along with a great number of people. For a long time I certainly thought the same of you.\"\nHanson looked up at the water stained ceiling. \"I was here for at least six months after the bombs were dropped. One of the steam tunnels under the Student Union led to a suite of storerooms. About 150 of us were able to hide out there. Hotter than fresh roof tar in August. We figured that it was at least 130 degrees for two or three days from the fires. Lucky for us the store room was deep enough in the earth for us to survive in.\"\n\"What did you do about food and water?\" asked Owen.\n\"Oh, that lasted about 4 months; a huge case of Spam lasted about a month, too. I don't think my digestive track ever recovered from that culinary adventure. When we ran out of food, we started scouting around up top. When I got caught by one of the GermanMetalFuzz, I...\"\n\"German what?\" interrupted Owen.\n\"The German Motorized Infantry Security Police. I convinced him that if he helped us find food we would make it worth his while. The Fuzz got a load of about 200 college dorm mini-fridges right before his boss nabbed him. We stripped this campus dry from the bottom up for whatever we could find. Light bulbs, blankets, hell, even those awful cafeteria trays were in big demand.\"\n\"I hear that Central Services is still bitchin' about the trays,\" laughed Owen.\n\"Naturally we just didn't have enough to barter with anymore. A new law that allowed the Fuzz to pack people up to camps if they didn't have a home just went into effect, and most of us got rounded up and sent north. I was shipped to Wurkhaus 211 at the intersection of Highway 12 and 93.\"\n\"First Service Motors?\" asked Owen.\n\"Was then, only now it's the chief autotruck production plant in Michigan for the German Army. I was sent to live with an assembly line gang that packed the trucks as they were being sent to the Mississippi River war zone. Fortunately for me I got pulled off the line and placed in detention to await interrogation. When I got taken to the interview room down the cell hall I was strapped into a chair, and told that I would be interrogated by a Major Schulmann.\"\n\"And this was fortunate?\" Owen asked.\n\"Well, I didn't think so at the time. But Schulmann came into the room and asked me all sorts of questions, so naturally I told him what I was doing here at Central, and he got real upset and started yelling to someone on the phone in German, which I could barely understand, but I got the sense that he was yelling at one of the Fuzz about treating me badly and why was I taken here in the first place. The guards then took me outside. They were really nice to me all of sudden, giving me food cards and cigarettes. I was taken to a big house where I could see what the change of attitude was about.\"\n\"Which was?\"\n\"Everything that you could possibly imagine going wrong in a computerized office. Equipment hooked up the wrong way, operators not saving their files, no documentation, wall outlets that looked like they were sprouting octopuses, a big list of information age no-nos. I found out within the week that Schulmann had been put on notice to organize the warehouse office or else be transferred to the Iranian front.\"\n\"Your first job in the real world!\" Owen quipped sarcastically.\n\"The computers were the easy part. The logistics were a little tougher, because, in essence, I had to figure out how the German Army could transfer goods in and out of Michigan by way of our warehouse in such a way that losses were minimized.\"\n\"Losses?\"\n\"Oh yeah. Everywhere. I can tell you for sure that not a single box of Cinnamon Pop-tarts has ever made it to the River zone. Unopened boxes of those things command a pretty high price on the black market. Schulmann was savvy enough to understand what I was talking about. I showed him how to disguise shipments by using digit flipping bookkeeping and key authorized database records stored on the autotrucks. He was a real happy guy after a while. Both he and his upper echelon got promoted up the ladder to a military post somewhere in Kansas. The warehouse was then sold to the Brother Jims at a profit.\"\n\"Ooh, boy. The Jims.\"\n\"I barely managed to escape the day the Jims were surrounding the place with poison barbed wire. Schulmann probably told the Jims that I went with the purchase. Bastard. Ever since then I've been roaming the area doing whatever I can to survive in the winter months and leading the slacker lifestyle when the weather gets warm.\"\n\"Which brings us up to the point in your story when you mysteriously show up on the IMF's labor invoice database.\" Owen squirmed uneasily in his chair. He had a huge favor to ask of Hanson. One that in all probability would cost Arthur his life.\nDataflage Corporation has just announced a new line of lap-top computers meant to prevent seizure by the Software Printer's Association, whose plainclothes operatives have been known to hide out in airports where travelers carry a large selection of portables on their business trips.

If he had to make a special trip from the moon, something is up. Here, put my watch on; that should foil the office pager. I'm going to run into Ivari's office and see if I can watch this drama take place from behind.\"\nDar Im-Tula took the watch-com from Morais and placed it on his wrist. Dar was one of the rare Indian programmers who allowed himself to be called by name. Among the Yanomami it was usually considered an insult to call someone by their name. It took Morais several years to understand the Yanomami mind, but for his efforts he was paid off in two ways: he was allowed the privilege to address Dar by his phonetic label, and he had access to the most gifted pool of computer talent on the planet. His colleagues were not so lucky. Being less understanding types, they would often hear of the legendary computer prowess of the Yanomami and then `hire' them for programming projects at the Institute. The managers of these projects would invite the Yanomami to Project Meetings, speaking of deadlines, product deliveries dates, work schedules, and salaries. The `employed' Amazon Tribe member would then be shown to a cubicle and asked to show up at 8:00 the next morning. The results would be disastrous. The new employee would never show up on time, sometimes as late as 4:00 in the afternoon. A project manager might be eating dinner on his screened-in porch at home and look up to see the employee seated across from him, after somehow slipping silently in, all eager to discuss the project. To make things worse, they would never give out their names, and refused to sign any paperwork, saying that a salary was unimportant, yet showing up at night, asking to borrow the water sled, because they had to visit an uncle for the next two weeks, and then returning two months later without the sled because it had been given away during a festival. Most managers went apoplectic over this sort of behavior, resolving never to hire the Yanomami ever again, but having no qualms about cannibalizing whatever juicy bits of Yanomami code appeared on the public nets. Morais, however, took a different approach.\nTen years before, when a knotty problem concerning the Space Construction Platform had Morais up for nights, Morais looked up tired from his terminal to see that a Yanomami Indian was standing silently next to him. He muttered \"Can I sit down?\" Morais was too tired to protest and gave him his chair. Within 4 hours the unknown Yanomami had entirely re-written the emergent behavior algorithm that allowed the robots to return to their fuel tanks without losing the timing involved in rolling out the steel sheet involved in the beam formation process at the Platform. After several debugging run-throughs, the gentle face of the ageless appearing tribesman looked up at Morais and muttered \"Remember that the Ant gives his legs to the Colony before he moves his own body.\" The Amazon silently disappeared leaving behind a perplexed Morais. But later, when the Platform started receiving steel shipments from Earth, the meaning behind the Yanomami's words hit Morais. Not quite able to express it in words, Morais was nonetheless able to give the Russian Draftsman the complete proposal for the Mars Launch Program. Every time the project slowed down, the same thing would happen. At the back of the meeting room, when the managers conference had descended into bickering, a lone individual would silently appear. Morais would then silence the proceedings and ask to hear what the Yanomami had to say. The words would always have a cryptic but homespun tribal sound to them. Sometimes they elicited laughter from the project leaders, who were surprised to find the Indian laughing along with them. But it would always happen. Four hours later. Two days later. Two weeks later. Morais would be thinking about the words muttered at the proceedings and would have a flash of inspiration which would take him running to the Russian Draftsman's lab. The Draftsman's hard-headed genius for all things mechanical usually meant that any idea remotely unsound was met with a disparaging wave of the hand and complete ignorance of the messenger. But with Morais it would be different. The Draftsman would gently nod his head yes, and turn away to furiously sketch something on an old, battered artist's sketch pad. In five years, this strange, triple collaboration allowed Morais to advance to the Project Head for Manned Space Exploration of the Amazonian Technical Institute, a position which brought much fame, from all over the world, as well as inside the Brazilian Empire. But for the Yanomami, it would always be the same. An individual, a brother, a cousin, perhaps would show up at your house: Can I borrow this laptop? My Grandfather wants to keep track of the number of Dolphins in the River. My third cousin from up North is starting classes, can he stay at your house for awhile? Can I sit down? The program would work much better if you did this...\nHow to Protect Yourself in the 21st Century\nwith a new introduction by\nGeneral Buford Keegan\nLadies and Gentlemen. It has been over ten years since I have been directly involved in the production of the volume that you now hold in your hands. When Roberto DelReyes, the chief author of this book's current edition approached me about writing a new introduction, I could not refuse. After all, it was Roberto himself who conceived the idea for this book when almost twenty years ago such information was not commonplace. It was, after all, twenty years ago that Roberto's involvement in a brave and daring plan to evacuate the town of Riverside, Ohio that made it possible for me to continue the work of ensuring that men everywhere have the choice of remaining and acting as free and responsible citizens of this great planet of ours. Roberto's questions continuously assured me that even in an age like ours, any one possessed of a good mind and free heart could understand the most knotty questions involved in resisting a high-technology dictatorship, in whatever form it took. I have gained great strength from knowing that in such chaotic circumstances such as ours, basic common sense is all that is needed in order to understand such topics as `how to write a trojan virus' or `what behavior is appropriate under infrared surveillance.'\nThat we live in difficult times, times that often more closely resemble the civil war of the 1860s' than the high-tech paradise of the 1950's, when it was thought that all that was needed to survive a nuclear war were lead impregnated bib-overalls, is quite obvious. You are now holding in your hands a very special volume. A volume that is only three by five inches, and whose cover reads `Charts and Tables of Standards for Weights and Measures Used Under the English System of Measurement.' By camouflaging our book in this way, we have practically assured that very few people will willingly open up its cover for fear of the tedious and boring content suspected of lurking on its pages. Yet the cover also indicates that this volume has an inherent usefulness that prevents it from being thrown out, and indeed, will often cause those being sent this volume to place it on an esteemed roost on a bookshelf without the cover ever being opened. In this way, our manual has spread into all corners of society, and many of those in the East who seek our information have only to visit a library reference section to find it. Many techniques like the one I just described are found in the pages of this book.\nThose of us involved in the production of this volume have had many labels thrown at us: Terrorist, criminal, revolutionary, and even Communist, even when the techniques in this book help defend the individual against Communist oppression as well as any other. We do not subscribe to labels of any kind. As we look back into the twentieth century, we can only see that labels, no matter how well intentioned, eventually turn into oppressive straight-jackets. Rather than labels, we hold the radical viewpoint that individuals are much better able to determine their own destinies than outside organizations. The purveyor of these organizational modes of living constantly accuse of pedaling death in our philosophy as we propose the death of the organization. But we ask those who seek to erase our existence a continual question: when in our history has the individual ever benefitted from allegiance to the organization? An example often put forth is the defeat of Adolf Hitler during World War II (according to Western U.S. history). Evidence has shown time and time again that the defeat of Nazi Germany arose from individuals who only temporarily chose to act as a collective. When the need for such a collective passed, those who chose to prop it by via organizational and extra-individual means bought about the debacle of Vietnam, an event so humiliating to contemplate that it has now been excised from Eastern U.S. textbooks. Because of these views we have been accused of being pessimistic and destructive to the true cause of human nature. Quite the contrary is true. We have an unflagging optimism in the Human Spirit. We are products of at least 3 billion years of biological evolution, and when such a grand creation chooses to hold opinion as to whether such a war is wrong or such a government is corrupt, it does good to listen to it. To believe that one's own individual instincts are somehow inferior to those of the Nation State or other extra-individual entity, is to invite disaster as those of us who live the Eastern United States can now readily attest. We live in radically dangerous times that call for a new form of resistance. Those of us who have access to an uncensored history of the last century have seen the same mistake happen over and over again: that is, to defend yourself against your enemy, you must defeat your enemy; to defeat your enemy, you must become your enemy, and in the process, lose what it is you were trying to defend. We have resolved not to make this mistake. Our enemies are those who say that they must capture us in order that we may be reintegrated into their collective, a collective made up of mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, violence and the adoration of a group of corrupt, senile old men whose only achievements in life have been to hold large buckets under the money faucets of the Federal Reserve Bank. Our enemies have been coming after us with guns, planes, and tanks, yet, in all cases, we have been able to defeat them on our own territory, without having to recourse to their weapons-based methods. You will find our methods in this book. Our methods are faster, cheaper, and more effective than theirs. Our method relies on something far cheaper and deadlier than clunky military hardware and dangerous explosives. Our method relies on Information. And it is with Information and little else that will enable you to single-handedly disarm a tank or cause an enemy soldier to retreat to his homeland. Our method is the most effective of all in that it directs the strength of your enemy back upon himself.\nBack in the dark ages of the 1980's the Reagan Administration chose to go to war against the peasants of Nicaragua so that corporate shareholders could realize more profits from the sale of military hardware. At that time, it was difficult to kill a peasant and his children; the soldier most likely had a family of his own, and was remiss to take such action. However, just by muttering one word: \"Communists!\" the same soldier could easily destroy an entire village. That my friends, was the power of Information. To survive in the Twenty-First you will have to learn how to use Information as a weapon, and you will have to learn how the enemy is determined to use Information as a weapon against you, and take the necessary steps to defend yourself.\nI wish you the best of luck in all your endeavors,\nGeneral Keegan\nDurango, Mexico, May, 2025\nTable of Contents\np. iv Preface to the English System of Measurement\np. 10 Thread Diameter Conversion Scales\np. 123 An In-Depth Discussion of Atomic Weight Classification Schemes\np. 150 Metric Conversion Charts (Ed.

Sec. 706 (1) A license is required for the commercial use of virtual reality technology for entertainment or purposes other then bona fide education, training, research, and development.\nWhere VR is defined:\nNEW SECTION. Sec 702. (4) ``Virtual Reality\" means any computer or other electronic technology that creates an enhanced illusion of three-dimensional, real-time or near-real-time interactive reality through the use of software, specialized hardware, holograms, gloves, masks, glasses, computer guns, or other item capable of producing visual, audio, and sensory effects of verisimilitude beyond those available with a personal computer.\nMy friend was present at the hearing of a portion of this bill. Evidently, the person backing the bill, Senator Phil Talmadge, and his crew are convincing the State Congress that VR will permit \"a realistic illusion of killing another person and such an illusion will make it easier for someone to go out and actually commit such a crime outside of VR.\" The State Congress has a very short calendar this year. This matter could be voted on as early as next week (week of 14 February 94), and the congressional session ends 8 March 1994, so this could be voted into law in less than one month.\nSenator Phil Talmadge (206) 786-7436 Leading the opposition: Senator Sheldon (206) 786-7644\nSenate Fax: (206) 786-1999.

Fantastic. I keep tellin' them that my pager doesn't always work, but lucky for you good listeners, you ain't gonna miss a lick of my show. Hogger Radio. That's me. And Hogger remembers that some of you is curious as to how Hogger gets out the way he does. You may remember that because of an accident long ago Hogger had his eardrums taken out and replaced with what are called `cochlear transducers' which means for you folks that all I need is a wire attached the right way and somehow I can get what I hear in my own head broadcast out by a semi full of old radio gear that calls itself Radio Free Colorado and has to travel a lot to avoid detection by a vigilante squad. But I keep hearing that Hogger radio is so popular that me and RFC are going to keep at it for as long as our Eastern brothers are still in chains, come Hell or high water.\n\"Like we was hearing just a few minutes ago, that legendary rebel Bobby DelRay ran into ol' Hogger enjoying the end of the ski season on the mountain, and Hogger just couldn't pass up an opportunity to ask him what happened twenty years ago in the Great Kentucky Fried Hamburger rebellion and Bobby agreed, so long as yours truly springs for the beer.\n\"Now Bobby, you was tellin' us that way back in high school you got called into the gym to get a talkin' to.\"\n\"Yep. All us students were together listening to this guy, O.K., and he tells us that he works for the IMF which is the International Monetary Fund. Now the IMF is a big bank that we didn't know much about, but this guy goes on to tell us that somehow this IMF has now become the largest bank in the United States and that just recently the Bank of the Federal Reserve of the United States of America has gone into what he called a `triple default;' that is, the government has been given three chances to pay some debts that is has owed, but has failed to come up with the money each time. He flipped out one of those laptop computers that gives off this bright light so that we could see the screen showing on the wall, and it's full of pie charts and other mumbo-jumbo. So naturally we wondered what the heck he was talkin' about.\n\"Eventually he tells us that the federal government has failed to institute an `austerity program' so that interest payments on the eight trillion dollar federal debt can be made in a more timely manner. He also tells, and this is real important, that in order to operate and remain `liquid,' the federal government has had to sell bonds to rich foreign dudes so that they can afford to pay the interest on the federal bonds that have been bought and sold outside the U.S.\"\n\"Sort of like taking out money on your credit card to pay off the interest on another credit card.\"\n\"Ya, if you can rack up eight trillion on your credit card. Don't quote me on this stuff; I'm sure I'm getting some of the facts wrong, but this is basically what I remember. Anyways he gets to the part that really affects us. He says that in order to pay off all our debts, which I guess included us so-called taxpayers, a group of banks had been authorized by the federal government to seize control of the assets of the U.S. government and that we would have to continue working and give over half of our earnings to what he called `major creditors' of the taxpayers of the U.S.\"\n\"Half? And you were making like three dollars an hour? I figure that would have netted you like $1.50 an hour.\"\n\"Try fifty cents an hour. It turned out that another foreign bank owned something called the Social Security Entitlement Corporation which by law could take out as much money from our paychecks as it wanted in order give its principal investors a steady return. Of course, when we retired we would get something, too, NOT. The whole thing was a Ponzi scheme, but it was the law, so what could you do? Anyway, the talk finally concludes away from all this stuff and gets to the heart of the matter. It turns out that because of something called the `Federal Domain,' all of our houses and all of the land has been sold to a group of banks in Europe and would be resettled by the new owners within a month, and we had only a few weeks to get everything together and move out. The guy in the gym was their representative and he flashes up a chart that tells us what we are going to have to do. Like all of our cars and TVs and cameras and stuff had also been bought up so we are going to have to leave them behind `in good condition,' We could only take the clothes on our backs and enough food and medicine that we could carry in our hands. Then it got really scary. `Martial law' or something like it had just been declared in our county which meant that we were under orders not to leave town until a truck came by our house that would take us to our new place of work.\"\n\"New place of work?\"\n\"Oh yeah. The foreign guy was now showing some film off of his laptop, and it's really old looking, kind like someone spliced together an old 16mm movie. And it shows all of these people in a big bunkhouse somewhere, and they're smiling and making beds and walking through gardens and collecting vegetables. And the guy continues talking, and says that a new federal law has just been passed which requires us to work, even if we have lost our homes and have no place to go, and that we would be given an interview to find out what our assignments were. Like, if you had some electrical work in your background you would be assigned to the military, but if you were some high-schoolers like us, you would be taken to a bunkhouse to work at some job and later, if your attitude was real good, you would be eligible for something called The Plan.\"\n\"The Plan?\"\n\"Yep. All we knew at the time was that it had something to do with that wacked out televangelist Brother Jim who was getting rich bilking old people out of their money. This was the first time we had heard that he was wrapped up in all this federal mess, and we was sure that he was making a mint off this, too. Made sense, though. This Jimbo character was on TV a lot, in one of those infomercials tellin' people how they could make a killing in Real Estate with such tactics like finding somebody who was having trouble making their house payments and walking in front of their house in the winter and falling and getting a lawyer to sue them for doctor bills and settling out of court for the title to the house. But a lot of people were like, `but Brother Jim is so good and wants to help America, we should listen to him, he is one of the great spiritual leaders of our time' and all that crap.\n\"Now you can be sure that some of the kids were real smart-asses upon hearing this, and a couple of them yelled out that they wouldn't leave. And then comes the Mark Shipman incident.\"\n\"Very famous incident indeed!\"\n\"Ya, Mark jumps up and starts yelling `My Dad says you're a bunch of Nazis and if you come anywhere near our house he's gonna pump you full of lead!' So the speaker's face gets real red and he steps outside for a moment and motions someone in, another guy with a pinstriped suit, only he's got some really small machine gun slung over his shoulder, and the speaker points his finger at Mark and the machine-gun guy writes something down and leaves. Right after that, we were lead out of the school yard by some other guys with guns and told that we couldn't return there anymore. Two days later there was a big fire a couple of blocks away. It was the Shipman house. Someone had lobbed a bomb into the house in the middle of the night. My parents had heard similar things like we did, only they were visiting the houses one by one while we were in school and posting guards at the end of the streets. Dad had been told that he would be checked on to make sure that nothing happened out of the ordinary. I still had to go to Big Burger to work, only now it was something like eighty hours a week, and we had cameras watching us. I tried to find out if I could stay at Big Burger while the town was being evacuated, but they said no. We were installing machines that would wait on customers and deliver their food to them much faster than we could, and was told that we would be gone in a couple of weeks as soon as the transition was completed. It was at this point that Bif started to play an important role in our lives.\"\n\"Now for our audience, explain just who Bif is today.\"\n\"Right now Bif, er, I mean General Keegan, is Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Mexico Defense Battery, and if you've been accessing the paper lately you know that we have him to thank for the recent defeat of the Aryan Nation attack on the state of Arizona. Back then, though, we had no idea. No idea at all what Bif was. You see, back in high school, Bif was what we called a `Hacker.' And in a small town like ours, being a hacker got you made fun of, big time. And Bif didn't have many friends, so he spent a heck of an amount of time in his uncle's basement, even when the weather was nice, doing God knows what with telephone wire and old game computers and broken CD recorders and whatever junk he could scrounge from his uncle's recently defunct radio repair business. Now, I didn't understand Bif very well, but we had become friends about a month before the infamous gym speech because he had stolen a password needed to operate the burger computer where I worked and showed me ho to scam food from the place. One night after I managed to sneak home, I got to talk to Bif after he snuck into our basement. He had some other guys our age follow him in and said that from now on we were going to hold regular meetings at three a.m. Boy did Bif change.\"\n\"Change?\"\n\"You had to have been there. He started showing us all these maps of the county, using terms like `Info-terrorism' and `Surveillance Weakness Zones.' Turns out that Bif was finally able to use the Ham radio after all. A group of hackers in Toledo had figured out a way to scramble the conversation and disguise it as white noise, something called `analog least-significant bit stegonography,' now don't ask me what that means. To decode the conversation, you had to know someone personally who would hand you the secret code. Then, any form of secret code, like PGP, had been made illegal, so Bif and his friends were really risking their lives.\n\"We talked very low, for hours, with me only understanding the gist of the matter, but come dawn I was officially a member of The Plan.\"\n\"The Plan?\"\n\"We adopted that Brother Jim crap as a code name for our own activities so that if someone overheard they wouldn't be able to guess what we were up to. Now Bif had formed some sort of a secret network, kind of like a `hacker patrol' that was going to strike back when the trucks arrived to take us away. You got to believe that back then, hackers striking back against those guys sounded way ridiculous, but for some crazy reason, I believed that Bif knew what he was talking about, and that he was our best chance for escaping this situation alive.\"\n\"Hmm, clarify to our audience why you used the word `alive'.\"\n\"Bif had found out through his network that cities all over the Eastern U.S. were having the same things happen to them. We didn't have phone service, newspapers, or anything coming into town that told us what was happening. If you watched TV, all you got was crap. Even the local station was showing nothing but those damned infomercials to prevent from going out of business. But Bif could get real news over his computer, which he had disguised to look like an old typewriter to prevent the SPA from nabbing it. Bif was learning about some real bad riots going on in Cleveland and Detroit. He even had some news about the trucks that were supposed to take us away. Well, it turns out that some of the trucks were actually being driven into large fenced-in areas where the cargo portions would be stacked on top of each other and the cab would unhook and drive off for its next load. As for jobs, only a small amount of those trucks would get driven into Michigan where they would drop off people to work at some real horrible slave labor jobs. Bif said he learned that the population of Ohio was considered to be `surplus' and that only those people who had skills were given real jobs. Of course, this was causing a lot of violence. And strange uniforms. It turns out that some of the European police who were being sent here to quell some of the riots were wearing a uniform adapted from a three-piece pin-striped suit, right down to a fake white boutonniere in the lapel. Of course, all us town folk had been forbidden to travel out of town, and this bought us time. They were working in a line running down the state, with our town having only three weeks `til Judgement Day. Bif's contacts in Cleveland had given him all sorts of technical material to go on, and he was sure that we could get most of the town to escape into Kentucky, which still had an intact government, if we had a well timed plan.\"\n\"And the timing couldn't have been better.\"\n\"The three week deadline actually placed us on the date right after Halloween which was going to have a new moon! Bif had said that this advantage was important, and started describing how we were going to wear camouflage under our Halloween outfits and use the annual party as a diversion. The outfits were also going to help us move people out of town through a relay system. That is, one youngster would come up to our door wearing an outfit and hand it off to someone in the basement, who would take his place and leave the house with candy. He would then give some candy to the guard watching the end of the street with his infrared camcorder. The kid would then duck around back and put on another costume, one matching the next trick or treater coming up to our house. In this way we could cycle more kids into our house where we would have a leaf fort coming out into the woods out back. A lot of details to work out at the time. The key part of the plan was to pretend that we were happy townsfolk who were ignorant of our fate and happy to spend one last Halloween with friends and family. We even invited the head of the new real estate holding company to the costume party! Bif had also developed something called an EMP bomb which was a stick of dynamite wired into a large coil so that when the bomb went off, a powerful radio wave would shoot out and fry out the computers and handi-talkies our guests were using. Bif and his assistants had maps that showed where everything was located, and which wires had to be snipped and which radios had to be fried in order to throw them off. We decided that the Bell Tower going off at Midnight would be the signal for our first attack, and I was placed in charge of tracking down the chief security for the bad guys and knocking them out after the electrical grid into town was severed. As you now know, when we actually did go through with our Plan, things really got out of hand.\"\nDisconnect Notice\nPossible Security Breach\nShutdown until further notice\nEric Miller is a graduate student at Michigan State University where he studies the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) in architectural and product design.

A bit further away, the plush earthtone carpeting slid beneath two easy chairs, a few feet apart, facing the fire at an angle that allowed easy conversation between them. Further away still, the fire echoed on the glass of a bay window, through which, were the shades of night not pulled, one might see down a narrow drive that extended three quarters of a mile to a dirt road which fled out of sight, passing no other habitation. On the fire's mantel sat a snifter of brandy, itself reflecting the glow of the flames multiple times.\nIts mate was held in the hands of an elderly gentleman sitting in one of the easy chairs. His eyes flickered with the flames; there was no guessing what color they might be in less fickle light. His face showed the beginnings of true age, the short, narrow beard had turned white, his hair was well on the way to silver itself. The arm that did not hold the brandy rested comfortably on the arm of the chair, his body was relaxed as he contemplated his companion.\nIn the other chair sat a man of indeterminate age, hands folded in his lap, posture slightly less comfortable than that of the older man. He was dressed in a robe of velvet and silk, the only thing about him which would distinguish him from any member of a crowd; if he took off the robe he might cease to exist.\nSilence existed for a second, an hour. It was ended when the man with the brandy spoke.\n\"I've seen you in this contemplative mood before, Andy. You're thinking of a story?\"\n\"Yes. Science fiction, I think.\"\nDavidson's eyes narrowed slightly. \"Not your usual genre. Doesn't sell well. Not that money's really a concern.\" He spread his hands, taking in the world in the flickering firelight, the mantel with its treasures hidden by the light, the rest of the mansion beyond shrouded in darkness. \"Tell me about it.\"\nAndrew paused, then gestured toward the window. \"Do you think that there's anyone out there? All those stars, probably all those planets. And all that time. Eternity for life to exist.\"\n\"I've never really thought about it. But a story must begin somewhere. So I'll give you all the kinds of life you want.\" He sipped his brandy.\n\"All those living beings over all that time. You see, it's the time that's important. Time enough for a vast array of creatures to have come into being. We cannot assume that they would be human, or even human-like. We cannot even assume that their thoughts are what a human can consider thinking.\"\n\"It's going to be a dull story, if we can't understand the characters thoughts. They claim that you can't tell a story about a nonhuman, that even if the characters are animals or aliens, they must have human, comprehensible motivations or the story will make no sense.\"\nAndrew nodded. \"Yes, we must bow that far from possible reality for the sake of a story. But I picked a bad example -- my aliens think enough like a human to make the comprehension simple. In fact, I'll bring up their psychology in some depth in a few minutes. For now, though, consider a physical rather than psychological difference, most notably, immortality.\"\n\"How immortal?\"\n\"Complete, total immunity to death. The body cannot be destroyed by any means, nor harmed, even by intention.\"\n\"Difficult to explain. Unless it's necesary to your story, I'd just give them very long lifespans.\"\n\"It's necessary. The explanation could be no more complex than a mental ability to control matter and energy. An inborn defense mechanism that can't be shut down.\"\n\"Still sounds pretty awkward.\"\n\"Indeed. But how much of reality is convenient? These same mental properties might be controllable to some extent. These aliens have both a limited shape changing ability and significant control over the world around them.\"\n\"Magic?\"\n\"Sorcery if you like, though a perfectly rational form of it. A reassembling of matter and energy to specific ends.\"\n\"And if you lived forever, you could get pretty good at it.\"\nAndrew nodded quickly. \"Very good. Perhaps even enough to create worlds, perhaps life itself.\"\n\"You've created God.\" Davidson took another small sip of his brandy, considering.\n\"Gods, perhaps. My story concerns a race of such beings. Millions of them.\"\n\"Be careful, Andy. You can't let your characters get out of control.\"\n\"That's exactly the story. These creatures, I call them Calagar, are out of control.\" He stood up, retrieved his snifter from the hearth. \"It's the long life, you see. How's this for a motivation: pure boredom.\"\n\"Certainly not out of the realm of possibility. Everything gets boring after a time. Even life itself, I suppose.\"\n\"Indeed. And in boredom begins cruelty. You can only drink of the milk of human kindness so long. Pain, suffering, these are the more interesting possibilities. You'd take it up as a hobby, stick with it because of the entertainment it offers; small, yes, but better than nothing.\"\n\"Very dark. Would not some morality, altruism exist, even in such beings? Or are they of one mind?\"\n\"Certainly it would exist, and any one Calagar might go through cycles, alternating good with evil as interest waned. But eventually, all of them would fall, every one. Eternity is a long time, and ideas and people change over even short time. And boredom does not; it is always the same.\"\n\"You usually write light, humorous or at least cheerful pieces. Why the change?\"\n\"Even I go through cycles, perhaps.\" Andrew grinned, produced a jug from the velvet darkness over the mantel. He refilled Davidson's glass, replaced the jug and seated himself again.\n\"Long cycles. You've been writing the same stuff for twenty six years, since I've known you, and probably before that as well. But continue; perhaps the variety will give some freshness to your writing. Not that it needs it.\"\n\"The Calagar attained the stars, easily. Where they went, they found new beings and places, brought technology, civilization, and, almost inevitably, destruction. If they could not find a convenient lifeform or world for a particular game, they created it, destroyed it and its population when it was no longer necessary, useful, or entertaining.\"\nDavidson looked contemplative again, offered nothing into the silence except a brief wave of the hands. Andrew continued.\n\"Of course, where there is one powerful, starfaring race, there would likely be another. And so there was, the Groli. Not immortal, not possessed of the mental sorceries of the Calagar, but highly advanced and technical. From the view port of their shorter lifetime, they might not lose the virtues that the Calagar had given up. And they would be aghast at the atrocities of the Calagar.\"\n\"A lot of good it would do them. Mortals against gods? How do you overcome something you cannot kill?\"\n\"The laws of this country do not permit you to kill a thief. How do you overcome him?\"\n\"You have him put in jail. But how do you jail a god?\"\n\"Remember their inability to harm themselves? Say the Groli managed to create a \"cage\" that reacted like a Calagar body, unaffected by their sorcery? A very large cage, planetary in scale, which could contain all of the Calagar, trap them forever where they could harm no one.\"\nDavidson shook his head sharply. \"War story, then? I doubt it would be very interesting. Battles get old quickly.\"\n\"Oh no! The war is only incidental to the story. The Groli win, although their own race is nearly destroyed as a result. The only interesting part about the war is the way one of the Calagar deals with it.\"\n\"Which is?\"\n\"Remember the boredom factor. Since an enemy is the first truly interesting thing to happen to the Calagar race since the beginning of time, they race off to battle. The thought that they could lose is unimportant. The odds of it are small, in any case. To the man, they attacked, and the Groli used this to their advantage, trapping each Calagar neatly in their cage.\"\n\"But?\" Davidson prompted.\n\"One, only one, of the Calagar considered the consequences of losing the battle that lay before them, truly considered the possibility that the Calagar _could_ lose. If he was bored now, spending eternity in a cage without even the outlet of sorcery to amuse himself would be even more boring. He fled, took cover with a group of lifeforms uninvolved in the war, changed his shape, avoided displays of sorcery, and waited.\"\n\"While all of his race were trapped.\"\n\"Yes, and for centuries more, waiting while the Groli race lost the knowledge of their technology, lost the skills to fight back, eventually lost even the ability to continue as a race. Waiting for the last possible enemy to die.\"\n\"Dull.\"\n\"Yes, but not so much as one would expect. In all of the universe, there was little chance of being detected, and cruelty exists on the small scale as well as the large. He could play with the world he had chosen, interact with it in a myriad of ways, bring it cruelty and kindness. But he could not destroy it, for to do so would be to lose his entertainment, and risk discovery in the search for more. Only when the last of the Groli had died did he destroy it and move on.\"\n\"To free the rest of his race?\"\n\"Perhaps, though I think first he would savor the experience of being a sole god in a universe unprepared to deal with such a being. I haven't really worked out that part of the story yet.\"\nDavidson considered for a time. \"It has potential. I should probably sleep on it for a while. It's hard to really find the motivation in such a character.\"\nAndrew smiled. \"Boredom, Davidson. Raw boredom.\" He stood up, retrieved a long jacket from somewhere outside the fire's glow. \"You've got a long drive home tonight.\"\n\"Indeed.\" Davidson stood up, put on the offered coat. Leaving the brandy glasses on the hearth, the two of them walked to the door, and through it into the deep August night.\n\"Good night,\" Davidson said, taking the two stairs down toward his car.\n\"Good bye,\" Andrew said, and there was a funny tone to his voice, as though muted by distance.\nDavidson turned. The house was almost a hundred yards away, though he had taken only a couple steps. His car was nowhere to be seen.\nIn the darkness of the forest, brilliant red eyes glowed, flickering like burgundy in the firelight. Three wolves emerged from the shadows, each as black as the night itself, seven feet tall at the shoulders, moving with a quicksilver speed toward him. Teeth shone coldly, though there was no moon.\n\"Just to make this interesting...\" Andrew commented, and a steel pistol appeared in Davidson's hand. \"There are exactly three bullets. Please don't make this boring, Davidson.\"\n\"By God, Andrew! We've known each other twenty six years!\"\nAndrew shook his head. \"No, only the blink of an eye.\"\nChristopher Kempke is a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University.

He sat down pulling out a stick of gum and relaxed. ``Time's like these are why I chose this life. No hassles, no troubles, nobody to bother me.''\n``Intruder has entered our area,'' the wall spoke.\n``No one except you, you crazy piece of machinery,'' Harris replied to the wall. ``Why can't you keep yourself off when I'm ... wait a second. What did you say?''\n``Intruder has entered our area,'' the wall repeated, not stifled in the least.\n``Identify.''\n``Computing. Identified as the Seaward, Winward in command. Isn't that the person you had a slight confrontation with-''\n``Yes, Nimrod, it is. Now shut up.'' Harris jumped into the pilot's couch and set for full burn in five seconds. He strapped himself down as the ACCESS came on line. ``Four, three, two... ''\nA blast shook the ship. It lurched causing Harris to temporarily loose track of which way was up. It lay sideways in relation to what should have been, as the gravity disengaged. Harris floated against the straps holding him down. He touched a panel and a streak of fire lept out striking a vessel at close range. He tapped again- silence. He brought up the view to see what was left. Two cruisers still advanced. His attention was drawn to a console which was blinking slightly. Estimated Time of Repair: 3 minutes. They had even taken out Nimrod. Luckily he was able to repair himself, and then the ship, but that would take time.\nTime was one luxury Harris McQuaide could no longer afford.\nThe edge of the world was outlined sharply against the world below. The land curved into infinity at an infinite distance. His eye was caught by the view as he felt his mind slipping into nothingness...\n``Quite a view isn't it?'', a voice brought him back from the edge of chaos. He spun around to see a rather old looking human dressed in white robes befitting his station. He rose quickly only to be motioned to return to his seat. ``No respect necessary, my friend. You are here because I asked you, although I wish you weren't.'' The man moved around to a chair opposite him.\n``What? Why was I asked here then if you do not wish me here?'' Malcorn asked, his voice rising slightly in anger.\nThe man motioned slightly. ``It is not that I do not like your presence, it is a matter of why you are here. I wish I did not have to send someone of your importance.''\nMalcorn skipped the obvious question of where he was supposed to be going and asked another. ``Why? Is there some danger?''\nThe man nodded. ``Much danger in fact, but I am afraid you are the only one who can go, and therefore you are to be sent.''\n``What am I to do, then?'' Malcorn inquired.\n``You must journey to Shell, and find out something we have wondered since our birth here.''\nMalcorn turned noticeably pale. He tried to speak, failed, and tried again. ``Shell. No one has been there in over a Millenia. Why should we send someone there now?''\n``Because it is necessary. But first you should meet your companion in this journey.''\nMalcorn barely noticed this statement as the man reached over to a console and pressed a switch. A man walked in dressed in the black robes, signifying his occupation.\n``Seeker'', Malcorn barely whispered. The shocks of this were coming too fast for any reason.\nThe man sat down. ``I am Taaylor . I am pleased to meet you,'' he said, but did not say. The words came into Malcorn 's mind. ``A pleasure indeed.'' His mind touched Malcorn's as he looked over him mentally.\nThe older man sat down as well. ``Gentlemen, you leave at Day.''\nDarsayae stepped into a dimly lit corridor. It was times like these that she hated her profession. Stepping into this world was like stepping into her own personal hell. The world of technology always held horrors for her, but the man she chased had to be brought to justice. Why he ran to this place she would never know. She spun around as a voice echoed from behind her.\n``Go home, witch. You will never find me and even if you do you will not take me alive'', the voice laughed. ``Why don't you leave? I can tell how badly you wish to.''\n``I cannot. You know of your crimes yet you mocked them? ``, she answered the voice. ``How can you live with yourself?''\n``How can you live with yourself, witch, hunting down a man who seeks only to survive?'' the voice answered back.\n``Survive at the expense of the others?''\n``If that is necessary.''\nShe crept around the corner, swinging to the side of the wall, following the voice. ``Is it not bad enough that you have trespassed upon the ground of our forefathers. None have been here for years and now you disturb their peace.''\n``You are wrong, of course. I have been here many times and have yet to find anything resembling spooks. I also have reason to doubt that there has been no one here in a long time. As a matter of fact, there are two here now, headed in your direction at this time... '' The voice died off as it faded in distance.\nMalcorn and Taaylor walked the corridors. Taaylor rose his head slightly. Malcorn studied him curiously but continued walking. Looking towards the edge of the corridor\n``What is it?''\n``We are not alone'', came the thought back. ``And it is not necessary to speak.''\n``If it's all the same to you, I'll keep talking'', he said in a horse whisper.\nTaaylor nodded as he moved forward. There was no sense in angering his guide. Without this man, or someone else he would be blind as well as deaf.\nThey entered a room large enough to house several of the Haltar's race vehicles. A large console adorned the south wall with a large piece of glass resembling a screen. Malcorn walked over and checked over the equipment. It appeared to be fully operational. He flipped several switches as the board came to life. The keyboard was more advanced than the one he learned on, this one being a touch sensor, but the layout was the same. He hummed to himself as he worked.\n``Duck!'' came the mental scream from Taaylor . The scream froze Malcorn in is tracks as he was hit from behind. He spun around and leapt into the air, his wings spreading from behind his back. A figure stepped out into the light. A light glimmered off of her metallic looking suit as she rose her hands. A mist flowed forth to envelope the creature which had struck him.\n``Stop, he hit the... '' His scream came too late. Malcorn watched helplessly as the creature bounced off of the console and fell to the ground. He realized that the screen was actually a window as lights came on behind it. A large bay opened beyond to reveal the lights of centuries past, clicking on as they had centuries ago.\nAnd a door, not opened in two and a half millenia creaked open to the vacuum of space.\nHarris looked at the control console of his ship and saw the lights blinking all over the system. ``Nimrod Status.''\nThe computer squeaked, corrected, and tried again. ``Ship's or Tactical?''\n``Both.''\n``Ship's status: All systems malfunctioning. ACCESS travel has malfunctioned. Effective Time of Repair:12 minutes. Life support: functioning. Shields: inactive. Irreparable. Communications functional: not at optimum level. Tactical: Two FORWARD cruisers are still in pursuit. Suggestion: Get out of here immediately.''\n``Very funny.'' Harris McQuaide looked at the screen and confirmed Nimrod's messages. He touched several consoles and brought them to life. ``Harris McQuaide, in command of the Infinite Possibilities. Come on Winward, give a guy a break!''\nThe comm panel chortled, but whether from Winward or static was impossible to tell. ``Your drive is shot, McQuaide. You can't escape. One more hit and you're gone. Give it up.''\n``I wouldn't give you the pleasure'', Harris McQuaide shot back. He glanced at the panel. ETR: 9 minutes. Keep stalling. ``What guarantee would I have that you'd let me live. Regulations or no you'd love to get rid of me for the episode outside of Bantor IV. I remember the headlines on the news: `Winward, fleet commander of FORWARD, was defeated by Harris McQuaide, a loner originating from Earth. Their race in the single person ships between Bantor VII and IV ended in a firey explosion which destroyed Winward's ship. The commander ejected and was later picked up by the victor, Harris, and hauled back to the finish line on the outside of his vessel.' '' Harris smiled as the memory came back to him.\n``Shut up,'' Winward spoke back. ``You cheated, and don't say you didn't.''\n``Oh yeah, I cheated, Just enough to counter your cheat of putting unstable fuel in the opponents vehicles. I just used it to my advantage.'' Harris sat back to glance at the clock. ETR: 7 minutes. ``You still haven't answered my question: What guarantee?''\n``You have my word.'' Winward replied.\n``Which is about as good as a swim suit on Pluto,'' Harris said under his breath. ``Let's put it this way, Winward, I think I'd have a better chance trying to outrun you, and don't think I can't.''\n``I don't think, I know. You are a dead ship, but I'll give you five minutes to choose Harris. Five minutes.'' The comm went dead. ETR 6 minutes.\n``I've cut it close before. At least he doesn't know about you my friend.'' He glanced at the system adorning his wall.\nThe wall replied. ``Estimate 3% chance of survival in this affair if you insist on staying here. Nice knowing you Harris.''\n``Sarcastic Machine.''\nHe activated the comm panel again. ``Harris to Seaward. Prepare to receive my vessel. You win Winward.''\n``Preparing to receive.''\nNimrod rattled off. ``ETA at enemy vessel 3 minutes. ETR 3.5 minutes. This might work after all.''\n``Thank you.''\n``You're welcome.''\nThe ship moved into position for docking. Harris touched several panels and powered up his engines. He watched the repair status light. The amber light appeared to laugh at him. He counted to himself.\n``Laugh at this Winward.'' The light went green, and he punched the panel. The ship shot off in an arc away from the vessel and rotated, fired, rotated again, and was gone.\nTen seconds later he re-emerged into Einstein space. ``Nimrod, time until they track us?''\n``Impossible to tell, unknown status of their drive systems at time of ACCESS. ACCESS is down again.''\nHarris McQuaide got up to walk to the rear of the vessel. He pulled off an access hatch, and began working on several controls, murmuring to himself about crazy machines.\nThe ship lurched and came to a sudden stop. ``Warning: collision imminent with structure.''\n``A little late aren't you?''\n``Maybe.''\nHarris McQuaide suppressed a comment he wanted to make. He recalled the last time he directed an insult at it, something to the point of ``Drop dead''. It tried to interpret it as an order and nearly got them both killed. He walked up to the control room and stared outside the bridge window. ``There's nothing out here'', Harris McQuaide mused quietly.\n``That nothing is off our mass scale'', Nimrod replied casually.\nHarris McQuaide opened his mouth but nothing came out. He closed it again as he looked at the view screen. He touched several panels and brought up a view of it. The digital readout showed a sphere shaped object.\n``Width?'' Harris asked quietly.\n``One AU in radius, 186 million miles in diameter.'' Nimrod replied.\nHarris McQuaide touched several panels and swung around the ship. He could not see any stars in the area, absolutely nothing. He brought the ship around again and starting flying above this structured he had collided with.\nA square of the darkness opened. Light beamed through the opening.\n``Who do you think you are being here?'' Malcorn said from ten feet above the floor. His question was addressed at the woman who now stood over her prey. She turned around to face him.\n``What do you think I'm doing here?'' she shot back.\n``Her name is Darsayae , sorceress of the Align. She was chasing this being known as Cy and apparently has apprehended him, ``Taaylor replied. She looked at him and then recognized him for what he was.\n``A Tech and a Seeker. An interesting combination, and almost impossible. They are not of close company.''\n``We are here to seek answers to questions given to us by the Council. However, we are not able to give these answers to you.''\n``I don't really care. I have what I came for. What do you plan on doing about that hole out there?''\nMalcorn had to admit he had not even thought about it. He berated himself as he landed. Such a hole could have destroyed the world if the ancient technology had not prevented it in some way. He landed and walked across to the console. Amazing the old technology. In fact if he didn't know any better he would say something was approaching the hole. Of course he couldn't be right about...\nA shadow eclipsed the stars beyond. A large black object glided smoothly into the gap. The scars on it's hull indicated it had been in a battle of some sort. Several relays clicked over as the vessel cleared the door and it slid shut automatically. It floated gently into a small bay as a docking arm extended.\n``I believe this answers all our questions,'' Taaylor thought, but the rest of the group heard.\nHarris looked across the small bay his ship landed in. ``Nimrod, where are we?'', he asked of the blank control panel.\n``We are aboard the Infinite Possibilities in a bay of unknown origin. There appears to be some source of power in the area, accounting for the lights. ``\n``Thanks a lot. I could have figured that out myself.''\n``Will you allow me to continue?''\n``Sorry'', Harris threw to him sarcastically.\n``Apology accepted. There are four life forms at 23 degrees, behind that large shield of translucent titanium, a substance designed during...\n``All right I get the picture'', Harris cut him off impatiently. He strolled over to his locker and swung the door outward, and removed his wrist rifle. Strapping it on his wrist he started walking to the door. ``Nimrod, I-''\n``Air sample breathable, gravity slightly stronger than that of earth. No noxious substances or compounds which would endanger your life form,'' the wall rattled off. ``Would you like me to accompany you?''\nHarris sighed. ``I guess it couldn't hurt.''\nHarris walked towards the door and flipped a switch for the airlock to open. The door opened to receive a breath of slightly stale air. He stepped out, slipping to one side as he waited. A door within the airlock opened.\nA two foot orb floated out of the door, hovering about three feet above the ground. It slipped aside of Harris and began moving forward. Harris looked skyward (wherever that happen to be here) and fell in behind the orb.\nMalcorn and Taaylor sat in anticipation as Darsayae stared at the object within the lock. Malcorn noticed the pale look which had crossed her face. Amazing that such a person could look so pale.\nSuddenly she stood up and walked towards the doorway. Upon reaching the hall, she turned right, heading for the hatch of the long arm. Malcorn and Taaylor were too stunned to say anything so they just waited.\nHarris looked out at the stark hallway. The shallow light from the nearby panels gave little or no light for one to see by. Nimrod lit up the front of his globe, a small spotlight. It scanned across the panels in the hall and stopped on a young woman in the center of the hall. Harris sucked in his breath. The woman outstretched her hands towards Harris . She made a motion and Harris felt his body grow heavy. His knees buckled as the ground came up to give him its greeting.\nDarsayae looked at the spherical object next to the limp body of the strange man. It seemed to look directly back at her. ``What are you?''\n``I am Nimrod,'' The sphere said in a normal tone. ``Function: Control of drive and control systems of the Infinite Possibilities. Basis of function: Octal Pattern Recognition memory core.''\nDarsayae stared at it, blinking as if it would go away. It remained there as Taaylor and Malcorn stepped into the corridor silently, the old man leaning on the younger. Malcorn looked at Darsayae. ``What did you do to him?''\n``She placed him in a form of suspended animation similar to sleep, however slightly deeper, his respiration has been slowed to 8 breaths per minute which...``\n``I didn't ask you,'' Malcorn shot back, then stopped, realizing he was talking to a machine. ``Do you always answered what you haven't been asked?''\n``It's a habit of his, I'm afraid,'' the man on the ground said as he rolled over. ``Lady, what the blazes did you throw at me? The last time I felt like this was when I had a bit too much Vodka back on the good old Mud-ball. Fun at the time, but not much fun afterwards.'' She raised her hands again to which he raised his arm, showing the rifle. ``Uh, uh. Lady, I wouldn't do that if I were you. This thing may not be as pretty in optical effects, but it's as effective.'' He rolled over and got to his feet. She moved again to which he moved in response.\nSide stepping, he grabbed her arm and threw her slightly sideways into the doorway. She grabbed the jam and swung around landing on her feet. She spun around to see the device on Harris's arm glow and she slumped to the ground. Harris turned around to eye the other two. ``I have no objections to talking to friends, but answering orders is not in my rule book, Got it?''\nThey both nodded slightly, when Malcorn suddenly looked up. ``How do you speak our language so well?''\n``Language, what are you talking about?'' It then occurred to him, although he never met this race before, the language was as if he knew it, because he did.\nIt was his own.\n`` `In the years of the great, we wished to know what we were set to do, what life would we lead in this world, and so we set out, and found this, this that we call our home. And that which we shall and can never leave.' '' Taaylor recited from his ancient religion text. They had moved into the control room and brought Darsayae with them. She was still out cold from the blast. Cy had been tied up, but was sitting in a chair just slightly out of reach. Harris had a cup of coffee next to him, sitting atop Nimrod's slightly curved head. He made a splendid coffee table. Taaylor and Malcorn were slightly opposite, enjoying the fresh food from McQuaide's ship. Harris sipped his coffee.\n``So what's it mean?'' Harris asked?\nTaaylor shrugged. ``It is believed that we did not come from this world, but were brought here from somewhere else. We discovered this world and completed it, using the technology of whoever started it. We then sealed ourselves within this world so as not to have their problems or intervention. We began to wonder whether or not there was anybody still out there so we came here. You appear to have answered our questions. ``\n``What about the people who were here before you?'' Harris asked after taking another drink.\n``They were powerful but small in numbers. Our people defeated them after discovering this place.'' Taaylor scanned the mind of Harris to see how much he was believing. He could tell Harris was taking most of it in.\n``Do you know where your people came from, how long they've been here?'' Harris asked his curiosity aroused.\n``This was approximately 2000 revolution of Mitar ago.'' Taaylor sense the next question forming in Harris's mind. ``Mitar is a silver point at the equator of the sphere. We measure our year by it.''\n``Nimrod, compute time necessary for it to revolve a complete circuit and compare to earth year.''\n``One circuit of the sphere would be 1.36 Earth Standard years. Total equals approximately 2270 earth years ago.''\nHarris leaned back in his chair and sighed. ``Compare to Earth history. Any similar events?''\nNimrod sat for a moment. ``3007.23 Earth years ago a colonization fleet was headed for Sidra Major 78 light years from Earth. They were lost approximately 29 light years from Earth.''\nHarris looked puzzled. ``Any other data?''\n``Classified.''\n``Classified? In other words you don't have it because it wasn't given to you because of its status.''\n``Yes.''\n``During that time, ACCESS, Faster than light travel, didn't exist. They would have been using ramscoop generators.''\n``Yes. Relative travel was the mode of the period.''\nHarris sat back, leaving all this settle in. ``That means that these people are descendants of the people of that mission.''\n``87.94% probability.''\n``And if that's true, FORWARD would try to take control of it if they found out about it, these people being an old colony of earth. they're almost a galactic empire now, with several races under control. With the technology they would possess from this structure... ''\n``They could not be opposed,'' Nimrod finished. ``That is against my design to allow that to happen.''\n``We have to get out of here.'' He paused to figure out what to do next.\n``It looks like I have a problem, gents. My ship needs some work bad, and I can't make it anywhere else. This place maybe just the place for me to stick around, at least until I get this thing fixed and rested.'' Harris sat back with his coffee as Nimrod went over to examine Darsayae . After a quick scan he lowered himself down and sat practically on top of her.\n``Get up, miss. This is no time to be sleeping, or rather pretending to be asleep.'' He floated back up and drifted over towards Harris. She sat up suddenly and raised her hands to bring them together. The energy which shot forth glanced off of Nimrod and struck a nearby wall, burning the metal. The orb turned around. ``My dear, doing that may endanger yourself. I would restrain from it in the future.'' He then floated over to become a coffee table again. Darsayae looked at Harris, expecting to see him smiling at her failure. Instead she saw him regarding her intently. It was not mockery but instead, it seemed, in respect.\nShe twisted to her feet and walked over towards the group. It seemed to her that they had done well in her absence. She sat down and picked up one of the cookies which were in front of her. After a bite she said, ``You want to stay here, that's fine. When can we leave?''\n``Leave?'' Harris retorted. ``I didn't know you were staying! You may leave now if you wish or a week from now, which is when I expect everything to be done. Either way it doesn't matter to me.''\n``Then we're not prisoners?'' Darsaye asked.\nMalcorn looked at her. ``No, Harris has been informing us of the world he came from and we have been comparing it to ours. They are a strange people, but we are the same in many ways.''\nDarsayae looked at Harris and saw him finish his cup of coffee as he got up. He then turned down a side corridor towards the way she had come in. She got up to follow. Malcorn tried to get up as well but Taalor held his arm, shaking his head. Malcorn sighed and sat down. Women. One of these days he might understand them... might.\nDarsayae caught up to Harris before he reached the entrance and fell into step behind him. When he came to the entrance he looked at it, puzzled, then turned to her and motioned. Without a word she stepped forward and opened the door. The light from a sun beyond beamed inward as Harris had his breath catch in his throat.\nBeyond there was nothing, a vast expanse of space between him and anything. Several objects floated nearby as the ground he stood on rotated. The motion was slight but still felt to such an old space hand. He shook his head and brought his sight to one of the nearby objects. Several thousand strips rotated in the nothing, turning slowly back in upon itself. The ground he stood on was at a ninety degree angle to the rest of the ground. One strip floated close by. He studied that, trying to steady his dead nerves. It seemed to him he was standing on a wall of a pit dug into the ground. The land curved upwards until it was lost in the sun beyond.\nHarris leaned back against the wall taking a deep breath. Nimrod floated into the area and looked outward. ``Nimrod, analysis.''\n``Analyzing. It appears the sun of this system is encased in a sphere. Colloquial reference: Dyson Sphere. A design created by Freeman Dyson during the late 1960's of earth. Built to collect the total solar output of the sun and convert it into energy for use. The strips in the area appear to be coated with vegetation and soil.''\nDarsayae nodded. ``Our homes. The strip itself is bent upon itself making it one sided.''\n``A Moebius strip,'' Nimrod continued. ``The strip's bend would occlude sunlight, giving a day-night cycle.''\nHarris motioned her to close the door. She did so and then turned to look at him. He drew a breath and then headed back to the bay of the Infinite. Darsayae and Nimrod followed slowly behind, one wondering what had overcome Harris, the other what technology it took to build such a structure.\n``Damn. Where is he?'' Winward asked of a man scanning a nearby panel. ``He couldn't have gotten too far.''\n``We have his course and time, we can be there in several minutes, assuming he hasn't improved his drive since the last time we met, `` the man stated clearly.\nWinward turned around and shouted some orders. He then turned back to the panel. ``This time he's not getting away.''\nThe fleet lept into space, the derelict left behind to fend for itself.\n``Nimrod, initiate all repair systems. I want to get out of here,'' Harris said to the globe. The globe moved to comply with his commands, resuming it's normal position in the airlock. Darsayae moved in behind him as he sat down on the bridge.\n``What came over you back there?'' she asked carefully.\nHarris looked at her as if he had forgotten she was there. He smiled. ``So much for your fear of technology, huh?'' She seemed startled that he knew, but he continued. ``Guess it was fear, fear that something like this could exist.'' His voice trailed off at the end as his mind remembered the sight his eyes had seen but his mind had refused to believe.\n``So something can get at you,'' Darsayae stated. ``Makes me think you're more normal than you appear to be.''\nHe smiled again. ``Me? I'm as normal as the next guy, just a little crazier. After all, I spend all my life in space. It is my home.''\n``You must have seen a lot.''\n``A lot that I would have missed, and would have been more the sorry for if I hadn't seen,'' he said nodding. ``But I do have to get out of here I'm afraid.''\nHer expression changed to worry. ``Why? Couldn't you just stay here?''\nHe shook his head. ``Afraid not, not with Winward on my tail. Where do you think I got the scars on this ship from?''\n``What did you do that he's after you?''\n``Well, it's kind of a long story. What it basically comes down to is we were on opposite sides and his side lost. He's one to hold a grudge.''\nShe looked at him awhile and was startled to here a beep on the comm panel. ``Status: Systems are coming on line. Main Drive repaired. ACCESS repaired. Life support fully functional. Ships have entered system.''\nThis time Harris didn't ignore him. ``Model and identification.''\n``Seaward and escort ship. Time to this point: 15 minutes.''\nHarris grew worried, Darsayae could tell that much. ``Stupid power hungry fool,'' he spat. ``Winward won't you ever give up?''\nDarsayae looked at him intently. ``What do you plan to do?''\n``Get out of here, ASAP.''\nShe did not recognize the abbreviation, but understood the intent. She got up to leave and was astonished to see Harris following her. ``Maintain repair status. I'll be back. Be ready to leave.''\n``I'll be here,'' the panel answered.\nHarris followed Darsayae back to the control room, where he said his good-byes. Cy still looked miffed at being captured but maintained his position. Darsayae then followed him to the airlock, as did Taalor and Malcorn.\n``Wait a couple of minutes and then open the doors. I'll be out of here so fast it'll be funny.'' He turned to Darsayae. ``Guess this is good-bye, huh?''\nDarsayae reached up and kissed him, not gently as he tried to enter the airlock. He turned back to the group thinking the same thing Malcorn was: Women!\nHe entered the ship as the door slid shut.\n``Nimrod, bring all systems up.'' The bay door slid open again, taking the Infinite out with it as the air which had been pumped in escaped. He activated the drive and headed away as it closed.\n``There he is, sir,'' the man at the console spoke. ``He just left a large spherical object in the middle of this system.''\nWinward missed this comment as he saw Harris in his sights. ``Fire when ready, gunner.''\nHarris checked the tactical console and smiled as he brought his hand down upon the ACCESS switch. A sound stopped him. He spun around to see Darsayae standing behind him. ``What are you doing here?''\n``To see the things you have seen,'' she stated simply.\nA blast shook the ship, then another. He spun around to see the Seaward pulling directly in front of him. He touched a panel causing the ship to head back towards the sphere.\n``What are you doing?'' Darsayae asked.\n``Taking you back!''\n``Not on your life.''\nHarris paused. If he went back, Winward would find out about the sphere and its technology. That would definitely be a problem. But to keep Darsayae aboard ship? Damn. His hand touched the ACCESS panel and the ship vanished, Harris hoping history wouldn't repeat itself.\nWinward turned to the console. ``Gone, sir. We weren't ready to track him.''\nWinward looked like he would explode but calmed down as his eyes settled on the tactical. That sphere still was on the scanner.\n``Let's see what we have here.'' Winward smiled as thoughts of conquest crossed his mind.\nJoe Walters is currently a Senior\/Sophomore in Penn State's 2\/4 year Computer Science program.

The sulfur in the air was thick enough to cause shortness of breath. It was not a good week. Blaze shuffled down the snow laden walkway with a weariness that seemed to be the mood of the times. Entering through the glassy front doors to Hitachi, Ltd., he smiled with a kind of childish glee. Unlike most people, Blaze was in love with his work. It was the only reason that he was able to get up in the morning and face the pain of the real world. He was in charge of data security research and development at Hitachi, Ltd. His research team was responsible for the design of most of the systems that guarded computers all over the world. He was an ICE designer, Intrusion Counter measure Electronics. It was perhaps one of the dirtiest jobs around. In order to protect a system you had to be able to understand the slime trying to get in. Blaze was a console jockey, but also a talented and dedicated research software engineer. He walked a line few people could understand -- between the slimy underworld and the corporate zaibatsu.\nOf late, a lot of small-time jockeys had been making runs at data banks that should have been impenetrable. And they had been succeeding. They were using some new form of worm. The worm was capable of changing some of the basic rules of the matrix and by doing so confuse any protection system running in that space. It was like fixing the space so that zero equals one, anything that relied on that type of basic logic was toast. Right now his team was working on taking out parts of code from the ICE that relied on matrix operations to try and get around this matrix worm.\nEvery morning his team assembled in the conference room to discuss what was being done. The smoke filled room reeked of sweat that had been sitting around for days on end. You could taste the caffeine reek in the air. Most of the people in the room hadn't slept in days, and they couldn't count on when they would be allowed to sleep again. Even Blaze hadn't slept, he had been in Osaka trying to find the source of the new worm that was giving him only headaches.\n\"Ok, I know you're all tired. I want a short report from each of you, then we go home. Can't expect you to work forever.\", Blaze said as calmly as his overworked nerves could manage.\n\"Well, it's a nightmare. There's no way we can remove all the matrix dependencies from any of the Orange or Mandarin defense systems. They have had matrix dependencies reduced, but it's not possible to make them effective and not have them depend on the matrix.\", John Yater said from his tilted back chair, eyes half-asleep.\n\"Yes, I have to agree. It's just not possible. O'Yatish has been working on a new minimal ICE that doesn't need any matrix but he doesn't believe it will hold up to any kind of attack that is worth shit.\", Lacy said with an eager excitement. They kind of seemed to say, \"Let us go. We can't fix it.\"\n\"Ok, that's what I felt was inevitable. Right now security is working with the governments of several nations to try and erase all copies of the worm and eliminate whoever or whatever wrote it. But the leads are slim. Word on the street is that some AI wrote the damn thing and started spreading it around. I am almost willing to buy this, except for the fact that we are the only people with AI's that know about that type of stuff. I hope to God that someone working for us here didn't dream up this thing. I don't think that's likely though. I want you all to go home and get some rest. Come back tomorrow and we will see what we can do.\"\nThis wasn't good, Blaze thought. It could only mean big trouble. If an AI did this on its own, it would be in violation of the AI act of 2003. Then on the other hand if an AI didn't do it, someone inside of Hitachi must have had a hand in it. Word on the street was that someone was going to take a run at Hitachi, Ltd. and with this new worm that might even be possible. Blaze spent the rest of the day working the outer matrix defenses and putting everyone on alert. If it was going to happen it would happen soon.\nBack home in the gloomy corporate owned apartment. Half-a-bottle of rum later. \"Should stay sharp tonight,\" Blaze whispered into the air, \"But I'm in the mood to get a little wired.\" Blaze popped a sleeping pill before laying down in a fitful doze. About a quarter after three, the console woke him. A level one security breach was in progress. Blaze's dizzy head groggily slapped the electrodes to his body and punched into the matrix. The familiar bright lights of Hitachi, Ltd. surrounding him like an old friend. The never ending red matrix lines, criss-crossing into infinite space. This was home. A kind of adrenaline that you couldn't get with drugs. A fire that singed the soul, ground the will, and blurred the mind. A lifeless form in a sea of egoless dark.\nHe punched the throttle and zipped within four grids of the break-in. It was a melee of ICE and fire. The worm was re-weaving the space while the ICE was doing its best to attack it. In a rhythmless dance, round and round they went. Behind the worm the data jockey was riding through it all. It would not be long before the worm had cut a hole in the most defensive ICE on Earth. It was almost beautiful, but Blaze wasn't there to admire the art, only to stop it. First he flooded the zone with a new anti-worm that he had dreamed up. To the worm it looked like an infected matrix area, causing the real worm to not work its way into that area. The only difference was that this worm didn't do anything but look like trouble. After doing this, Blaze punched behind the console jockey that was ridding the worm. He hadn't noticed Blaze due to a new cybercloak the guys down in research had come up with. From behind, he flooded the space around the pirate with a nice and neat killer virus. The virus was called Kafka-4. Anything it touched was put on trial and then executed --- no pardons, no appeals. It didn't even give him time to defend himself. He was put out like a dying ember, you could almost hear the scream on the other end when his brain fried.\n\"Loser,\" Blaze laughed into the glowing matrix.\nNow, it was time to flush the worm. Blaze locked off the space segment and then disconnected it from the matrix. Then he refilled the space with a nice, neat, clean new matrix. Of course this could only be done in places that didn't have anything in it, but it was very effective. Then he reactivated the security ICE for that sector.\nBefore he punched out he decided to take a spin around this area of the matrix just to be safe, after all he would not be able to sleep after this anyway. He noticed something funny over a few grids; some shiny deep dark ICE surrounding a data core. It shouldn't have been there. None of his people had put it there, it must be something one of the other groups had built. Blaze zipped over it real slow, trying to scan it. It was some of the densest ICE he had ever seen. He instructed the AI that ran his home deck to try and break off a sample and analyze it. The deck's data construct peeled off and tried to attack a corner of the black wall, but it completely vanished while Blaze was watching it. This was something serious, it was not only defensive but offense as well.\n\"Shit. This deck isn't going to cut that. I'm going to have to go into the lab and try to it there,\" Blaze swore. It was his only chance against ICE like that. In the lab the console had the use of a couple of custom ICE breaking AI's that could attack the ICE at so many different places at once that what ever controlled the ICE would get overloaded and break down. The deck in his apartment, while one of the finest decks money could buy, was nothing compared to the wrath that the Cryle AI could bring down on a wall of ICE.\nThe wind whipped across his face as he left his car for the front door. The moon rose above the company in an ominous glow of dark power. Coming into the main lab, Blaze switched on Cryle. Cryle was a special version of the NuralBio AI. It was equipped with a very large database of knowledge about dealing with the net and how data was transferred around. When used properly it was the most effective form of ICE-breaking tool ever created.\n\"Ok, Cryle. Here's the deal. There is some type of ICE taking up most of quadrant F67M. I didn't put it there. No one on my team put it there. I want to know what it is hiding and why. I tried to do a scan with an extra deck image but it was wiped before it even got close. What ever it is, it is very dense and very offensive. The probe didn't even get close enough to start scanning before it was purged. Do a scan on that sector and tell me what you think. I also want a complete summary of all data that has moved into or out of that sector in the past month.\"\nBlaze could taste this hack in the back of his throat. It had been a long time since something had come along that could give him a real challenge. Most of the systems left in the world Blaze had designed or helped with. This was different. The fear and excitement of a virgin jockey was coursing through his veins.\n\"Blaze, I am not sure what that thing is, but it sure is weird. There has been no traffic into or out, of that sector ever. I went all the way back to the date that sector was created. Something had to put that ICE there, but it did it some way that doesn't generate data traffic. In any case that is the meanest ICE I have ever seen. You can't even get close enough to find out what it is. It is so dense that I am not sure that it was built to be broken. It looks more like a one way door. What ever was put there ain't coming out and it sure is not going to be friendly when you try coming in. Take my advice, leave it alone.\" Cryle's voice coming out of the walls shook Blaze out of a trauma glaze.\n\"Sorry, I can't just let it go. Here is what I want to try. I want you to run at it with the new Russian breaker you've been playing with, while I attack it head on with a matrix bomb. I know it will be impossible to control the deck after the bomb goes off, but, with any luck, we can send in a dumb probe after we punch a hole in it. In this case we are not doing a secret run. If I have to level that entire sector, that ICE is coming down.\"\n\"Ok. All systems are go. I am sending in the Russian breaker. It will attack the {0,0,0} end of the ICE in one minute, 25 seconds. Be ready to hit the {1,0,0} end with the matrix bomb when the clock on your deck reaches zero. It will count the seconds down. Because you will be in the matrix at the time the bomb goes off I want you to control the release not some subprocess I spawn off; it is safer. All right?\", Cryle's metallic tone echoed.\n\"Let's do it,\" he screamed. Blaze's voice was barely audible above the massive AI's humming. He jacked into the matrix about a click away from the center of the ICE and began to run forward filling the space in between with a variety of fast processes that would keep the matrix busy and not allow the ICE any room in which to attack his deck. The clock was counting down. Let than thirty seconds. Twenty. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Release. Blaze released the matrix bomb and filled the entire sector with a mass of random logic.\nHe was put out like a dying ember, you could almost hear the scream on the other end when his brain fried.\n\"Loser,\" some AI laughed from the glowing matrix.\nMatthew Sorrels considers himself a modern Existentialist.

I didn't want this to be my whole makeup though, so I countered it with jeans. A featureless white shirt and grey tie completed the outfit, and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses completed the image. Looking at myself, I allowed a small smile. Perfect. I left the room by a door which wasn't a door, and stood on a busy city street corner. Dozens of people were around, but none of them noticed my strange and sudden appearance, because I didn't want them to.\nI looked down the street and up to where the Channel 8 building stood, a secure, modest 14-story office building, and smiled again. It was 6:00 in the evening, and the sun would be gone in a few minutes. Everything was perfect for what I had to do. There was nothing left now but to wait and look around this world into which I had so recently returned. I spent some time in careful examination of my surroundings.\nA few minutes later almost no one else was on the street, and those that were moved quickly and precisely, since each of them had a meeting he or she could not miss.\nIt was exactly 6:15 when I reached Channel 8, and found the lobby empty. I walked slowly toward the elevator, to give everyone a few more moments to get home. Time was something I had more of than others. Once I started the ball rolling, it would go quickly enough. Even more quickly than the last time: three days. It hardly seemed enough, but there was another more knowledgeable than I calling my shots, and I could not question that intelligence.\nThe elevator opened immediately when I pushed the button, probably by chance, although little enough was in this venture. I entered, and rose to the studio level. A man met me as I stepped out, and asked if I wanted to have the curtains open. He seemed to accept my presence quietly, though he had never met me before. \"No,\" I responded. There was nothing to see; I had gained faith, if nothing else, in two millenia. Mankind, perhaps, didn't have even that.\n6:20. I walked to the studio, to the anchorman reading the six o'clock news. As I approached, he stopped reading in the middle of a sentence and offered me his seat. This was too easy. I wished briefly that it could remain this way. However, men needed free will for both good and evil. Only through free will could I be once again betrayed; that betrayal was the primary reason I was here. The secondary one was the reason I had to speak to the world.\nI took the seat at 6:25, and gave the other stations enough time to loop the broadcast to their own viewers before I spoke. My language was a strangely enhanced speech that spoke directly to my listener's minds, saving me the effort of speaking in several languages. The recordings of these words would probably thoroughly befuddle later analysts.\nAfter waiting for almost two thousand years for this moment, the speech was easy. I raised my arms and brought them down heavily on the table. The tension pulled tight all over the world. My protection was wearing thin, and would vanish altogether when I finished speaking. Thinking this, I spoke.\n\"People of the world, with this gesture I take the stars from your night sky. Those which you have looked up upon for your lives are gone.\"\nWithout looking out the window, I knew it was true.\n\"There is only blackness there, and this is the way it shall remain until you can convince me to put the stars back. The first rule of my game is simple---there are five words which you must speak to me. It doesn't matter who speaks them, so long as it is in my presence, but don't bother to come read me a dictionary, for the other rule is this: To speak a word, you must know why it is one of the five. For each of the words you speak correctly, I shall put back a fifth of the stars in the sky. Nothing else save my death can cause them to reappear, and that death can come only at the hands of one who holds my trust.\"\nThe obligation upon the minds of the world began to unravel.\n\"I will remain here, alone except for those I take to teach. Come to me with your answers.\"\nI stopped speaking, and the compulsion snapped. Those people around me looked dazed for a moment. I took the opportunity.\n\"Leave this place at once.\"\nThey knew my power---none of them questioned me. The broadcast ended, and a few minutes later, I was alone.\nI took the elevator to the ground floor to see what had transpired there. The walls of the building shone with a soft shimmering light, save for a silver gate which stood where the doorway had been. In a room behind I found a bed.\nKneeling beside it, I folded my hands and spoke to the air. \"It has begun again. Peace be with you.\" I cut my prayer to that, and lay down on the bed to wait. Closing my eyes, I dreamed of Judas, so long ago.\nSeven hours later there came a knock at the gate. I sat up, and knew the first had arrived. No one else in the world could have knocked. Looking out, I saw television cameras pointing toward the gate. Apparently, no one but those chosen could even get to the gate, held back by some force no mortal power could ignore. It wasn't important to me though. What was important was the woman who stood at the door.\nA woman. My mind left me for a moment, then calmed. I had not expected a woman; there had been no women before. Apparently I, too, had something left to learn; I wondered how much. I opened the gate for her.\nShe stood her distance undecidedly.\n\"Speak your word!\" I made the command harsh. There would be time for understanding later. It was the command she had been waiting for.\n\"Power,\" she said softly, then waited expectantly.\n\"That is incorrect,\" I said. \"If you follow me, I can teach you why.\"\nShe did not hesitate. The gate closed silently behind us, and my apprehension calmed. I knew exactly when the one I was waiting for would be arriving, but even so I was glad that he was not the first. However, I had another task to attend to here, and so I led the woman to a back room. Within, I began to teach her what all mankind needed to know. She was named Mary, an interesting coincidence---if anything could be considered coincidence.\nIt was only an hour before the second one arrived. The crowd outside hushed as he approached, so Mary and I knew even before the knock came. She remained behind, while I opened the gate again. This time, it was a man, and he calmly spoke even before I prompted him.\n\"Life,\" he said.\nI turned away. \"Wrong. Follow me if you would learn why.\"\nThe answer was not all that far off, but I didn't explain it to Jose until we were inside. There I began my teachings again, in earnest.\nSlowly, time passed, and daytime approached. I knew, as none of the people outside did, that there would be no sun this day. Night was eternal, until the game was finished. Still, I counted this day as one of my three. The ending was still inevitable. I only wished that I knew it.\nThe knock came again, and I knew who stood there. \"Get back in there,\" I commanded Mary and Jose, directing them to a back room. They complied with full understanding. I had explained some of what was to come, so much of it as I knew.\nI opened the gates. Five men stood outside with automatic rifles pointed at me. They could not pass the gates, but it didn't stop their bullets. One looked at me with something like a sneer.\n\"Die, thief,\" he commented as he pulled the trigger. The others followed suit, and I bent forward as the bullets struck me one after another for a long time.\nWhen the guns were empty, I stood up, showing myself to be unharmed. Their faces were pictures of terror, except for the one I wanted, in back. His name was Greg, and his eyes showed sudden understanding. \"Love,\" he said.\nI nodded. \"Yes. Follow me to hear more.\" Even as he followed me in, a few stars twinkled again in the night sky that should not have been there.\nScott arrived an hour later, incorrectly guessing \"Honesty.\" Linda did not appear for almost six thereafter, but her word of \"Peace\" was correct. Samuel guessed \"Faith\" incorrectly, and was admitted as well. At the hour that would have been nightfall had night ever lifted, I returned to the gate. The people outside were silent as I spoke. \"Peace and Love. Tell me more.\" The time approached, and suddenly I knew it had come.\nOne man materialized in the back of the crowd, but no one noticed. I did not smile---I had been waiting for him. For almost two thousand years, I had been waiting for this one man. I only knew it in that instant.\n\"Trust,\" he shouted. I opened my gate for him with a feeling akin to fear. Although I had known he was coming, and had prepared for him, seeing his face again after two thousand years was still a shock. The word he had chosen bit me, but it was one of those I was looking for. Something the world needed more of.\n\"Correct,\" I said, and together Judas and I closed the gate. He looked at me suspiciously, but I kept my gaze even. He finally avoided my eyes altogether. Still, he knew the lessons I was teaching well, and helped in the instruction. I could not fault him there. Those things which were new, he listened to attentively.\nLater, as I lay down to sleep, I shivered. Judas was the reason for the game, and I was uncertain of the result.\nSix more people arrived over the next day and a half, none of them guessing correct words. It would not have mattered if they had; the board was now set and all that remained was for the game to end. Mary, Greg, Scott, Linda, Samuel, Judas, Jose, Judith, Sarah, Thomas, Peter and Paul. The Peter, Paul, Mary, and Judas I wondered about, but coincidence or lack of same was not my most pressing concern.\nOn the third day, I showed them how to open the gate, and went to lay down.\nJudas left, as I knew he would. He spoke with another man outside. I knew the terms too well by this point. Thirty small ingots of silver to do me in, as had thirty coins before. It was a strange bargain in these days, but one which Judas would understand; he was not fully aware of the progress of two thousand years. After a while, he returned, and joined the rest of the disciples. He was carrying two small pouches, and one jingled with silver. I nearly wept. It had been so long. And to still betray my teachings, even now.\nI set a table, and on it appeared many foods. I left the disciples to their meal as I took the elevator to the top of the building.\nFrom above, I could see the people milling about in throngs below, and felt my time running low. An hour was all I had left, but my time had been enough. Those who sat at my table below held the knowledge that would save mankind for another thousand years or so, if the world was smart enough to use it. My innate faith in man was that they would.\nI was glad that one of my purposes had been fulfilled. The other would cost me my life, and perhaps the last chance at peace I had. Thinking of Judas, I returned to my table.\n\"Trust, love, peace, hope, evil.\" With each word, a portion of the stars in the night sky glowed once again where they belonged. \"Remember these words, and the ideas that they are keys to. My time here is nearly up, but when I am dead your task begins. Humanity will need your teaching as you needed mine. I shall not return for a thousand years---use the intervening time well.\" Each of them at last realized who I truly was, and together we raised a toast to humanity.\nAs I brought the wine glass to my lips, I saw Judas move. The motion was lightning quick, as he raised his own glass and hurled it. The shouted \"No!\" still hung in the air as the two glasses collided. Mine fell to the table, somehow still upright.\nI looked at him, and the rest fell into silence.\n\"Poison in the glass,\" Judas said, then got up and went to the gate. Opening it, he opened the bag of silver and scattered it to the crowd with a gesture, then dropped the bag and returned. He stood before me, and would not meet my glance.\nI smiled. \"God forgives you,\" I said.\nHe shifted uncomfortably, waiting. I poured the poisoned wine onto the floor, and tossed away the glass. It shattered musically in the corner, and the silence with it.

Nestrosa's was a classy place, with all-real, classy food and classy patrons, but although being a senior War Council member earned him the right to dine there, Quarq did not feel the part of a classy guy.\nHe was not sure why he had come that evening. True, he loved the pure, culinary enjoyment and almost primitive appeal that could only come from attacking a juicy, fleshy steak of real meat from some poor dead herd animal slaughtered somewhere on the wide ranges of Planet Druusca, but tonight he for some reason found himself yearning to be dressed in his battered fatigues with his feet up on the table, enjoying a huge malt in a greasy fast food joint.\n``Would you care to order now, sir?'' said a cultured voice at his side. Coming out of his thoughts, he saw one of the waiters standing patiently at his table, pen and order pad at the ready.\n``Sure,'' he replied. ``I'll have the steak.''\n``And would you like anything to drink, sir?''\nThe captain was tempted to ask for a malt, just to see what the waiter's reaction would be, then changed his mind and replied, ``Give me a twelve-year, straight up, no ice.''\n``Very good, sir,'' said the waiter. He picked up the menu and headed for the kitchen.\nQuarq leaned back in his chair and stared out one of Nestrosa's huge view windows. It overlooked the surrounding area of the Capitol District, an area filled with subtly-lit theaters, hotels, business towers, and government offices. Off to one side, the evening lights sparkled on the waters of the local reservoir.\nGazing a little farther, the captain's eyes skirted the fringes of the wealthy sector, where the moderately affluent, including himself, made their homes. He lived in a moderately-sized, comfortable building, in the least elaborate, most standard apartment he could find, which was still too large and too done up for his tastes. His eyes traveled still farther into the distance, where he could make out the shrinking band of middle class neighborhoods he had come from. He would have rather lived there, among familiar faces and places, but his rank forced him to remain within a specified radius of the Imperial Grounds. He would have even almost preferred standard officer's quarters on the local Space Navy base to his current residence, but such uncouth behavior was simply not permitted from a Fleet Captain.\nHis peers never could quite grasp his discomfort with high society; they wondered why a man with his size paycheck was living in such ``humble'' accommodations and eating standard synthetic food when he could very easily afford much more. As far as they were concerned, they, as well as he, had earned the right to the good life and all of its privileges.\nWhat it all amounted to in the end was that Quarq did not care for frivolity. He saw no need to invest in twenty- year-old fashion model girlfriends, art he had no appreciation for, fancy stocks, top-level credit cards, designer clothes, and ultra-luxury hovercars (his own was a standard ten-year-old with a peeling paint job and distressed landing gear; his superior made him park it out of sight in order to avoid terminal embarrassment). There was only one frivolous activity he partook in, and that was the upkeep of his smoking habit.\nHe would without a second thought spend a minimum of 12,000 firas for a dozen smoke sticks, imported from one of the other planets in the Empire. That was for merchandise of the lowest standard of quality, considered ordinary cigarettes on their world of origin. His real passion, however, was found in the fragrant leaves of ``his'' brand, one of superior taste and quality, hand rolled and extra long. For this rarely-imported pleasure he would pay anywhere from 5000 to 10,000 firas a shot, depending on whether he obtained them on the market, by special order, or by somewhat more unorthodox means. He was rarely short on supply; he had good connections. Everyone else he knew thought he was crazy for continuing with a habit the general populace had considered too expensive and unhealthy to keep up decades ago. His peers found the smoke sticks nothing but a waste of money; it was not a liquid asset like a car or a piece of art, and once you used it, it was gone forever. Quarq would merely reply that smoking gave him a unique satisfaction, while fancy apartments full of material wealth did not, and what made him happy, not them happy, was what mattered to him.\nDespite the frivolity of his habit, he was not frivolous in its use. A dozen smoke sticks would normally last him for months; he was a disciplined man who stuck to his self- imposed ``one-at-the-end-of-the-week-only'' rule exceptionally well.\nThe waiter returned with his drink and set it down on the table. As Quarq sipped at it, he saw a large group of young men, accompanied by a girl who seemed rather uncomfortable in her high heels and sequined dress, arrive at the reception desk and announce that they were the Sarq Artists and Art Appreciation Club. The headwaiter located their name in his reservation book and escorted them to a large table set off to one side. Quarq watched as the group was led across the restaurant floor. It was led by two people in particular: one, an effeminately handsome man of indeterminate age; the other was the tallest drinking straw the captain had ever seen. He snorted and took another mouthful of his drink. Artists.\nAs he watched the unusual bunch assemble, he smiled faintly (it was indeed a smile; one had to be careful when interpreting Quarq's facial expressions, as a scar, partially obscured by his moustache and running parallel to his upper lip, pulled at the right corner of his mouth, often making it appear as if he were sneering). Goddamn rich brats, he thought, I don't see you getting drafted. Indeed, he assumed, these were privileged children. He wondered how often the family servants put non-synthetic or prime synthetic food on their tables, while the majority of the populace was reared on overpriced, standard synthetic foodstuffs.\nHis personal waiter returned, set a steak down in front of him, and, after being told that no, Quarq did not care for anything more, thank you, left without a word. The captain stared at the steak and began to feel guilty. Guilty and ashamed for thinking hypocritical thoughts and taking advantage of the privileged life. His appetite vanished. He sat staring at his dinner for a long time. He began to think of the war in Thy, and the food shortages it had caused here in the Capitol District. He recalled that another member of the War Council had joked earlier in the day that perhaps if they waited long enough, the local revolutionaries would starve themselves out of existence.\nAs he continued to stare at the steak he sneered (this time it was quite obviously a sneer, one quite frightfully enhanced by the very same scar which had skewed his smile) in disgust, both at himself and at the state of things in general. He decided he would eat the steak, but only because in this day and age it was a sin to waste food. He would force himself to eat his meal, to swallow his hypocrisy. And when he had choked down the last detestable bite he would vow never to come to this or any privilege-class restaurant, and never to eat real food again.\nHe started on his dinner, eating it slowly, looking at it as little as possible. He ordered several more drinks. He also continued to observe the artists' club.\nHe noticed that, over the course of a couple of hours, they had ordered just about everything on the menu; the multi-course meals, the fresh breads and hot soups, salads tossed with fresh greens and other vegetables (a rare and expensive treat), the finest wines in the house. Then, just when it seemed they had finally gorged themselves, they asked for the dessert menu.\nThis is some club banquet, Quarq thought, and chuckled. Wait til their parents get their credit card bills.\nAs the group worked their way through a multitude of desserts, various club members began to deliver speeches. Although no one else in Nestrosa's paid them any heed, Quarq struggled to listen. Oddly, he found that most of the orations were seemingly nonsensical, almost ridiculous. And now, was he imagining things, or was that queer-looking fellow telling the human straw and several others about the relationship between hovercar mechanics and interior design?\nQuarq frowned, finished off his drink, and surveyed the array of empty glasses on both his and the artists' tables. He came to three conclusions. Either he did not know a meaningful conversation on modern art when he heard it, the kids were drunk, or he was drunk. Probably more than one of the above.\nAfter a while, one of the waiters approached the artists' table and inquired if they were done. The effeminate replied that they were. ``And how would you care to pay?'' the waiter then asked.\n``Well, gosh, sir,'' the walking straw replied, ``I seem to have forgotten my wallet.''\n``Me too,'' chimed in several of the others.\nThe waiter looked annoyed. ``How would you care to pay?'' he repeated.\n``We wouldn't,'' said the effeminate artist, and pulled a gun on the man. At his table, Quarq arched his eyebrows and tried to hold back a laugh. His mouth curved into a crooked, tight-lipped smile. For some reason he found the idea of a prissy queer holding up a waiter quite amusing.\n``I say, sir!'' yelped the poor waiter as his antagonist gripped him in a headlock. The drinking straw pulled a compact laser sub-machine gun from his jacket and fired off several shots at the ceiling. A large crystal chandelier plummeted down into the seafood tank. The patrons screamed.\n``Whoops,'' said the straw, looking a bit sheepish.\nUnable to hold back any longer, Captain Quarq doubled over and began to laugh.\n``NOBODY MOVE!'' the straw bellowed as he recovered from his embarrassment. Behind him, the rest of the ``club members'' pulled weapons from beneath their jackets. The young lady reached into her dress and produced a small handgun from the cleft between her breasts.\nWhen Quarq saw this his eyes began to water. He nearly fell off of his chair.\nSeveral of the young men ran into the kitchen and shooed out the cooks. When they, along with the waiters and the manager, had been gathered together at the center of the floor, the tall, skinny youth spoke up again.\n``Alright... take-out crew: kitchenward... march!'' he snapped. Half a dozen of his fellows disappeared into the kitchen.\n``W-wait a minute--'' began the manager.\n``Shut up! All of you, shut up!'' (Somehow, Quarq managed to contain himself.) ``Now listen: we don't want to hurt anyone, so don't try anything. While my friends are busy in the kitchen, the rest of us will relieve you of your jewelry, watches, credit cards, money--hic!--size sixteen- and-a-half narrow shoes, and your firstborn children. You will be generous. Is that clear?''\nA small, nervous-looking fellow leaned close to the straw. ``You never said anything about robbing them!'' he hissed.\n``Shuddup, Flarax. Go cover those tables over there.'' The other reluctantly did as he was told.\nAs the Sarq's Artists and Art Appreciation Club proceeded to collect the patrons' valuables (as well their unfinished bottles of champagne and wine), Quarq began to take more careful notice of the youths' appearances. With the exception of the girl and the effeminate man, most of them seemed gaunt and tired. His smirk momentarily faded as he recalled for a second time what his comrade had said: if we wait long enough, the revolutionaries will starve themselves out of existence.\nThe captain's weathered face softened. The poor kids. They may be on the wrong track but they've got guts and spunk. I'll at least give them credit for that.\nMeanwhile, the young man who had been called Flarax, not so much nervous as ticked off now, sighed as he slowly paced the floor. As he passed Quarq's table for a third time, he halted, turned, and took keen notice of the man. He stared at the captain, his eyes narrowed, his brow furrowed in thought. There was something intriguing about this person, something about the face which might have been handsome if it were not so weathered, something about the narrow moustache broken up by so many scars it seemed scraggly.\nThe captain stared back. Flarax did not like this. The older man's gaze chilled him. His right eye was a deep golden hue, sharp with intelligence, but the left... The young man shuddered. The iris was slightly misshapen, pale yellow about the edges, the color fading to nearly white in the center. The pupil was askew, fixed to a small, hazy opening.\n``Yes?'' Quarq asked slowly, smiling a bit (although to Flarax it was an evil sneer which perfectly complimented the eye). The captain studied the boy. So this is one of those local terrorists, eh? He certainly did not seem like a subversive killer. Then again, Quarq did not believe most of the revolutionaries to be subversive, bloodthirsty killers to begin with. The youth was small, a little on the scrawny side, with a pleading expression and a baby face topped with unruly curls. He seemed to be the sort of young man high school girls would deem ``So-o-o-o-o cute!''\n``Uh ... '' Flarax began. Not knowing what else to say, he replied, ``Have--have we met?''\nThe captain blinked slowly. ``I don't think so,'' he responded blandly.\n``Oh.'' A pause. ``Uh ... got any, you know, valuables?''\n``Nope.''\n``Money?''\n``Credit card, but it's got an unauthorized user code. If I call it in to the credit company, and then you try to use it in the store, the register alarms'll go off, and your ass'll be fried.'' Quarq paused, then added, ``Besides, I have to pay for my meal, kid.''\n``Yeah, okay,'' Flarax replied distantly, and sighed again. He stood silently, his weapon at the ready.\nPresently the young men who had invaded the kitchen emerged, carrying sackloads of food over their shoulders.\n``No, no ... ,'' the manager groaned.\n``Yes, yes,'' the human straw replied. ``Alright, people!'' he cried, speaking up to the patrons again, ``Thank you very, very much for the lovely meals, the cash, and all your little baubles.'' He stopped to take a swig from a bottle of wine. ``Anyway,'' he went on, returning his attention to the crowd, ``We'd love to stay and chat, but we really must be going. We have art to appreciate, you know. I don't recommend you following us.'' He waved his arm and the other revolutionaries gathered at the exit, covering the crowd. ``Goodnight, folks--it's been lovely.'' He headed toward the door with the effeminate man, who paused to pinch the cheek of the headwaiter on his way out.\nOnce they were gone, the manager sprang into action. ``You there!'' he snapped, ``Call the police! And you lot--go look out the windows and see if you can spot their vehicles!'' His eyes pinpointed Quarq at the far end of the room. Being familiar with most of the military officers who frequented Nestrosa's, he quickly approached the captain. ``Captain Quarq, sir!'' he snapped, ``Those were those revolutionary scoundrels, were they not?''\nQuarq nodded. ``I believe they were.''\n``Then why the hell didn't you do something, man!''\n``Do what?'' the captain replied coolly, ``I'm unarmed at the moment. Not to mention, of course, that there were at least twenty of them and only one of me.''\nThe manager exhaled sharply, calmed himself, but remained curt. ``I see. I'm sorry. Would you please notify the Elite Police immediately? You may use the reception desk phone. This way, sir.'' He hurried off toward the entrance.\nQuarq sighed, smiled, and shook his head. At length he got up from his seat and followed the man. He was not in a hurry.\nFaye Levine is an Art\/Design Freshman at Carnegie Mellon University.

There was none. Perfect, he thought, everything's working out perfect. He frowned and added as an afterthought, Too perfect. He glanced down at his workbench littered with drill bits, screwdrivers, random-sized pieces of wire, textbooks. Jonny smiled, reassured. In his right hand, he still clenched his Mitsubishi power drill. He looked back at the mirror.\nHe had been letting his hair grow unchecked for the last year, anxiously awaiting the day it would be long enough to completely cover his forehead. Jonny squinted at his reflection. Again, he could catch no sign of what lay covered beneath the wave of hair that flopped down past his eyebrows. He let out a short, sharp laugh.\nThey all said I was mad, Jonny thought. Said it right to my face. A combined major in electrical engineering, computer science, and neurobiology was insane, they exclaimed. Pure lunacy! And why such a major? All for an obsession with science fiction. I should be committed, they hollered.\nWait till they get their next phone bills, Jonny thought, then we'll see who's mad. He snickered at his pun.\nHe put down the drill and triumphantly swept his hair clear of his forehead, letting the sight of his newly-installed chrome modular jack dazzle him. The bleeding had stopped, and his skin bulged slightly and curled in against the cool metallic surface. It's beautiful, Jonny thought.\nHe picked up his well-worn copy of `Neuromancer' and headed to the kitchen, where he pulled a six-pack of Coke from the refrigerator. He went back to his bedroom, closing and locking the door behind him to assure his privacy from any jeering house-mates who might happen to barge in for a laugh.\nHe flopped onto his bed, pulled off a Coke, and chugged it down, impatiently waiting for the caffeine to hit his system. He threw the empty can across the room, watching the light reflect off the damp aluminum as it arced toward his recycling bin\/laundry basket. The can landed, clattering loudly, and Jonny pulled off another Coke.\nAfter the third can, he could feel nerves begin to twitch.\nJonny bounded out of bed, picked up his phone, and settled down in front of the wall. He turned the phone over and unplugged the jack; then he put the phone aside. He reached over to his bed and picked up his copy of `Neuromancer', tucking it snugly under his shirt, next to his heart. He twisted his legs into the lotus position. Now he was ready. With a trembling hand, Jonny positioned the plug just inside his jack. His heart pounding out of control, he broke out in a cold sweat as he jacked in.\nAnd he screamed as his senses seemed to explode. Blinding chaos surged around him, howling in his ears, digging into the pit of his stomach. His arms flailed about, and his head jerked back then snapped forward.\nWhen Jonny opened his eyes, he was sprawled on the floor in his room, his clothes drenched with sweat. His head pounded as if an alien larva was trying to escape the confines of his skull. He tried to sit up, but the room spun crazily around him, and he ended up flat on his back again. He waited a minute, taking several deep breaths, and tried again, this time succeeding. He looked at the wall jack, the phone cord spilling out of it and ending several feet away. He gingerly touched his chrome jack. I must have hit the cord with my arm and pulled it out, Jonny thought.\nThen he tried to remember what had happened when he'd jacked in. He shivered. What I need, he concluded as he got up and headed to his bed, is more caffeine. He pulled off another can and gulped the Coke resolutely. After finishing off another, Jonny went back to the phone jack, bringing the last can with him. He was really wired now. This time, he plugged himself in without a moment's hesitation.\nThere was no chaos. Instead, he found himself in the middle of what looked to be a computer-generated image of a forest. From a dark green, pulsating ground sprouted hundreds of brown cylinders, complete with clusters of light green leaves surrounding the tops. There was absolutely no sound, but when he closed his eyes, Jonny could imagine the loa whispering through the treetops on a cybernetic breeze. Man, Jonny thought, this is SO cool. It's beautiful, just beautiful.\nAn idea dawned on him just then. William Gibson's phone number ought to be here, he thought. I've got to call him, tell him everything! He could feel himself clutch `Neuromancer' tightly to his chest. Yes, Jonny concluded, Gibson must know about this.\nBut, first things first. He'd have his revenge on his tormenters. He guessed that each tree handled a different function, that the leaves were data structures, and that the pulses flashing this way and that beneath his feet were messages being passed from tree to tree. So, keeping a lookout for any security programs, he moved cautiously towards the closest tree. When he reached it, he noticed a faint red tinge on the trunk. Probably security stuff, Jonny thought warily.\nHe carefully concentrated on the security system, and a few moments later Jonny had the program in mind. Scanning through the code, he deftly added a few lines to the program, thereby effecting it to ignore him. Jonny smirked. I rule here now, he thought.\nHe poked his head into the tree, and gasped. Billions of tiny bits of information skittered this way and that, like snow on a Sony television set. Jonny blinked a few times, then began to think intently. Soon, the tree's purpose presented itself: call waiting. Incredible, he thought, but not what I'm after. Jonny left the tree, marking it for future reference, and went around to the others.\nA half hour later, he found the tree that handled billing information. After a few moments, Jonny figured out how to manipulate the data. He concentrated on his friends' phone numbers, reached into the data with his mind, and went to work. He added hours to the time spent on long distance calls, increased their rates, and tacked on more surcharges. That would show them, he thought, giggling.\nHe noticed as he exited the tree that the red tinge on its bark was spreading, moving towards him. That's odd, Jonny thought, did the security program notice me? I thought I'd fixed it.\nThen the red tinge jumped. Translucent red tendrils grabbed hold of him and reached into his mind. Violent, chaotic thoughts raced through Jonny's head. But one thought rose above all the frenzied nonsense, and that thought was to spread, reproduce itself, no matter what the cost.\nJonny gasped in horror and revulsion as he realized was being invaded by a computer virus. He instinctively slammed down mental walls and lashed out at any remaining traces of virus.\nThe red tinge retreated back to the tree.\nI bet it wasn't expecting anything like THAT, thought Jonny. He then marked the tree and left for a clearing in the forest in order to think.\nA virus? he pondered. Why would someone put a virus in the phone network? Then again, why WOULDN'T someone put a virus in the phone network? A bored student, a professional hacker--could be almost anybody. Normally I wouldn't really give a damn, Jonny thought, but this virus attacked ME. He sighed, and then concluded, I can't let my cyberspace be overrun with these things.\nJonny smirked. From a cyberpunk to a cybercop.\nGibson just HAD to hear about this.\nAs he made his way back to that last tree, Jonny allocated himself a large chunk of RAM, wrote a search program keyed to the virus's code, and let it run. With the leftover memory, he made a box and fiddled with the access codes so that it could only be written into, not read from. Write-Only Memory. Jonny snickered.\nThe red tinge had been piling up on the ground next to him while he worked and showed no signs of stopping. He checked on the progress of his program and sighed. It would take many more minutes to finish.\nJonny sat down, and a wave of exhaustion swept over him. Damn, he thought, I can't afford to lose my mental edge; a mistake now could prove fatal. So he concentrated, felt his hand move to his forehead, and he jacked out.\nJonny opened his eyes, stared at the wall of his room, then slowly looked around. Everything--the unmade bed, the cluttered desk, the stained drapes--everything looked drab all of a sudden. Hmm, he thought. Then he shrugged, shotgunned the last Coke, and jacked back in.\nHe stood in the forest, next to his WOM box. The mound of red tinge reached his chest level. He checked on his program and found that it had ended successfully.\nAs Jonny reached forward to begin shoveling the virus into the box, the red tinge shifted, moved, sent out pseudopodia which coalesced into arms, legs, and a head, and became Richard Nixon.\nJonny screamed in terror and jumped back. This couldn't be happening, he thought frantically.\nThe Nixon figure crossed its arms and said, \"Let's be reasonable, Jonny. I'm sure we can work something out.\"\nJonny cringed. \"But-- but-- you're a virus!\"\nA shocked, insulted look came over Nixon's features. Nixon then lifted up his hands, his fingers in peace symbols, and said, shaking his head, \"I am not a virus.\"\nJonny scratched his head.\nAnd Nixon lunged, howling, arms outstretched, three-inch blades protruding from its fingertips. It grabbed hold of Jonny and squeezed hard, trying to rip his mind to shreds.\nJonny shrieked, backed away, and tried to slam down his mental walls. But this time he was too late, the virus had too strong of a grip. His mind was overcome with those destructive thoughts, and he struggled to keep a hold onto a part of himself in order to reach out, to do something against the virus.\nHe writhed in agony as he felt his brain being turned into cheese- whiz. He was vaguely aware of himself muttering, \"I am not a virus. I am not a virus. Kill. Kill. Destroy.\"\nThen that last dose of caffeine hit his system, and he managed to grasp the WOM box. With a dopamine and adrenaline surge, Jonny lifted up his box and slammed it down on the virus. It screamed, tried to climb out, tried to re-establish the grip on Jonny's mind that it had abruptly lost. He slammed down the lid, sealed it.\nThen Jonny deleted the box, contents and all.\nHe sighed and leaned heavily against the nearby tree. As quickly as the caffeine jolt had hit him it faded away. I need another Coke, he thought wearily.\nJonny wandered about the forest in a daze. After what seemed days, he collapsed against the base of a tree. He peered inside instinctively and saw it was the main long-distance handling tree. At random, he picked a phone number, heard a ringing, and waited for someone to answer.\nA minute later, there was a click, and then a voice that said, \"Hello? William Gibson speaking.\"\nJonny's eyes shot open, and he could feel a second wind starting to blow strong within himself. He committed the number to memory and jacked out.\nRobert Hurvitz is a student at UC Berkeley. His only other published story, `The Big Joke', appeared in the December '90 issue of Quanta. He wrote `Jonny Neurotic' 2 to 3 years ago and was content to let it sit compressed in a deeply nested subdirectory, but, after Dan's heartfelt plea for submissions, Robert dusted it off and sent it along.\nhurvitz@cory.berkeley.edu","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

His face was stretched over sharp, high cheekbones, not quite sunken, but not quite healthy, either. His eyes were a deep yellow, almost orange. They were cold and reflecting, very alert, very intelligent. Very shrewd. The mind behind the eyes did not particularly care about the body which had barely gotten it through the Space Navy physical. That did not matter. What mattered was that it functioned. What mattered was that the man had graduated first in his class at Tansar, the top Space Naval academy, with a multitude of honors, and was now a very successful and respected Lieutenant Commander at the scant age of twenty-five.\nHis name was Keezor Gemcutter. He did not care for the handle. His registered go-by was Keezor, and that helped a bit, since he never went out of his way to announce his too-quaint family name, or the fact that it meant he had come from a thousand year-old line of jewelers. It was not that he was embarrassed of his heritage; it was simply that \"Gemcutter\" was really not at all a proper name for an officer. It had no power, no strength. \"Keezor,\" on the other hand, had a certain edge to it, which is why he had insisted on being called by it since he was a child. He knew very well how important image was, and realized that if he could not be a physical presence, he could at least be a psychological one.\nHis father had long been irked over his refusal to go by the family name, and even more irked over his decision to throw away the years his son had spent apprenticed to him in favor of joining the Space Navy. His mother had simply whined, in a typical motherly fashion, that he was not strong enough. In the end, he had come to terms with his father, and had proved his mother wrong: his somewhat frail body had somehow weathered the physical hardships, and his mind had passed every test with flying colors.\nKeezor was an intelligent man, highly so. He knew it.\nThe average Space Navy recruit, even if they had come from an academy, was just that: average.\nThat was why he joined.\nHis opinion was this: They needed him, and they knew it. He did not deny his ego. He knew he was good, and he was damn proud of it. He did not, however, lower himself to bragging. Boasting was bad etiquette, a sign of insecurity, and a way to make others believe you were lying. Keezor revered proper behavior and stood on solid ground. As far as he was concerned, bragging in any form was unnecessary. He preferred to prove himself through his actions, which he had in fact done on numerous occasions.\nKeezor was largely a solitary man, or more accurately, a recluse. He was not altogether antisocial, but preferred to be alone, exercising his mind. His bedroom at home was his palace; he spent the majority of his time during leaves there. It was his private sanctuary. He usually did not let anyone in, not even his mother. She had rarely needed to go into his room even when he was a boy, mostly because he kept it so meticulously clean and neat.\nPeople thought he was strange. Likeable, respectable, but strange. He did not care. He lived his life the way he liked it best: orderly, properly, and, when possible, alone.\n2. Two\nIt was dark in his sanctuary tonight. The whole room was wrapped in shadows, save for a bright light over a table. Sitting at the table was Keezor, a large book open before him. Situated on the table was a perfect, scaled down terrain dotted with the troops of two armies prepared to do battle.\nTonight was the last night of a one-week leave. He had spent all day setting up for the battle, deciding that it would be a pleasant way to end his short vacation.\nKeezor loved history, especially historical battles. The workings of armies and navies had fascinated him for as long as he could remember. His shelves were filled with books containing detailed accounts of battles from the decade he lived in to millennia past. He believed in learning from history, from others' mistakes as well as successes. Strategy games were fine to play--he had a cabinet in his room dedicated to holding a score or more of them--but they were, after all, only games. He had already mastered a number of them, and was considered the best Stratigon player, two and three dimensional, in the hemisphere. The re-enactment of real battles, however, gave him a certain satisfaction the games could not. Through his models, he had come to learn and memorize literally hundreds of offensive and defensive strategies, and had also learned why many more had failed. Years of persistence at this hobby had made him the top-notch strategist he was.\nTonight he was field marshaling the Battle of Issai, from some three thousand years in the past, fought from chariots and riding beasts, with spears and crossbows and swords. Its primitive appearance and complex, ingenious workings made for an appealing exercise of the mind.\nKeezor was already familiar with the scenario; now he was working his way through the book in front of him, consulting maps and other information. As he read, he would move the model armies' troops through each stage of the battle, pausing to study, make notes, and take mental pictures.\nHe became so absorbed he did not notice when, sometime after midnight, the young woman sitting across from him put down the book she was reading, got up, stretched, and circled the room, her fingertips brushing the rows of wall-to-wall books on his shelves.\nHer name was Marilla. She was naturally attractive, but not beautiful, plump but not large enough to be deemed fat. Her face was perpetually friendly, shining with health and happiness.\nShe came up behind Keezor and rubbed his shoulders. He sat immobile, his eyes locked on the model. He said nothing. \"Mm, Gem...,\" she hummed. Keezor blinked at the sound of the pet name. He did not particularly like it, but he did tolerate it. \"Gem,\" Marilla repeated.\nA long pause. \"Hm,\" Keezor replied, and continued to contemplate the model.\nThe girl kissed the top of his head and continued to rub his arms, neck and shoulders. \"Are you going to do that all night, Gem?\"\nAnother pause. \"Mm.\"\n\"You should be spending your last night having fun.\"\nKeezor sat up a bit and paged through his book. \"I'm enjoying myself,\" he said. Marilla continued to pet him. He responded to it with indifference.\nHe had met her many years ago. She had singled him out at cafe for some unknown reason and had sat down at his table, upsetting privacy as well as his indulgence in a particularly good book. She had more or less forced a conversation on him; however, after the initial annoyance died down, he had found her pleasant enough. She had given him her phone number after several hours of chatting, and he had politely given her his own in return. He would have forgotten about her, except for the fact that she would not go away. She was not annoying, simply a bit overly friendly at first. Eventually they had grown to be friends, although exactly why Keezor did not quite understand. They had little in common. Marilla, however, was quite fond of and intrigued by him, and through a bit of devotion and persistence had managed to win a place in his small circle. She was, in fact, the only person he would allow in his room without question or hesitation.\n\"You're so thin,\" she said as she ran her hands over him. \"Don't they feed you in the Navy?\" Keezor did not reply; he had heard variations on this lecture from her as well as others a million times before. \"That reminds me...,\" Marilla went on. She left his room and came back with a wrapped plate. She took the crinkly foil off (earning a \"Sh!\" from Keezor) and set the plate down beside him. On it were a multitude of tiny pastries. \"I almost forgot about this,\" she said. \"I made them for you.\"\nIf there was one thing no one would deny about Marilla, it was that she was an excellent cook. She was also a dietician, which meant that Keezor had to endure her constant, motherly attempts to feed him properly.\nKeezor stole a glance at the desserts, then chose one at random. He nibbled at it as he made alterations to the model. It was good. Very good. He popped it in his mouth and reached for another. He downed the second pastry in several bites, then took a third. Behind him, Marilla was ecstatic. Keezor rarely did more than nibble, and he never took seconds. She embraced him from behind, snuggling as close as she could. He frowned and shrugged away. Marilla did not care.\n\"So, you like them?\" she asked, smiling broadly.\n\"Yes,\" Keezor replied, still concentrating on the model, \"They're very good.\"\n\"I'm glad,\" she told him.\nTime passed. The pair fell silent again as Keezor worked at his model. Marilla resumed her seat across the table from him, and sat watching him closely. He seemed thoroughly absorbed in his work. Then, all at once, the girl's pleasant expression dissolved into one of worry.\n\"Gem,\" she said.\n\"Hm,\" he replied without looking up from his work.\n\"Do you have to go away tomorrow?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"I mean, do you really have to go away?\"\n\"I've told you before,\" Keezor murmured patiently, \"being selected for the special program aboard the Surefire is a rare and excellent opportunity for me to advance my career.\"\n\"I know, I know,\" Marilla protested, \"but you'll be way out in space, far away, for so long! I won't be able to talk to you or anything.\"\n\"It's only for six months.\"\n\"That's forever! What am I going to do without you for six whole months?\"\n\"What do you do with me now?\"\n\"Keezor...\"\n\"You'll be alright,\" Keezor soothed, still absorbed in his battle.\n\"But I need you,\" Marilla replied quietly.\n\"You have other friends... other men...\"\n\"Other friends, but no other men, Gem, only you.\" Keezor looked up briefly. She was staring at him, sad and longing. He returned to his task.\n\"Marilla,\" he said at length, \"Are you bored?\"\n\"No,\" she replied, \"Why?\"\n\"Don't you ever get bored, sitting around here with me? You have almost no interest in what I do.\"\n\"No, never,\" Marilla sighed. \"I just like to be with you. That's enough.\"\nThere was another, longer pause. Marilla got up, came around behind him, and began to caress him again. \"When do you have to leave tomorrow?\" she asked.\n\"I have to be at the aerospaceport at 0900.\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Nine o' clock.\"\n\"Oh.\" An awkward pause. \"Gem...Do you love me?\"\nAgain Keezor looked up from his work, but gazed ahead at the wall and not at the girl. She had never asked him that before. He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them again. \"Yes,\" he replied quite frankly, \"In some bizarre way, I suppose I do.\"\nMarilla bent close and wrapped her arms around him. \"Then how about making love to me?\" she murmured, and kissed his neck. Keezor turned and looked up at her. A tender expression, usually alien to him, crossed his face.\nAs it happened Marilla was as good a lover as she was a cook, if not better.\n3. One\nThe next morning, after Marilla had embarrassed him by smothering him with good-bye hugs and kisses, Keezor made his way to his departure gate. According to his watch he had another fifteen minutes to kill before the offworld shuttle to Orbital Station One would be called for boarding.\nHis stomach was rumbling. This was rare for him, especially since he had eaten a very large breakfast. Marilla had discovered one of his little quirks: sex made him hungry. Very hungry. Ravenous. She had been rendered speechless when he had gotten up suddenly and had literally ransacked the kitchen. To her pleasure, he had gorged himself. However, he was still feeling hunger pangs.\nHe paid an outrageous sum of money for several candy bars and a drink, scarfed the food down, then went back to the gate to wait. There was a video game there; it happened to be two dimensional Space Stratigon.\nKeezor regarded the machine in distaste. He hated computers. The human mind, he felt, was so much more superior, capable of true thought, emotion, and integrity. It was the human who truly invented, thought up strategies, and made advancements. A computer was just another tool made by the human. One could claim that a box full of silicon microchips was capable of producing battle tactics, but what would the mass of wiring know about strategies at all without a human to program it? As far as Keezor was concerned, people should spend more time developing their own minds rather than allowing techno-toys to do the thinking for them.\nSince he had nothing better to do, he popped a coin into the game and selected the highest level it would allow him to start at: \"Expert\"--level ten. The screen burst into a beautiful albeit unnecessary display of astounding graphics as Keezor's and the computer's fleets materialized onto the screen.\nKeezor won in five moves.\nThe game started again, now at level eleven. Seven moves, and it was over.\nIn less than five minutes he had worked his way up to level fifteen, \"Mastery\" level. He beat the game again, this time in ten moves.\nAnother five minutes, and he was in the middle of a twentieth level game. His shuttle was called for boarding.\n`Screw this,' he thought. `Why am I wasting my time?' With a flash of bravado, he entered a move, one of his personal favorites. The game paused for a moment. The words \"SURRENDER DECLARED\" flashed on the screen.\nKeezor offered the machine a \"Hmph,\" accompanied by a patronizing smile, and left to board the shuttle.\n4. Fifty-one\nUpon arriving at Orbital Station One, Keezor consulted a station map and made his way to the docking bay where the Surefire was being kept.\nThe Surefire was a new, experimental ship featuring an extra-long cruising range and advanced anti-detection capabilities. It was well armed, but its main function was to serve as a military scout and survey ship, and, under certain circumstances, as a lesser flag ship. At least that, among other technical information, was what Keezor was told in the report he received after accepting an assignment on its first long-term space trial. There was a bit of ambiguous information as well; the Surefire had been part of something called \"Project Friend,\" and all information concerning this project was classified.\nAfter presenting his orders and identification to the security staff, Keezor was admitted to the Surefire's dock. He was mildly surprised when he saw the vessel; it was much smaller than he had imagined. Still, at least on the exterior, it was sleek and impressive. Then again, he reflected, looks sometimes were deceiving.\nAs he boarded the ship he wrinkled his nose at the \"new\" smell of the interior. He made his way to the bridge and entered. It appeared empty.\nThe Surefire's bridge was a circle, however the aft quarter of it had been walled off and made into a captain's office. Aside from the captain's chair, there were only five other stations. Port and starboard exits led into hallways.\nHe took the sight in, impressed despite its emptiness and small size, then glanced at his watch. He was precisely on time; he always was. But where was the captain and the rest of the bridge crew?\nAs if in reply to his thoughts, the sound of laughter came from behind the door of the captain's office, and a moment later four men, one in a captain's uniform emerged.\nKeezor snapped to attention. \"Lieutenant Commander Keezor reporting for duty, sir,\" he said, addressing the captain.\nThe other man smiled and returned the salute. \"Ah...,\" he said, \"At ease. So you're Keezor, eh? I've heard a lot of good things about you. I'm Captain Germayne.\" He motioned to two of the three other men. \"This is Commander Tyros, my second in command, and Commander Slaff, who's here as a consultant. The third officer here is Lieutenant Commander Anton, our detection and analysis technician.\" The four men exchanged nods of greeting. \"There's one other crewmember you have to meet before we get started,\" Germayne went on. He cocked his head slightly, and addressed the air. \"Friend?\"\n\"Yes, Captain Germayne?\" a too-pleasant, female voice replied.\nKeezor looked about. \"Who's that, sir?\"\n\"That, Keezor, is Friend, the product of Project Friend. She's the first interactive computer to be installed on one of our military vessels.\"\n\"Oh,\" Keezor replied, inwardly grimacing.\n\"Friend,\" the captain went on, \"Do you sense a new life- form reading on the bridge which has not been identified?\"\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\"Good. Commit to memory.\" Germayne turned to Keezor. State your full name, rank, and number.\"\nKeezor cleared he throat and spoke up. \"I am Lieutenant Commander Keezor Gemcutter, common name Keezor, number S-496-001-2297.\"\nThere was a slight pause. \"Identification confirmed,\" Friend informed them. \"Identification matches the on-line information for Lieutenant Commander Keezor.\"\n\"Excellent,\" Germayne smiled. \"I declare Keezor as one of my crew. Commit to memory.\"\n\"Confirmed.\" \"Now that that's settled...,\" the captain said, his attention once again on Keezor, \"Welcome aboard.\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Keezor replied.\n\"Don't get too ruffled about Friend. She takes a little getting used to, but is actually quite interesting to use. When you want or need to speak to her, just call out the name, and be sure to speak clearly. Don't use foreign words or slang.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Any questions?\"\nKeezor briefly let his gaze wander about the bridge. \"Are the five of us the entire bridge crew, sir?\"\n\"Yes and no. We rotate shifts and we do have replacements, but we're the whole official bridge crew, with the exception of the navigator. He should be coming back soon.\"\n\"Only six people on the bridge, sir?\"\n\"That's right. Between the technical advancements and Friend, the Surefire practically takes care of herself, leaving us open to focus our attention on more important things. There are only fifty-one people on board.\"\n\"I see.\"\nA man came through the port entry. \"Ah,\" said Germayne, \"Here's the navigator.\"\nKeezor turned to look at the new arrival. His face lit up. \"Sine!\" he exclaimed.\n\"Keezor!\" the other replied, \"How long has it been already?\"\n\"I take it you've met,\" Germayne observed.\n\"We went to Tansar Academy together,\" Sine explained. \"I was two years ahead of him, though.\" He smiled broadly. \"Still got that girl following you around--Gem?\" Keezor laughed and nodded.\n\"Please, gentlemen,\" the captain broke in, although not unkindly, \"Now's not the time for reunions. We're scheduled for take-off in an hour. We have plenty to do, so let's get busy.\"\nTwo months passed. Keezor grew to like the Surefire and her crew, with the exception of Friend, whom\/which he ignored whenever possible. He even insisted on doing things himself when Friend could have easily completed the task for him in a matter of seconds or minutes. While Captain Germayne did not object to Keezor's dislike and disuse of the computer, he did consider the lieutenant commander's attitude toward it somewhat severe. He was an easygoing man, however, and was content to let Keezor go about quietly exercising his mind while the rest of the crew made as much use of Friend as possible.\nFor the first time in over five years, Keezor was given the opportunity to work with Sine on special maneuvers and simulated offensive and defensive runs. The ship performed wonderfully; Sine even better. The pair spent a good portion of their free time together, doing research or playing strategy games. Sine never won, and Keezor would not let him, but the navigator was a good opponent and an even better loser.\nOne afternoon the bridge was particularly quiet. Anton and Sine manned their stations in boredom while Commanders Tyros and Slaff chatted with Captain Germayne. Keezor sat in his own place, still and proper, waiting patiently for something to happen. \"Keezor,\" Germayne spoke up, \"There's nothing for you to do now. You can leave if you'd like.\" \"No, thank you, sir,\" Keezor replied. \"I don't like leaving my post before my shift is over.\" \"If that's how you want it. How about a game of Stratigon with Friend? I hear you're an excellent player. You think you can handle her?\"\n`Not \"her\",' Keezor thought, suddenly angry, ` \"It\". And of course I can, you stupid ass. Don't insult my intelligence.'\n\"I don't know, sir,\" he replied evenly.\n\"Have a go at it,\" Slaff suggested.\n\"Yeah, why not?\" Sine offered. \"You can beat Friend. You can beat anything at Stratigon.\"\n\"Nah,\" Anton scoffed, \"She's too good.\"\n\"Ten says Keezor buries her,\" Sine challenged.\n\"Deal.\"\n\"Well?\" Captain Germayne prompted. \"Are you up to it, Keezor?\"\nKeezor's eyes flashed, more fiery orange now than amber. He cleared the computer screen in front of him. \"Friend,\" he said, loathing the name as he spoke it.\n\"Yes, Lieutenant Commander Keezor?\"\n\"Load a game of Stratigon. Three-dimensional.\"\n\"What level?\"\n\"The highest you can go.\"\n\"Level thirty,\" Friend said. The screen in front of him lit up with bright, detailed graphics. \"You may begin when ready.\"\nKeezor gave a tight-lipped half smile and cracked his knuckles. He began.\nTwenty moves later, he won.\nAs the others gaped in amazement, Anton handed his money over to a smiling Sine.\n\"Incredible,\" Germayne laughed, shaking his head. \"Do me a favor, Keezor--go get the portable set in my office and show me how the hell you did that.\"\nKeezor smiled. \"Yes, sir,\" he replied. He went into the small room and reached for the set on the captain's desk.\nFor an instant, an alarm sounded. His ears popped. There was the overwhelming sound of rushing, high speed wind, immediately followed by the crash of emergency bulkheads slamming into place.\n\"What the--?\" Keezor began. He never finished. The ship's alarms began to shriek. The ship dipped and shook. Keezor was thrown to the floor.\n\"Warning,\" Friend's quiet tones somehow managed to communicate over the din, \"Multiple hull breaches. Severe portside and lightspeed drive damage. Engines are shutting down. Repeat: Warning--Multiple hull breaches...\"\n5. Nine\nThe first thing Keezor noticed when he left Germayne's office and ran back onto the bridge was Anton's screaming, audible over the alarms. He ran to the man, who was rolling on the floor, clutching at his stomach.\n\"What happened?\" Keezor yelled at him.\n\"Port...!\" the other gagged.\nKeezor looked up. The bridge's port exit had been twisted out of shape. A bulkhead and rapidly hardening sealant closed it off. Keezor shut off the bridge's main speakers and the alarm cut off; he could now only make out the muffled sounds of it coming from outside the starboard exit, which had also been shut but not sealed. Aside from the wailing and Anton's cries, the ship seemed eerily quiet.\nConfused and shaken, Keezor looked about him. Germayne, Slaff, Tyros, and Sine were lying crumpled on floor, up against the port side of the bridge, as if they had been thrown. None of them moved. The wall was spattered with blood.\nKeezor sprang to the intercom. \"I need medics up here on the double!\" he shouted. There was no reply. He tried again, with the same results. \"Damage report!\" he called. His only answer was a static hiss. \"Engineering! Somebody!\" He turned away. \"Friend! Give me the damage.\"\n\"There are multiple breaches on the port side of the hull. Several projectiles have penetrated the ship. Navigation is functioning at seventy-two percent efficiency. The lightspeed engine is currently unoperational. Long range radio is unoperational and short range radio has been damaged. A priority distress beacon has been activated.\"\n\"Is the intercom functioning?\"\n\"Affirmative.\"\n`Oh God,' Keezor thought frantically, `then if none of the decks are answering...' He ran past Anton and over to the others. He didn't need medic's training to tell him Germayne, Slaff, and Tyros were dead. Sine was breathing-- just. Keezor pulled out the bridge's medical kit. He stood stupidly for a moment, unsure who he should go to first, Sine or Anton. Anton was still screaming, and now, as he looked more closely, he could see that the man was bleeding badly.\nHe ran to Anton and pried the man's hands away from his stomach. His clothing was soaked with blood.\n\"Get it out! Get it out!\" Anton shrieked at him.\n\"What? Get what out?\"\n\"Shrapnel...oh, shit...forceps...dig...find it!\"\n\"But I--\"\n\"DO IT!\"\nKeezor hesitated, then tried to call for a medic again. Once again, he received no reply.\n\"They're dead, you stupid fucker!\" Anton screamed. \"HELP ME!\"\nHis hands shaking, Keezor returned to Anton and fumbled through the large box until he found forceps. He tore away Anton's clothes, then abruptly turned away and vomited. Gagging, he gulped in several breaths of air, turned back to his comrade, and tentatively began to search through the man's flesh. Eventually he found what he was looking for. Deep down he could just make out the tip of a piece of metal. Swallowing hard, he reached in and pulled it out, then emptied an entire can of sterile, staunching spray foam into the gory hole. He dressed the wound as quickly and as tightly as he could.\n\"Muh...,\" Anton gasped, \"Morphine...\"\n\"Uh...,\" Keezor almost whimpered, \"Y-yeah.\" He found a small packet of syringes pre-loaded with the drug, and pulled one out. \"Where--where do I--?\"\n\"ANYWHERE!\"\nKeezor forced himself to stop shaking long enough to locate a vein and slide the needle home. After a short time Anton's wailing began to subside. Keezor left him and ran over to Sine. The navigator lay twisted on the floor, but he was afraid to touch him for fear of worsening any internal injuries he might already have.\n\"Friend,\" he called as he sat wondering what to do, \"What happened?\"\n\"Early warning systems detected a sizeable incoming mass traveling at too high a rate of closure for any reaction other than a spectrograph analysis and one automatic defensive action. The spectrograph indicated that the mass in question was ice, however as the port lasers fired to break the mass into non-threatening units, the spectrograph also indicated the presence of iron beneath the ice. There was insufficient time left for further reaction. Five iron masses have struck and penetrated the port hull of the ship.\"\n\"A piece pierced the port corridor,\" Anton grimaced. \"I took a hit and fell, but... the air... was sucked from... starboard to port... for an instant before the bulkheads closed. The others... picked up... thrown...\"\nKeezor nodded. \"Friend, give me the status of the medical wing.\"\n\"The medical wing took a critical hit.\"\n\"Oh, God... Status of--no. Friend, how many life-form readings do you currently have aboard this ship?\"\n\"One moment.\" A pause, then: \"Nine.\"\nKeezor sank to his knees. \"Oh God, oh God...,\" he muttered over and over.\nThe starboard bulkhead suddenly opened and six men ran in. One Keezor recognized instantly. He was Lieutenant Ryde, one of the shift leaders from engineering.\n\"The captain--?\" he began.\n\"Dead,\" Keezor told him. \"And Slaff and Tyros, too. Sine and Anton are in bad shape.\"\n\"Uh...\" one of the other men broke in, \"Anton's dead.\"\n\"Wha--?\" Keezor gasped. He had not noticed the man had stopped wailing. \"Oh, fuck,\" he muttered under his breath. He realized he was on his knees on the floor, shaking and dazed, certainly not the way he should be behaving. He pulled himself together and stood up. \"Our distress beacon's on--the long range radio's out,\" he informed the others, forcing himself to stand straight and his voice to stop wavering. \"Navigation's intact, but not fully operational.\"\n\"And what about you?\" Ryde asked him.\nFor a moment Keezor froze, then realized it was an innocent question. \"I was in Germayne's office when it happened. I'm okay. And you?\"\n\"We were all sleeping. I guess we just got lucky.\" Ryde glanced at Sine's still form. He approached the navigator, very gently felt his neck, and peeled back one of his eyelids. \"Is there cervical collar in that kit there?\"\nKeezor looked. \"No.\"\n\"Okay.\" Ryde looked up at the others. \"Javis, Daq--go see if you can scrounge one up, or something that'll keep this guy's head still. Try to get something hard and flat to put him on, too.\" The two men nodded and left the bridge.\n\"Is it very bad?\" Keezor asked, surprised at how calm his voice had suddenly become.\n\"Well, I'm not an authority, but I did have some training once. He's comatose. Looks like he's got some bad head injuries, probably neck injuries, too. But like I said, I'm not a doctor. Could be better, could be worse.\"\nAfter Sine had been attended to and the bodies had been cleared away, Ryde and his companions decided to go to engineering to assess the damage. Keezor remained on the bridge, returned to the captain's office, and made a log entry:\nDate: fifteenth day of Third Month. Lieutenant Commander Keezor reporting.\nNot long ago the ship's hull was breached in five places by chunks of iron from a fragmented mass the spectrograph initially interpreted to be ice. There was no time for reaction; the whole matter was taken care of by the computer's emergency defense system. I don't think any of us realized what had happened until after the impact, when the alarms started going off.\nThe bridge crew, with the exception of myself and Lieutenant Commander Sine, has died as a result of injuries received when one of the iron masses punctured the ship near the bridge. Sine is down with head and neck injuries.\nThe Surefire has been badly damaged. Life support systems appear to be functioning normally and all damaged areas have been sealed off. Navigational systems are not fully operational; long range radio is out and short range radio has been damaged. Our priority distress beacon is on. The medical wing has been more or less destroyed and the lightspeed drive is currently unoperational.\nThere are only eight of us left--nine if you count Friend, which I don't. Friend does not appear to be malfunctioning.\nThe other survivors are from engineering: Lieutenants Ryde, Javis, and Daq, Sergeant Yoriq, and Second Lieutenants Eral and Wellow. They have gone to see if the lightspeed drive is repairable. More later.\nEnd of entry.\nJust as he completed the recording, the intercom on Germayne's desk came to life.\n\"Keezor, this is Ryde,\" came the Lieutenant's voice.\n\"I hear you. How bad is it?\"\n\"Well, it'll take some time, but it's repairable. I'm a little worried, though; it looks like the cooling system's been damaged. If it gets too hot, a lot of circuitry'll go bad, and that'll mean a longer down time.\"\n\"I see. Are you going to start repairs now?\"\n\"We already have. I'm calling from engine access area seven. Wouldn't you know, the heaviest damage is here, where some of the most important parts are?\"\n\"Is there anything I can do?\"\nRyde sighed. \"No, not really. The six of us can handle it, and we've pretty much got all we need. You might as well sit tight up there and man the radar or the radio. You never know--something might come our way.\"\n\"I'll do that,\" Keezor replied. \"Keep me updated.\"\n\"Will do. Ryde out.\"\nKeezor returned to the main section of the bridge and sat down on the floor next to Sine. \"Sine?\" he tried, \"Can you hear me? Sine?\" His friend did not reply. `At least he's not in pain, like Anton was,' Keezor reflected. `At least he's still alive.' He looked around him. For some reason, the small bridge suddenly seemed very large and very empty. A chill caressed his body with icy fingers, causing him to shudder. He thought of Marilla, warm and soft against his body the night before he left, but it only made him shiver more. He gazed down at Sine helplessly, angry that he could not do more for him. He hated idleness. He hated having nothing to do, no way to engage his mind--\nA bell clanged into life. Startled, Keezor sprang to his feet. \"Danger,\" Friend said before he could ask, \"Fire in lightspeed drive port access area seven. Engaging extinguishers.\"\n\"Ryde!\" Keezor exclaimed. He ran to the intercom. \"Ryde!\" he shouted, \"What's happening?\"\n\"We've had a cooling system failure,\" the lieutenant returned tensely but not frantically. \"We've got a chemical\/electrical fire here.\"\n\"Well get out of there!\"\n\"It's okay,\" Ryde assured him. \"It's not that bad. The automatic extinguishers should--\"\n\"Danger,\" Friend broke in, \"Extinguishing system failure in lightspeed drive port access area seven. Closing bulkheads.\"\n\"What?!\" Keezor shouted at the computer. \"No, wait--!\"\n\"Shit!\" Ryde exclaimed. A thudding noise came over the intercom as the area was sealed off. \"Oh, Lord--Friend, open the bulkhead!\"\n\"Under safety code 115, an area containing an uncontrolled fire must be sealed off until the danger is over,\" Friend replied.\n\"But,\" Keezor sputtered, \"Ryde--the others--they're still in there! Open the bulkheads!\"\n\"Under safety code 115, an area containing an uncontrolled fire must be sealed off until the danger is over.\"\n\"They'll die!\"\nNo reply.\n\"OPEN THE BULKHEADS!\"\n\"Under safety code 115, an area containing an uncontrolled fire must be sealed off until the danger is over,\" Friend droned.\n\"Keezor, do something!\" Ryde shouted. \"The fumes--the pressure in the pipes--if this gets any worse we'll have an explosion here!\"\nKeezor sprinted from the bridge and ran to the lower decks, through the engine room and toward the access areas. He came to a halt in front of area seven. He could hear Ryde and the others inside.\n\"I'm here!\" he yelled. \"I'll get you out!\"\n\"No good!\" Ryde shouted back. \"We can't open it from in here; you won't be able to open it from out there!\"\nKeezor ignored the remark and began to pound on the door controls. Nothing happened. \"Friend, open the bulkhead!\" he screamed.\n\"Under safety code 115, an area containing an uncontrolled fire must be sealed off until the danger is over,\" the computer replied.\n\"Fuck the safety code! There are personnel trapped in there! Open the bulkhead!\"\n\"Under safety code 115, an area containing an uncontrolled fire must be sealed off until the danger is over.\"\n\"Please!\"\n\"Keezor,\" came Ryde's muffled voice through the door, \"I left some tools out there. Get into the door controls and disconnect them. Maybe we can open this sucker manually.\"\nKeezor spotted the tools. Using them, he opened up the bulkhead's control panel and began to rip the wires and circuitry out with his bare hands.\n\"Hurry, Keezor!\" Ryde yelled. Keezor could hear him and the others coughing and gagging.\n\"I'm trying!\" There was a muffled pop as an explosion tore through the area behind the bulkhead. Keezor heard screaming and frantic cries for help. \"FRIEND, YOU BITCH, OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!\"\n\"Under safety code 115, an area containing an uncontrolled fire must be sealed off until the danger is over,\" she\/it replied calmly.\nKeezor began to pound on the impassable door in desperation. He could hear the others screaming, calling his name, begging him for help. He shrieked obscenities at the computer as he shouldered and hit the door over and over again.\nHe did not remember running back to the bridge. Suddenly he was there, and so were the screams, coming through loud and clear over the intercom. He covered his ears. It was not enough. He broke down, wailing, shouting at Friend as she\/it repeated the safety code for him again. He curled into a ball, shut his eyes, and screamed along with Ryde and the others. Eventually, he was the only one yelling. Soon after that, his throat became so raw he could not even do that. Sobbing convulsively, he crawled to the first aid kit, took out one of the syringes loaded with morphine, and plunged it into his arm. He collapsed, sprawled out on the floor, as darkness closed in.\n6. Two\nThe morphine kept him sluggish and oddly calm even after he stopped screaming, he fell into a heavy sleep, and woke up some hours later. He checked on Sine, then dragged himself to the Captain's office to make his report.\nCaptain's Log, supplemental entry. Lieutenant Commander Keezor reporting for the deceased Captain Germayne.\n(pause)\nFor the record, I will admit that I had knowingly and willingly drugged myself with morphine while on duty, several hours prior to this recording. I don't think I'd be able to give the report I'm about to if I hadn't.\nToday, during Lieutenant Ryde and his crew's attempts to repair the lightspeed drive, a fire started in access area seven, where they were working. When the fire control systems did not engage, Friend automatically sealed off the area, and for safety reasons would not respond to my commands to open the access area doors. All other attempts at overriding the door controls failed.\nRyde, Javis, Daq, Yoriq, Eral, and Wellow are dead. Lieutenant Commander Sine and I are the only members of the crew remaining. Sine's condition has remained unchanged.\n(pause)\nI...I had to listen to them...scream...\nOh God.\nEnd of entry.\nKeezor returned to the bridge. \"Bitch!\" he snapped. There was no reply. \"Friend!\"\n\"Yes, Lieutenant Commander Keezor?\" the computer's feminine tones replied soothingly.\n\"Damage report on the lightspeed drive.\"\nA pause, then: \"A recent fire has rendered 90% of all computer components necessary for operation inoperable.\"\n`Damn,' Keezor thought, `the safety panels must have been off during the fire, and I'm sure Ryde and the others had a hell of a lot more on their minds than putting them back on.' \"Do we carry sufficient replacement parts on board?\"\n\"Yes,\" Friend told him.\n\"Where?\"\n\"Deck two, storage room one.\"\n\"Good. I want instructions for the repair of the lightspeed drive.\"\n\"Access to the information and components you have requested are restricted to command officers, and electrical and drive mechanics engineers of specialist level three and higher. You are a command cadet of specialist level four and a strategist of specialist level six.\"\nKeezor thought for a moment. A moment was all he needed. He was, after all, only dealing with a mass of silicon and circuitry. \"Alright,\" he said patiently, \"call up the information I have requested so the proper personnel can execute the necessary repairs.\"\n\"The said personnel, or the command officers, must request the information personally,\" Friend replied. She\/it paused, then added, \"You and Lieutenant Commander Sine are the only life-forms aboard, Lieutenant Commander Keezor.\"\nKeezor drove his fist into the wall. A lance of pain streaked up his arm. He looked down at his hands. They were bruised grey from pounding on the access area door, and one of his fingers appeared to be broken. Gently holding his arms to his body, he sank into the captain's chair. \"How do you expect me to return to base if you won't let me repair the drive?\"\n\"I expect nothing, Lieutenant Commander Keezor. Access to the information and components you have requested are restricted to command officers, and electrical and drive mechanics engineers of specialist level three and higher. You are a command cadet of specialist level four and a strategist of specialist level six.\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" Keezor growled, rubbing his temples. He got up and left the bridge. `I'll do it myself,' he thought. `I'll fix the fucking drive without that bitch-thing's help. It'll take time, but I can do it.' He took a lift to the second deck. After wading through a considerable amount of debris, he eventually arrived at the door of storage room one. He pressed the \"open\" button. Nothing happened. He tried again, and again, and still nothing happened.\n\"Access to the information and components you have requested are restricted to command officers, and electrical and drive mechanics engineers of specialist level three and higher,\" Friend's voice cut in suddenly. \"You are a command cadet of specialist level four and a strategist of specialist level six.\"\n\"Shut up!\" Keezor shouted. \"Let me in, damn you!\"\n\"Access to the information and components you have requested are restricted to electrical and drive mechanics engineers of specialist level three and higher. You are a command cadet of specialist level four and a strategist of specialist level six.\"\nKeezor kicked at the door to the storage room. Desperation and fury overrode the morphine in his veins. \"STUPID MOTHERFUCKER!\" he bellowed. \"GODDAMNED ASSHOLE SHIT-EATING--\"\n\"Request not understood. Please clarify.\"\n\"BI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ITCH!\" Keezor shrieked. He threw himself against the door and sagged to the ground. \"What do you want from me?!\" he demanded angrily. \"Do you want Sine and me to die?\"\n\"I do not want anything, Lieutenant Commander Keezor.\"\n\"Fuck you,\" Keezor muttered under his breath. He got up and returned to the bridge. \"Friend,\" he said, grimacing as he spoke the name, \"Does the ship have enough power to reach the nearest Space Naval base?\"\nA pause. \"Taking current energy expenditures into consideration, negative.\"\n\"How far could the ship go?\"\n\"The Surefire can currently cover seventy-five percent of the distance to Station Twenty-One, at coordinates seven-one-seven by nine by two-five point three, on sublight power only.\"\nKeezor performed a series of quick calculations in his head. That would take the ship to the fringe of short distance radio range and long distance radar detection. \"And how long will that take?\"\n\"Calculating.\" A pause. \"Three days, eighteen hours, and forty-two minutes.\"\nKeezor stole a glance at Sine's still form. `It'll have to do,' he thought. \"Are you capable of setting and maintaining a course?\" he asked the computer.\n\"Yes, Lieutenant Commander Keezor.\"\n\"Good. Set course for Station Twenty-One.\"\n\"You are not authorized to order a course change.\"\nKeezor's expression darkened. \"I gave you an order. execute it.\"\n\"Only Captain Germayne, Commander Slaff, and Commander Tyros are authorized to order course changes which deviate from the mission.\"\nKeezor pulled at his hair. \"The mission is over!\" he shouted. \"The ship is damaged and the crew is gone! Abort the mission!\"\n\"Only Captain Germayne, Commander Slaff, Commander Tyros, or a member of Space Navy Command have the authority to abort the mission,\" Friend replied.\n\"Captain Germayne, Commander Slaff, and Commander Tyros are dead! Do you understand me?! Dead! They're not ever going to say anything again, much less order you to abort the mission!\"\n\"Only Captain Germayne--\"\n\"Shut up!\" Keezor snapped. \"Are Captain Germayne, Commander Slaff, and Commander Tyros here?\"\nThe computer paused. \"I show life-form readings only for you and for Lieutenant Commander Sine. Previously said persons are not on board.\"\n\"Not on board? They're in body bags in storage bay two, that's where they are!\"\n\"Previously said persons are not on board.\"\nKeezor stopped to think. To Friend, \"dead\" meant \"No life-form readings,\" and \"No life form readings\" meant \"Not on board.\" \"Friend,\" he went on, \"When the captain is unable to perform his duties, who takes command?\"\n\"The commander, or the designated first officer if there is more than one commander aboard the ship.\"\n\"Correct. And who takes control when the designated deputy captain cannot perform his duties?\"\n\"The next highest-ranking officer of commander level, or, if another commander is not present, the designated deputy commander.\"\n\"What is my rank?\"\n\"You are a lieutenant commander, Lieutenant Commander Keezor.\"\n\"Then, considering that Captain Germayne is not here to perform his duties, and Commanders Slaff and Tyros are not here to perform deputy captain duties, then does that not designate me, the next highest-ranking officer aboard this ship, the deputy commander in Slaff and Tyros' absences, and, since either would have been the deputy captain, but neither are here, the deputy captain?\"\nThere was a very long pause. \"You are not a designated deputy captain.\"\n\"That may be, but in Slaff and Tyros' absences, am I not the designated deputy commander?\"\n\"One moment, please,\" Friend told him, and after a short time replied, \"No such designations were made.\"\nKeezor screamed.\n\"Do you not have a default which states that in the event of a crisis situation the highest ranking officer remaining assumes command of this vessel?!\" he roared.\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\"Is this not a crisis situation?!\"\n\"Taking the damage to the ship into consideration, affirmative.\"\n\"Then as the highest ranking officer aboard this vessel, I command you to obey my instructions!\"\n\"Negative.\"\n\"NEGATIVE?! Why?!\"\n\"You are not the highest ranking officer currently aboard this vessel.\"\n\"THEN WHO THE BLOODY HELL IS?!\"\n\"Lieutenant Commander Sine outranks you by two years of service.\"\nKeezor shot a glance at his friend, lying prone on the floor. \"Sine?\" he squawked. \"Sine is in command of this ship?\"\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\"But he can't--He's in a coma, for God's sake! He's comatose! Do you understand?\"\n\"Coma:,\" Friend droned, \"a profound state of unconsciousness resulting from illness or injury.\"\n\"Correct,\" Keezor snapped. \"How can Sine command the Surefire if he's comatose?\"\n\"I have no verification of that.\"\n\"What?--No--!\" Keezor sputtered, tearing at his hair. \"I'm looking right at him, and I'm telling you, he's comatose!\"\n\"You are not authorized to make such a verification,\" the computer told him.\n\"Then who is?\"\n\"Only medical personnel are authorized to verify a crewmember's physical condition. You are a command cadet of specialist level four and a strategist of specialist level six.\"\n\"God damn you,\" Keezor growled, and went over to the navigator's station.\n\"Request not understood,\" Friend told him, \"Please clarify.\"\n\"Never mind. Is the navigational equipment still functioning?\"\n\"The navigational systems are currently operating at seventy-two percent efficiency.\"\nKeezor scanned the helm. He knew the standard operating procedures, and had watched Sine use the equipment many times before, both in school and on board the Surefire. After a moment of thought, he entered a course change.\nNothing happened. \"Only licensed navigators of specialist level five and above are permitted to use the helm of this vessel,\" Friend in him in her\/its perpetually patient voice. \"You are a command cadet of specialist level--\"\n\"STOP!\" Keezor roared. Friend cut off. He stomped across the bridge and sat down next to Sine, his eyes wild with fury. \"Sine, Sine...\" he groaned, and gazed down at his friend. \"I'm afraid... I'm afraid I'm going to have to resort to some--some desperate measures...\"\nCaptain's log, supplemental entry:\nFriend--I hate calling it that--has become bureaucratic. Since I am not a commander and since no one was ever designated \"deputy commander,\" it refuses to let me take control of the ship. Since I'm not a navigator or engineer, I am denied access to the helm and to information and equipment necessary to repair the lightspeed drive.\nThe computer told me that under the crisis default, Sine is commander of the Surefire, since he outranks me by two years of service. Since I am not a medic, it refuses to let me verify that he is comatose and unable to perform his duties. I seemed to be damned no matter what I do.\nThere is, of course, one thing left to me other than suicide or a slow death.\nI'm sure the decision I'm about to make will get me court-martialled-- just for starters.\nCaptain's log, supplemental entry:\nThe situation at hand had forced me to take somewhat drastic measures in order to preserve this ship.\nI...Without authorization I--I attempted to disconnect Friend, the Surefire's experimental computer system.\nKeezor stopped, grimaced, and squeezed his right hand tighter in an attempt to close the wide, clean gash in his upper left arm. Blood gushed out from between his fingers.\nFriend, however, was hardly keen on the idea. After being wounded by its automatic defense system, I... the situation... everything...\nThe man paused and bowed his head in shame. His gaze fell upon a large wrench sitting on the captain's desk, the steel wet with blood.\n...I destroyed Friend.\nI now have control of the Surefire. After dealing with the computer, I went to deck two, storage room one for the parts needed to repair the lightspeed drive, however few of the multitude of parts in the room were labeled, and I was unable to retrieve the necessary components for repair. So, now I have gathered all necessary supplies and equipment, and, in an attempt to conserve energy, have sealed Sine and myself in the bridge. Life support has been shut off in all other areas of the ship, and the gravity has been shut off as well. My plan is to manually navigate the ship to Station Twenty-One, almost four days away. By my calculations, the power should hold up long enough for the Surefire to get within short distance radio and long range radar range.\nEnd of Entry.\nKeezor hauled himself up and half floated, half walked back onto the main bridge. He was dizzy from blood loss; he cursed himself for not having taken care of his injury right away.\nSine was still on the floor, held down and still by strips of duct tape. The medical kit hovered over him. Keezor took the kit, settled down in the captain's chair, and strapped himself in. After his attempts to staunch the bleeding in his arm failed, he reached into the large box and withdrew a hypodermic needle pre-loaded with a local anesthetic, a small, curved needle and a length of thread. He cleaned the gash as best he could, turned his head, and pushed the syringe into his arm. After a short time the throbbing, burning pain lessened to near numbness.\nKeezor threaded the needle with some difficulty and tied a large knot at the end of the thread. He swallowed and moistened his dry lips, beginning to feel somewhat nauseous. After several false starts he managed to pierce his skin, and after what seemed like forever he had sewn up the wound, however awkwardly. The blood loss was taking its toll; his eyes were beginning to cross. The anesthetic was wearing off. Needles of pain stabbed through his arm. His whole body ached with exhaustion. Still, he forced himself to set the Surefire's course for Station Twenty-One before returning to the captain's chair and drifting off to sleep.\nWhen he woke up several hours later, Sine was dead.\n7. One\nHe felt very strange--or was it that he did not feel at all? Somehow there was no longer fear, no anger, no reaction to his situation, not like there had been in the first frantic moments after the hull breech, when Anton was screaming and the alarms were shrieking and confusion and terror had him shaking in his boots. Not like when Ryde and the others had burned to death and he had had to listen to it. Not like the agony of waking up to find his friend lifeless, and realizing in afterthought that if he had not lost his temper Friend--the object of years of research, now ruined--would now recognize him and not Sine as the commander of the Surefire.\n`Oh, yes,' he would think, `you don't need anybody and you can do everything yourself and you can beat anything at anything and you just love to be alone don't you alone and quiet and thinking oh yeah you just love it don't you hell yes I do I love being alone with myself but not on a half-dead ship full of fucking corpses!'\nHe drifted into a sort of dazed stupor, not asleep, but not awake. He would occasionally spasm as a terrible vision of things past would burst into his mind, clear and crisp as the moment he had originally experienced them. He stirred only to get up, moving like a zombie, and correct the ship's course heading when a small light on the helm flashed a warning. He did not eat, speak, or tend to his arm.\nThree and a half days passed. He was staring at nothing when out of the corner of his eye he saw the hailing light on the communication panel flash. He stood up on shaky legs and answered the call.\n\"This,\" he began. His voice was hoarse and cracked. He cleared his throat. \"This is Lieutenant Commander Keezor of the Surefire.\"\n\"Surefire, this is Captain Oran, administrator of Station Twenty-One. We've received your priority distress signal. What is your condition?\"\n\"We've had five hull breaches,\" Keezor replied dully. \"I'm the only one left out of a crew of fifty-one.\"\n\"Good God.\" There was a pause. \"The High Command contacted us, you know. They got worried--they lost contact with their new ship and didn't know what the hell was going on. It's a good thing we found you. How bad is the ship? Can you navigate her in?\"\n\"No, sir,\" Keezor told him quietly.\n\"Alright, don't worry. I've already sent out a couple of cruisers; they'll tow you in.\"\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\nSeveral hours later the Surefire docked at Station Twenty-One. Keezor went to the main airlock, straightening his posture as it opened. A man he presumed to be Captain Oran ran up the boarding ramp to him, several medics in tow.\n\"Incredible,\" Oran exclaimed as he approached. He stopped in front of Keezor. \"Shit, you're just a kid! You're a lieutenant commander?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Keezor affirmed without much emotion.\n\"How old are you?\"\n\"Twenty-five, sir.\"\n\"Incredible,\" Oran repeated. \"And you got the ship all the way back here by yourself. How did you do it? What the hell happened, anyway?\"\nKeezor stared at the older man for some moments. He closed his eyes, then opened them slowly. \"With all due respect, sir,\" he said in a low voice, \"it's all in the log.\"\nOran seemed mildly disappointed. \"I understand.\" He looked Keezor over. \"Are you alright?\"\n\"Fine, sir,\" Keezor replied.\nOran nodded. \"Come on, then; I'll escort you to your quarters. I'm sure you could use a rest.\"\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\nThe captain turned and started down the boarding ramp.\nBehind him, Keezor collapsed in a heap.\nHe spent the next week at Station One, being treated for exhaustion and damage to his arm. When the doctors deemed him well enough to go, he was put on a shuttle and sent home.\nBy this time the Surefire's logs had reached the High Command, so it came as no surprise to him when he was summoned for a meeting with the top brass.\nAn Admiral named Slane questioned him thoroughly but respectfully. He was then brought before a committee including Slane and many other high-ranking officers and officials.\n\"Under the circumstances, we have chosen to ignore your actions against Friend,\" Slane told him. \"You will not be charged or held accountable in that matter. We have also decided to overlook your admission of performing your duties under the influence of a narcotic.\n\"It is our opinion that you behaved in the most appropriate and noble manner possible under the circumstances. You have displayed exceptional bravery as well as a number of outstanding traits, for which you will be presented with the Medal of Honor at a ceremony scheduled for next week.\n\"As for your effort to command, to aid your fellow crewmembers, and to save your ship, we wish to reward you with a choice.\"\n\"A choice, sir?\" Keezor inquired.\n\"You may, if you wish, take a promotion to the rank of Commander, and captain the scout ship Nebula,\" Slane informed him. \"However, it seems the Division of Tactical Research has taken a keen interest in you, and has offered you the opportunity to train as a junior tactician. The program requires several years of studies before certification, and will also require you to remain earthbound for up to two years after that. The program is quite rigorous, and, under certain circumstances, may result in a desk job, so I'm sure you'll want to think about it care--\"\n\"I'll take it.\"\nFaye Levine is an Art\/Design Freshman at Carnegie Mellon Unversity.

Palmer Hall as a personal voyage of discovery, but had wound up as Copyright (c)1992 a decades-long period of entrapment...\"\nWhen she heard the front door of the Miners' Inn open, Cora Dalmire looked up from her work. A middle-aged man had stopped in front of the dreary oil painting that occupied most of one wall of the entryway\nHe looked at the swirls of black and the pinprick glares of white intently as if searching for some reason he should have encountered it. The look on his face and his hands tracing the swirls told Cora the painting had disturbed him as it had most out-Vesta visitors to the asteroid. She had studied each of their reactions as closely as she studied his and had never quite seen what she was looking for.\nCora and her husband, Garcin Dalmire, had brought the painting with them to Vesta thirty years earlier when they had still hoped to find excitement and to strike it rich mining the asteroids. Running out of credits and with no funds to leave Vesta, Garcin had signed on with the Vesta Mining Company. Twenty-one years later, a drunken miner had set a short fuse and a collapsing tunnel buried Garcin beneath tons of ore.\nWith the last of her insurance money, Cora had purchased the inn, and, in her first act as owner, had hung the painting by the entrance. It reminded her of Earth and of the emotional impetus that had forced her into what both she and Garcin had dreamed of as a personal voyage of discovery, but had wound up as a decadeslong period of entrapment on a small planetoid with nothing to offer except the possibility of one day earning enough credits to return to Earth.\nFinally, the stranger turned his face from the painting and walked slowly to her desk. \"That's a hell of a painting you got there, lady.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said, not even bothering to smile. \"Are you staying long?\"\n\"Only the one night. By then, my ship should have cleared Vesta Security and I'll be able to set up shop.\"\n\"What are you selling?\" Cora pulled her scanner to the front of the desk and reached for his credicard. She scanned it quickly and, as the display lit up, added his name. \"Mr. Bunskin, is it?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am, Ray Bunskin. And I'm not selling anything. I landed in the Alcuin, a libship. I lend, for a small fee, datawhirls, tri-dees, and a very small stock of the world's great books. Nothing but the finest.\" Sensing that he had a customer, Ray smiled. \"If you can come down in the morning, the library bay in the ship'll be opening early.\"\n\"You have books?\" For the first time in a year, a slight smile played across Cora's normally dour face.\n\"Yes, but only a few. Nothing but the classics. Most of my customers just want the latest datawhirls. It doesn't pay to stock books. They want to experience the emotions of the characters in various situations, have the datawhirler spin out different scenarios based on their own ideas. You know what I mean? Not just follow a plot that someone else devised.\"\n\"When I was a young girl, Mr. Bunskin, I haunted our local library. Read book after book after book. How lovely! The smell and the feel of books! Oh, it has been a long, long time.\"\nRay Bunskin stared at the innkeeper. She wasn't young anymore, in her fifties, but still attractive when she smiled. Must be bored, too, he thought, to talk about books like that, when he had so many datawhirls and tri-dees. \"You come on down to the Alcuin, Ms....?\"\n\"Cora Dalmire, Mr. Bunskin. And I'll definitely make it down to your ship when you're ready.\"\nThe next morning, after serving breakfast to the unmarried miners who stayed in the Inn, Cora Dalmire walked out under the clear dome and, for the first time in more than a year, noticed the brightness of the strange sky. Though she had lived on Vesta for more than two decades, she continued to recall the night stars from Earth. This year on Vesta, the night sky with its familiar constellations, was marred by the return of the comet. Such predictability isn't right in such an unpredictable universe, she thought. Falling in towards the sun, Halley's tail had already begun to streak behind it as it raced inside Jupiter's orbit and began its plunge through the belt. She shuddered slightly as she stared at the growing tail and thought of its long voyages century after century, then she turned back towards the library.\nCora had grown used to the reduced gravity of Vesta and loped in long, almost slow-motion, strides through the streets of the small town and over the too-close horizon to the seldom-used spaceport.\nThe Alcuin, one of two ships in dock at the time, was garish in the extreme. As she walked up to the two synthalloy lions flanking the entrance to the library, Cora laughed out loud. They recalled memories of her Earthtown library, but these lions were distorted. Their over-sized eyes glowed red and sensors, detecting Cora, caused the eyes to swivel towards her and show scenes from the latest tri-dees. From the speakers in their mouths, the lions roared out the costs of datawhirls and players and invited her in.\nAs she walked between the lions and into the ship's main library, Cora spotted Ray Bunskin napping behind the main desk. She walked quickly through the glare of tri-dee screens and past shelf after shelf of datawhirls to the very back of the shop where she had spotted a small collection of only a few hundred books.\n\"Beg pardon, Ms. Dalmire,\" Bunskin yawned widely and stretched, \"didn't see you come in. Just taking a little rest. Setting up the entrance and the lions wore me out.\"\nHis eyes lit up as he saw her pull one of the books from its shelf. He could smell a rental. \"As I said last night, we don't get much call for book books, but we do have that small set you're looking at. There simply aren't enough real book readers in the system any more.\"\n\"Is this all? For a library?\" A slight frown appeared on Cora's face.\n\"Yes, ma'am. I've got a great collection of datawhirls, though, if you'd like to really lose yourself in a strong plot that you help to create.\"\n\"I don't think so, Mr. Bunskin. I don't want to lose myself, not again.\" She turned back to the books and pulled down from the shelf a fat copy of Moby Dick. \"It's been years since I've seen this book. Will you be on Vesta long? Will I have time to read it?\"\n\"It's hard to tell, Ms. Dalmire. From the looks of things,\" he waved around the empty room, \"I'm not going to make my nut any time soon. I could be stuck here forever.\"\n\"Then I'll take it,\" she said, handing him her credicard.\n\"Here,\" he said, \"take this one, too, no charge. Just for taking that old book off the shelves.\" He handed her an unlabeled datawhirl.\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\"Old French stuff, mid-twentieth century, but the label's worn off. Only thing you can read is `existentialisme'. Plug it in while you're reading the book and it'll double your pleasure.\"\nTo the sound of roaring lions, Cora left the library and retreated to her small room behind the Inn's desk. With two hours before she needed to prepare dinner for the dozen miners who stopped by on the way to their cubicles, she had time to make a start on the story. She put the datawhirl on the small table next to her chair and opened the book to the first page. \"Call me Ishmael!\" she read, and lost herself in the story.\nAfter what seemed to Cora only a few minutes, a yell from the front of the Inn interrupted her quiet. \"What's for dinner, Cora? Where the hell are you?\"\n\"Clam chowder,\" she screamed back, then realized where she was. \"I mean, whatever it is will be ready in a minute. Go on into the dining room!\" She put the book down next to the datawhirl and stretched her whole body as she reimmersed herself in the daily routine of running the Miners' Inn.\nServing dinner to the miners, she thought back to Earth and whales and oceans and wondered why she had ever left. \"Aaah!\" she screamed, Karl Johnsen, one of the younger miners, grabbed her around the waist and pulled her onto his lap. She slapped him hard on the face and ran out of the room tears streaming down her face.\n\"Cora! What's wrong?\" Karl yelled after her and ran back to the office. \"Cora, honey, I didn't mean anything by it. Just a little fun. Can't do much of anything else on this rock.\"\n\"There's a library, Karl. Go check out a book or something and stop treating me like a piece of natural beef.\"\n\"Hey, Cora. I'm real sorry, honey.\"\n\"Don't you \"honey\" me, Karl Johnsen. If I had the money, I'd get off this scurvy rock and back to Earth where men like you can find these to do without bothering me.\"\n\"Earth? You talking about the Earth I came from last year, Cora? There's nothing there for anyone except chemshooters and socketheads. It's not like out here, honey, where you're free to do whatever you can afford to do.\" Karl smiled at her and drew her into his arms. As she looked up, he bent his head down and brought his lips down hard on hers.\nCora pushed back and kicked him hard in the groin. \"Keep the hell away from me!\" She ran into the dining room. \"All of you just keep away from me!\"\nThat night, after the last miner had either gone to bed or down the street to the bar, she lay down in her own bed and picked up the book to read again. She looked down at the datawhirl which she had brought up the stairs with her, and with a shrug, pushed it into the slot next to the lamp socket. She opened the book to Father Mapple's sermon and, enjoying the company of Ishmael and Queequeg, began to read of various whaling disasters.\nBut what was Garcin doing in the old clapboard church? And who was Estelle? Why couldn't they open the door? And where did the door lead? She realized that the datawhirl had put her and her lost husband into the church with Ishmael, but could not figure out the attractive blonde woman named Estelle who clung to her husband's arm or the big bronze clock sitting on the pew in front of her. She put the book down and unplugged the datawhirl.\nFinding her place again, she read until late in the night. When she fell asleep, the book dropping to the floor beside her, Cora dreamed. In her dream, she sailed a spaceship called Pequod II chasing throughout the system a great phantasm with a huge tail streaming behind it. She whispered into the night that nothing would box her in, not ever again. She strove with the malignant beast and woke, sweat-soaked, with fire in her eyes, shouting, \"I'd strike the sun if it insulted me!\"\nStill shaking with rage, Cora pulled her faded clothing back over her body and brushed her hair in front of the mirror. As she twisted her long black hair out of her face, she saw the wild look in her own eyes and, faintly behind her, the shape of a man holding a gold doubloon in his hand. And she knew, suddenly, who Estelle was.\nShe remembered walking home to the small dome she and Garcin shared and seeing the young blonde woman racing out of the house. When she had asked Garcin about her, he had shrugged off the incident. \"Nothing to worry about,\" he had said. \"Just a woman from the shop. Not a brain in her head.\" She had only been the first, and perhaps not even that, the first Cora has caught. In the years before Garcin's death, Cora knew of three other women he had bedded in their dome. She had been ready to leave, but had no other place to go.\nImages of whales and the bronze clock and of Estelle and Garcin and a locked room stayed in her mind all day. That night she dreamed again of the Pequod II and saw her husband, his hands in Estelle's long blond hair, and herself locked in the small room. Garcin glanced quickly at Cora, stroked Estelle's face and then pounded against the door, banging harder and harder, until finally it cracked open and swung out. He stood at the threshold and stared out into the dark corridor. Taking Estelle's hand and turning his back to Cora, he shook his head sadly.\nWatching the two of them move back into the room and sit down on a hideously green sofa, Cora walked to the door, then turned back and looked once more at Garcin. \"Aren't you coming?\" she asked. When he replied that he had too much still to learn about himself in the locked room, she laughed bitterly, and walked through the prison door into a blackness devoid of light. She looked back into the bright room, then slammed the door shut behind her.\nWhen Cora awoke the next morning, she felt relaxed and more alive than she had felt in years. Plugging in the datawhirl, she opened the pages of the book to read the last chapters and learn of the death of Captain Ahab. The datawhirl no longer fed her the story of Estelle and Garcin; the clock was gone. But Ahab raged and speared the whale and the Pequod sank. When Queequeg's coffin shot to the top of the ocean, she sighed and put the book away.\nCora made her mind up that morning to leave Vesta. The datawhirl had reminded of her of her husband's infidelities and of the stagnancy that had pervaded her life. She would do something and in that doing would rise out of the locked box. And she would begin with Bunskin.\nThe first thing she saw when she left the Inn that morning was Comet Halley, its tail already stretching across the horizon as the solar winds pushed them farther and farther behind the small nucleus. She raised her hands as if to strangle the chunk of dirty ice. \"Nothing should be so predictable!\" she screamed at it.\nRay Bunskin never had a chance. He stood to greet her when he heard the lions roaring. Asking her if she wanted to rent anything else, he was stunned at her reply.\n\"I want the ship! Now!\" As she spoke her eyes pinned him to the wall.\n\"But you can't have it! It's my livelihood.\"\n\"Livelihood hell!\" She almost spat the words at him. \"What kind of living can a man make doing what you do. With me as your only customer on Vesta, you'll never earn enough money to take the old tub off asteroid. You might as well sell it now instead of waiting `til you can't even afford a meal at the Inn.\"\n\"Sell it? The Alcuin? How could you afford to buy a ship like this? The automated navaids alone would cost more than a dead miner's wife could ever hope to pay. No, Ms. Dalmire, I'd love to sell out from under this thing, but you couldn't float the credits.\"\nCora looked at him sharply. \"I can afford the ship. Not with credits, but with the Inn. It's yours Bunskin and all its contents and damnable customers, for the ship.\"\nBunskin saw the way her eyes lipped over the datawhirls and her hands clasped the book and thought he could get more out of her. \"Okay, Ms. Dalmire, she's yours for the Inn and for whatever credits you have in your account.\"\n\"Half the credits or no deal,\" Cora said. \"I've got to get the powerpacks refilled. But take all the datawhirls with you this afternoon.\"\nShe plugged her credicard into the scanner and told it to transfer half her credits and the rights to the Miners' Inn on Vesta to Ray Bunskin as soon as he transferred the Alcuin to her. Bunskin then inserted his credicard.\n\"You've got yourself a ship, Ms. Dalmire.\"\n\"Enjoy the inn, Mr. Bunskin. I'm going home to Earth.\"\n\"But that's the one place you can't go, Ms. Dalmire. You can go any other place in the system, but not to Earth.\"\n\"Why not?\" She turned to him, knowing when she saw him shift his eyes that he was telling the truth. \"Why not, Bunskin?\"\n\"The same reason I didn't go there. Only drones can land near Earth. The poisons in the atmosphere got so bad over the past few decades that no one's allowed in, only out. Only reason people can leave is the authorities figure that way there'd be more of everything for the people left.\"\nCora ran back to the inn, leaping madly, recklessly through the small town. When she got back to the room, she through her clothes into a small bag and lurched back outside, stopping only to take down the oil painting that was her last link to the dying planet.\nThe next morning, she cleared port authority and floated gently away from Vesta. Selecting a navigation chip, she set the time, date, and Vesta coordinates on the console and told the ship to plot a course for Comet Halley. Pequod II flashed an enlarged view of Jupiter on the six foot screen above the console.\n\"Not Jupiter, idiot! The comet! Take us to the comet!\"\nIn rhythmic speech, the computer responded. \"This ship is incapable of reaching Comet Halley without taking advantage of the gravity well of Planet Jupiter. The only possible window lies in Jupiter. Pequod II will intersect Halley orbit between Planet Earth and Planet Venus.\"\nFor the next few weeks, Cora worked her way through Ray Bunskin's book collection, stopping only to exercise, eat and drink and to stare at Jupiter as it occupied a greater and greater part of the display.\n\"Have you ever read Moby Dick, computer?\"\n\"This computer has scanned most books and has links to all major datalibraries. It does not read, but can display the contents of any scanned book.\"\nAfter a few months, the ship dove through the rings of Jupiter and Cora sank deeply into her acceleration couch as the forces slingshotting Pequod towards Earth pressed against her. By that time, she had grown bored. Of the ship and the food! Of the books and the computer. Of the low vibrations of the ship's engine. It's time, she thought. Time to fight back. Time to thrust my hand through the wall and shout like Ahab against the walls that hold me in. Her head ached and throbbed in time with the pulsing of the ship.\nA new picture had appeared on the console. The picture framed in a black background a myriad of white specks swirling across the sky. Halley's Comet, its head tiny compared to the long tail streaming away from the sun, had made its long journey through the outer planets on its circuit into the system and streaked in to brush near the sun. She felt the ship shudder as the main engine boosted speed with the assistance of Jupiter's gravity and sped on its way to its rendezvous. Cora sat back down to finish her book.\nShe had forced herself to exercise during her three-month flight to reach the comet. Her hair grew ever longer and her muscles toned up as the regimen matched the rhythm of the pounding in her head. Ever in front of her, she could see the comet. It blended with the painting in the Miners' Inn, swirled through the blackness of the canvas. Her eyes flashed wildly at the screen as the comet's head grew larger and larger until, at length, the tail could fill only half the display and the head, only eight kilometers wide, grew larger than a human's.\nShe laughed wildly as she slammed her body through the routine that had begun with a half hour each morning and night and now occupied half her waking hours. She needed less sleep than she had earlier required and ate ravenously to feed the demands of her growing muscles. Cora prepared herself for the great task to come.\nFinally, the ship's alarms clanged and she heard the first evidence that she was closing with the comet as tiny fragments of the tail intercepted Pequod II's path.\nCora ordered the ship to give full front display and blanched as she saw, then heard, more fragments banging into the front deflector screens. The plasma display unit came alive with the tiny pinpricks of light racing toward the ship in bright lines as she matched patterns with the streaking ball of ice and flew into the tail.\nHer fingers flashing across the keyboard, Cora ordered the Pequod II back into the flume as comet and ship plunged down toward the inner planets and the sun. At 18,000 kilometers out she saw the black nucleus in the center of the bright spray of gasses. A fist of ice and encrusted dust, the comet's head dominated the screen like some malevolent despot demanding her retreat, and Cora screamed in defiance.\nChoosing the heaviest trail of light she could find, Cora made last minute adjustments to the console and nursed the ship to greater and greater speed. As she saw the black fist grow larger and larger, filling the screen, she ordered the computer to cut the engines. The Pequod II raced down the shining yellow tunnel made by the comet's tail and plunged downward into the spray. Cora raised her own fist back at the comet and sang in outrage as the ship plunged into the abyss and fractured the ball of ice in an explosion that sent showers of multicolored lights racing through the system for days.\nA large chunk of its nucleus broke off and Comet Halley, calving, created a daughter comet. Twin tails licked outward from the comets as they grew farther and farther apart. The night sky over Vesta lit up with the reflection from Cora's comet as it began its journey past Earth and around the sun.\nPalmer Hall is Library Director at St. Mary's University and teaches part-time in the English Department.

She shut them off immediately, for they served no purpose on this particular day; the sun, though barely above the horizon, had no clouds to block it.\nBilly's mood was not so bright. Summer vacation had just come to an end, and the interminable, probably endless days of school were about to begin again. Already his reluctance to submit to this fate had resulted in missing the school bus, and a near-successful attempt to hide his continued presence from his mother made him even later.\nHis mother's own outlook was, therefore, less than perfect. She didn't say a word to him as they slipped down the avenue away from their home, selected a few choice phrases for the next couple of blocks, then relapsed into the impenetrable silence as they covered the remaining three miles to the school's street.\nBilly could see the three-story school building ahead, and sank deeper into his gloom. The doors were closed, he would be late. To have a pink slip on the very first day of second grade, in addition to the suffering of mere attendance, seemed more than he should be expected to survive.\nWith a passion he'd never felt before, he wished the school would disappear. In his head he could picture the street as it would appear without the school, the building gone entirely. It was a lovely dream, a Nirvana in which this particular hell no longer existed. He sharpened the mental image of the absent building, seeing only the shading trees and empty avenue. Billy lost himself in his sudden dream.\nAnd a moment later that dream came true.\nBilly and his mother had just enough time to realize that there was something wrong before the howling began; followed by a thunderous crash and a jerk that tore away all consciousness.\nMartin Kendall's feet sat on an oak desk in a cave in the Colorado rockies. A coin fell through the air in front of him, vanished inches above the desk, and reappeared near the ceiling. A moment later, as it again neared the desk, the stunt repeated itself. Kendall had been doing this for nearly half an hour, just barely able to control the coin at terminal velocity.\nAn intercom buzzed, and he dropped his feet to the floor with sudden alertness. The coin, suddenly ignored, buried itself in his desktop.\n\"Martin?\" The voice of his secretary was badly distorted by the cheap intercom. \"Sorry to bother you, but Henry brought me this a few minutes ago, and I thought you should see it.\" A manila folder materialized on the desk. Kendall opened it at once.\nIt was a handwritten note, labeled \"Transcription from Police Channel, St. Williams, Iowa\".\n\"Jefferson Park School appears to have vanished. No trace of the building remains above ground level, and there is not enough debris present to hypothesize an ordinary explosion of any kind. Several nearby objects appeared to be picked up and tossed TOWARD the scene of the disappearance, including several cars, whose occupants are currently being taken to Central Hospital for treatment. I will require backup and several ambulances.\"\nBeneath it was scrawled hastily, \"This looks like one of ours.\"\nKendall had his hand back on the intercom before he finished reading. \"Get me four or five Teletrix and have them meet me at the school as fast as you can get them there. Is Henry still out there?\"\nHis question was answered a second later when the specified party appeared in front of his desk. About fifty, Henry was still in perfect shape, with slightly silvered hair which seemed to argue with his blue jeans and tennis shoes. His face almost always wore a slight smile, but today it showed no trace of humor. His eyebrows rose in a silent question, his body almost quivering with repressed motion.\nKendall nodded, and the world changed. Without sound or transition, the rock walls of the Colorado cave were replaced by blue sky and defoliated trees. The chair on which he had been sitting a moment before vanished. Only the fact that he had begun to stand saved him from collapsing to the ground.\nHenry was standing next to him, glancing around to be sure no one had observed the teleportation. Satisfied, he gestured toward a large, regularly shaped pit in front of them. Policemen were scattered around it, with the disoriented, suspicious wandering of people facing the completely unknown.\n\"That's the basement of the school building. The leaves and branches all around it are from the trees here. They were apparently sucked into the vacuum left when the school disappeared.\"\nKendall nodded silently. \"You're right --- it does look like a Shifter, or a Teletrix who wants us to think so. Let's see if we can get in there without the police harassing us.\"\n\"No problem.\" Henry held out a small wallet. Kendall opened it, saw a badge and a card which read, in part, 'George MacWills, Federal Bureau of Investigation.' He smiled.\nThe policeman who stopped them let them pass after seeing the badge. Henry dropped carefully into the pit and helped Kendall down.\nThe place was a disaster. Folding chairs, old desks, and pieces of brick wall had been picked up, smashed, and indiscriminately tossed about by the winds.\n\"Quite a mess,\" Kendall commented. \"Not likely there's going to be anything here to give us clues. What time was it here when this happened?\"\n\"About eight thirty.\"\nKendall froze, turned around slowly. \"So school was in session?\"\nHenry nodded slowly.\n\"Oh shit.\"\n\"The parents will start arriving once the word gets out, and there will be enough media attention to keep people talking for ages. There were almost fifteen hundred students there, plus the teachers and...\" his voice trailed off suddenly.\nKendall followed his gaze, saw nothing at first, then a few droplets of crimson showed a macabre path to something Kendall didn't want to look at at all.\nBut he did. It was the lower half of a body, eviscerated and scattered about the floor, discreetly covered with leaves, almost invisible.\n\"He must have been walking down the stairs when the school was teleported. Half of him left here, the other half went... wherever the rest of the school went.\" Henry's voice quivered audibly, though he kept it just above a whisper.\nKendall shivered a bit himself. \"This can't be seen from above. Let's get rid of it before the cops find it. They've had enough inexplicable things for one day.\" He teleported the body to a remote desert and brought back an equal volume of air to take its place. Only a slight shifting of the leaves showed that anything had happened.\n\"We're wasting time,\" Kendall continued. \"Get in contact with as many of the Teletrix as you can find all over the world; use my files to look them up. We need to find out where that school was sent. It would have made quite a flash when it appeared; I'll see if any military satellites picked it up. While I'm at it I'll get the army to control this. That should effectively silence the media.\"\n\"We have people that high in the military?\" Henry sounded surprised.\n\"We have people everywhere,\" Kendall said without emotion. \"Wait here for the help I asked for to arrive, and get them to help you look. There's a couple thousand very confused people somewhere right now, most of them schoolchildren. We need to find out where they went.\"\nHenry nodded. \"I'll meet you at the Academy in an hour, whether I have news or not.\"\nKendall finished climbing out of the basement, headed for a small outbuilding, stepped behind it and vanished.\nTwo hours later three people gathered in Kendall's office. The third was a young woman of about twenty-five, an accomplished Teletrix and major instructor at the Academy.\n\"The army is currently guarding the school,\" Kendall commented. \"And there's not going to be any mention in the media. But this is going to be hard to gloss over.\n\"Worse, the school still hasn't been located. None of the weather or military satellites registered a flash that hasn't been otherwise explained. And the students and teachers haven't phoned.\"\n\"Sounds bad,\" Emily Westlane said. \"We have to assume they're dead. The odds appear that they weren't teleported anywhere on Earth, and even if they were the school building would probably have collapsed in it's new setting.\"\nHenry nodded. \"An extra-terrestrial destination seems likely. But who would want to send a school into outer space?\"\nEmily shrugged. \"A student who didn't want to attend classes. We know that this was an amateur teleportation, possibly even a first manifestation of power. A child seems likely.\" She paused. \"If it was their first time, it's unlikely that they would have known enough to take themselves along.\"\n\"So someone outside the school building, probably a student who didn't want to go to school, or a staff member that didn't want to go to work.\" Henry considered. \"It was after school normally started, so there would be a relatively small number of people not in attendance. But I don't know how we could check every child and teacher in St. Williams.\"\nThe group became silent for a few moments. Then Kendall snapped his fingers.\n\"We don't have to. Just check the hospitals and morgue.\"\n\"Huh?\" Henry looked confused.\nKendall smiled briefly. \"This teleportation was amateur; the vacuum almost assures that. Only a tiny portion of them learn to use a grid for energy before we find them.\"\nHenry's befuddled expression vanished. \"So our Shifter must have been using his own energy.\"\n\"That school had a huge volume; quite an effort for an amateur. The strain must have been enormous.\" Emily sighed. \"The morgue seems more likely.\"\n\"Check it,\" Kendall said. \"Henry, you check the hospitals.\"\n\"There's only one,\" Henry said. \"I'll be back in ten minutes. \" He vanished.\n\"Me, too,\" Emily said, and Kendall was suddenly alone.\nThree people who were not doctors exited a broom closet of the St. Martin city hospital wearing doctors' gowns. Henry had checked this hall only moments before, determined it to be relatively unused; no one was around to wonder what important medical conference had been held in the closet.\nHenry set off at a brisk pace, Kendall and Emily at his heels.\n\"His name is William Goldwin, or 'Billy.' He's eight years old, starting second grade. He was late to school; his mother was driving him in. She says she saw the school simply vanish, felt a strong wind and heard thunder, then the car was lifted and thrown and she woke up in the hospital.\" Henry paused for breath. \"She was treated for minor bruises and released, but Billy is in a coma. They're in there.\" He pointed to a door.\nKendall glanced at his watch. \"My wife should be getting home right about now. Go get her, and tell her to bring her kit.\"\nHenry nodded once, briefly, and then was not there. Kendall pushed open the door and stepped into the room. Emily followed.\nBilly lay on a bed, various pieces of machinery attached to his face and chest. On the other side of the room a crying woman sat in a plush chair. A doctor stood over the bed, fiddling with one of the dials and consulting a clipboard. He looked up as Kendall and Emily entered.\nThe doctor looked up as they entered. \"You're not doctors,\" he said simply.\nEmily smiled broadly, but not without a hint of malice. \"We need to talk, outside.\"\nThe doctor looked uncertain, glancing between her and the door. Kendall casually placed himself in the line of retreat.\n\"I don't know who you are, but this patient needs my attention now, and I don't have time for you. You'll have to wait outside.\"\nKendall gave Emily a sideways glance and shrugged. She pulled a wallet from a coat pocket, flipped it open toward the doctor. \"You don't understand. I'm agent Smith of the FBI, and we need to talk outside right now.\"\nThe doctor's agitation increased considerably, but he held his ground. \"No, you don't understand. I can't leave him right now.\"\nEmily snapped the wallet closed and put it back in her pocket. \"I think we're failing to communicate.\" She turned toward Billy's mother, who had looked up during the exchange. \"Mrs. Goldwin, if you'll excuse us?\"\nAn instant later Emily and the doctor were gone.\nMrs. Goldwin flew to her feet like she'd been stung. Kendall held up his hand in a restraining gesture, and smiled.\n\"Don't worry, ma'am. We're not really with the FBI, but we can help your son, I hope.\"\n\"How did they just disappear?\" She was still standing, every muscle tensed as though she were about to run.\n\"I'll explain everything once we've gotten your son revived. Has he been thrashing around, like he's been having nightmares? Sweating?\"\n\"No.\" She looked as though it took considerable effort to get the word out.\nKendall frowned. The energy drain usually caused terrible nightmares, except in the most extreme cases when the body was too deeply drained. He had never seen an extreme case survive.\n\"Mrs. Goldwin,\" he said slowly, \"I need to ask you a couple questions, and the answers are extremely important. Your son has a very special ability, one that only a few people possess. He can make things move using only his mind. That's what happened to the school; he apparently sent it somewhere else.\"\n\"Billy would never do that!\"\n\"He almost certainly did it by accident. Most people do, their first time. He was probably wishing the school would go away, and 'poof', it did. But it's very important to know where he sent it. Did he say anything just before the accident that might give us a clue?\"\nShe considered. \"No. He wasn't speaking at all. We'd had an argument about his going to school.\"\nKendall grimaced inwardly.\nThere was a slight movement behind him, and Mrs. Goldwin started.\n\"You rang?\" June Kendall had a smile on her face. She lost it almost as soon as she realized her surroundings. She joined her husband at the bed, looked down into the boy's face. Carefully, she set her briefcase on the edge of the bed and opened it. Henry, who had teleported the two of them here, silently took a chair.\n\"Wake him up,\" Kendall said.\nJune frowned. \"The only thing that might wake him is...\" She trailed off, looked across the bed at Mrs. Goldwin. \"You the boy's mother?\"\n\"Yes, I am.\" She looked very pale.\nBehind the cover of her open briefcase, June pressed a vial into Kendall's hand. \"About half,\" she said aloud.\nKendall teleported about half the vial's contents into Mrs. Goldwin's lungs and chest, then teleported himself across the bed to catch her as she slumped. Carefully, he dragged her to the chair.\n\"That will keep her out for about twenty minutes. We'll tell her she fainted. She certainly looked bad enough.\"\nKendall nodded. \"Can you wake him up?\"\n\"Not safely. There's some stuff here that might work, but it's damn potent. It might wake him, on the other hand it might cause massive heart failure, too.\"\nKendall considered. \"He's dead for sure if we don't wake him. But we'll need the doctor just in case. I hope Emily's done intimidating him. Henry, will you go get them? I suspect they're on the roof.\"\nJune shuddered. \"Don't you folks have any less drastic intimidation techniques? Have you ever tried just talking to resolve your differences? Or maybe something just a trifle more subtle?\"\nHenry grinned slightly. \"Subtlety isn't exactly the point we're trying to make. I'll go get them.\"\nHe vanished.\nMidnight\nA sharp slap brought Billy back to awareness. He could only barely get his eyes open, but he spread his lids carefully and tried to focus on his surroundings through the resulting haze.\nKendall sat on the edge of the bed with an intent look on his face. Behind him, beyond the range on which Billy could focus stood the doctor, Henry, Emily, and June. Billy's mother still dozed in her chair on the other side of the bed.\n\"Billy, can you hear me?\" Kendall's voice was very low, almost a whisper. June prodded him in the back and he repeated the question a bit more loudly.\n\"Yes.\" It took several attempts to get the word out. Billy remembered a time he had almost drowned, the foggy feeling that would not go away. He felt like that now.\n\"Do you know what a grid is?\"\nBilly's brain refused to yield a definition. He shook his head slowly.\nKendall unfolded a large piece of paper, held it close to him. It was glossy black, with yellow lines at about three inch intervals forming squares.\n\"Can you close your eyes and imagine this?\"\nBilly tried, and sleep overcame him almost at once. Another slap brought him back.\n\"Billy, it's very important that you stay awake. Try to imagine this picture in your mind. Keep your eyes open.\"\nBilly studied the grid intently for a few moments, formed an image of it in his mind. \"Ok\"\n\"Good. Now pretend that those yellow lines are all over the room, connecting everything with each other. Try to imagine a whole bunch of yellow lines.\"\nBilly nodded. Kendall smiled slightly, pulled a coin from his pocket.\n\"Now here's the hard part. Look at this coin, and pretend that there's a yellow line connecting it with the blanket right here.\" Kendall patted the bed slightly. \"Okay?\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Now, imagine the coin moving along the yellow line to the bed.\"\nThere was a soft pop, and simultaneously a flash of brilliant light from the bed. The coin now sat on the blanket.\nBilly's fatigue vanished, energy flowing through his body as though some internal dam had burst.\nKendall stood up, the coin vanishing as he did so. \"Good, he'll be okay now. He's tapped the grid enough to get his energy back. Doctor, I don't think we'll be needing your services any more. June, see if you can wake his mother.\"\nThe doctor fled the room. Emily watched him go with a slight grin. June gently shook Billy's mother, awakening her easily.\n\"We all need to have a talk,\" Kendall said. \"And this isn't the place to have it. I'm going to take us all to my office. Mrs. Goldwin, Billy, this may make you slightly uncomfortable. Everything around you is going to change suddenly, but you won't be hurt in any way. Are you ready?\"\nMrs. Goldwin's eyes clearly said no, but she softly said, \"Yeah.\"\nKendall smiled, nodded curtly, and the whole world changed.\nSafely seated a half mile below the surface of a Colorado mountain, Kendall turned at once to business.\n\"Billy, when you were in the car with your mother, you sent the school away somewhere. It's very important that you tell us where you sent it so we can rescue the people who were in it.\"\nBilly looked at his mother, back at Kendall. \"I didn't do anything, it just went away.\"\nKendall's smile widened imperceptibly. \"I know you didn't try to make it go anywhere, it was an accident. What were you thinking at the time?\"\nThe glance at his mother was longer this time. \"I just wanted the school to disappear,\" he admitted finally. His mother gasped softly.\n\"Disappear to where? It's very important.\"\nBilly thought about it for a while. \"Just disappear. I didn't want it to go somewhere else, I just wanted it not to be there.\" He burst into tears.\nJune came and caught his hand. \"That's okay, now. Let's go get you something to eat, okay?\" She winked at Billy's mother, led the child slowly from the room. Mrs. Goldwin rose to follow, but a gesture from Kendall made her sit back down. Emily and Henry silently left the room, uncharacteristically using the door rather than teleporting away.\n\"I've got to tell you a little bit more about your son, Mrs. Goldwin.\"\nMrs. Goldwin nodded slowly.\n\"Every now and then someone's born with the ability your son has. We call it teleportation; the ability to move things from one place to another without touching it or moving it through any of the space in between. About one person in a thousand is able to do it. Of those, about one person in one hundred ever discovers this ability on their own.\n\"But now and then something happens such as with Billy. For some reason or another, they think about an object in a different way than they have before, and `poof', it moves. It's very draining on your energy, in a way more than just simple fatigue. It causes bad dreams and frequently even death. Many `crib death' children are just latent teleporters who teleported something too large to handle in a dream, and died as a result.\n\"We call these people Shifters. They can teleport, but only with some danger and a lot of fatigue. The larger the volume of matter they wish to move, the more energy it takes to move it. Your son was very lucky; most children would have died teleporting a structure as large as that school building.\n\"Now, even ten percent of one in a thousand human beings makes for a fairly large number of people with this ability. When someone manifests this ability, they are usually noticed by one of our people, and brought here.\n\"This place you're in is called the Teletrix Academy, and its graduates are referred to as Teletrix. Billy will be one of those graduates eventually.\"\n\"Billy has to come here?\"\n\"Yes, for a year or so, to learn how to use his gift well. There are techniques that allow a Teletrix to teleport things without using his or her own energy to do it. Also, the terrible side effects, light and thunder, can be avoided by some other tricks. But most importantly, we teach him to use his gift in an ethical fashion. A Teletrix out for personal gain would be a devastating force in the world. There have been a few who we might only call `evil.' They are very dangerous people, and extremely difficult to stop. We'd just as soon make ourselves responsible for his moral training as well.\"\n\"But he has school to attend, and ...\"\n\"Many of our students do; and classes are provided here. You will be allowed to visit at any time. In fact, you may live here if you wish. You might want to take our tests --- you may be a latent Teletrix yourself, although it's not particularly likely.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"And, Mrs. Goldwin, I'm afraid I must insist. You see, he doesn't have a grasp on his abilities, and he's dangerous to others as well as himself. It's quite likely that he killed everyone in that school by teleporting them into outer space, or into the sun, or some other such `accident' merely by ignorance. We can't allow that to happen again. In one year, perhaps less, he may return to the outside world and lead a productive life there. It is never easy to let your son go, but I assure you that it it necessary. I have had this conversation with hundreds of parents over the years, and always reach the same conclusion.\n\"I'm sorry that this had to happen like this. Usually Shifters manifest their powers in some small manner that allows us some time to break the news gently. It wasn't so this time, and training should begin at once before he decides to try again on his own. I am certain that another such attempt would result in his death.\"\nMrs. Goldwin was silent for a long moment. \"It appears I have no choice. I'll have to discuss it with my husband, of course.\"\nKendall nodded. \"I'll help you if you like. June will make sure that Billy is settled in here. My wife's a very pleasant lady, I'm sure he'll get along with her just fine for a while.\"\n\"Your wife... is she a...\"\n\"Teletrix? No, she just had the misfortune of marrying one. I expect her to come to her senses any day.\" Kendall grinned. \"Shall we go?\"\nFive hours later Emily dropped into one of Kendall's office chairs with something halfway between a sigh and a snore. The others in the office had fared little better; Henry was pacing to keep himself alert, Kendall himself was sipping on his fourth cup of coffee in as many hours. June alone looked fresh; somehow she always did.\n\"Nothing,\" Emily said flatly. \"But I suspect you already knew that. There are fifteen thousand Teletrix all over the world looking for that school building.\"\n\"I've still got them looking,\" Kendall acknowledged, \"But I can't see that there's much chance we'll find anything any more. The flash was our best hope, but I've been over all the satellite photos a hundred times. I've been teleporting all over this planet so much I'm developing permanent jet lag.\"\n\"The army's fairly nervous about this, but the press is still in the dark. By the time it leaks, I think it will be old enough news that no one will believe it.\" Henry paused for a few moments. \"Of course, somebody's eventually going to put all of these little stories together and draw some fairly dangerous conclusions, for us.\"\n\"They already have,\" Kendall commented. \"But nobody believes them, either. I doubt the Academy is in any real danger for the time being.\" He looked toward his wife.\nJune shrugged. \"I've been talking to Billy for hours. He continues to insist that he sent the school `nowhere.' I even tried hypnosis. Any memory he has of where he sent it is locked up so tight that he can't get at it either consciously or subconsciously.\"\nHenry tossed his wallet in the air. It vanished, appeared on Kendall's desk. With a slight frown, he teleported it across the room again. The rest of the room's occupants ignored him.\n\"So we're back at a dead end again,\" Kendall said. \"I suppose we're going to have to get some sleep sometime, and I'm beginning to suspect that the school is permanently beyond our reach.\"\nThere was a soft sound of thunder, and Henry's wallet appeared on Kendall's desk in a brilliant flash of light.\n\"I'd almost forgotten how hard it was to teleport on your own power,\" Henry said. He stared at the wallet again, wrinkled his head in concentration. The wallet vanished with the customary pop. There was no corresponding flash of light.\n\"Eureka!\" Henry shouted, and leapt to his feet. Everyone else in the room had been staring at him for several seconds, and flinched at the sudden flurry of motion.\n\"The wallet!\" Henry said. \"Where is it?\"\n\"How should I know?\" Kendall said slowly. \"You teleported it, didn't you?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then where did you send it?\"\n\"Nowhere.\"\nThere was a slight pause as the words settled.\n\"Nowhere?\"\n\"I blanked my mind just as I sent it, failed to specify a destination. It's doesn't drain as much energy as a full teleport, either. That's how Billy managed to survive!\"\nKendall looked him straight in the eye. \"Can you bring it back?\"\nHenry closed his eyes, nodded slowly. \"Yes, I think I can.\"\nLight was suddenly everywhere. When the flash faded, Henry's wallet was in his hand.\n\"Yes, it can be done. But it's as fatiguing to bring it back as to send it. And I think that it's going to have to be Billy who recalls the school.\"\nKendall turned his attention to June. \"What are the chances he'd survive that?\"\nShe shook her head. \"Almost zero. He'll need a couple of weeks at least to recuperate first, and even then it's dangerous. And probably not worth it. Wherever this `nowhere' is, there's not likely to be any air there, is there?\"\nHenry shook his head. \"No probably not.\"\nEmily looked at him for a long moment, then teleported the wallet from his hands. It appeared in her lap in a soft flash of light. Scowling, she tried again. This time, the wallet remained missing.\n\"Bring it back, Henry.\" Her voice was soft.\nHenry closed his eyes for almost a full minute. \"I can't,\" he said simply.\nThere was a flash. \"But I can, easily. So only the person who sends it can get it back.\" Emily shook her head. \"It just seems a shame to leave all those people hanging in limbo, even if they are dead.\"\n\"Any chance that it will just pop back of it's own accord?\" Kendall asked.\nBoth Henry and Emily shrugged.\n\"I think that it's definitely time to get some sleep then. We will all think about this better when we're awake.\"\nEmily nodded, looked at her watch. Suddenly, she pulled the watch from her wrist, glanced at it briefly, and sent it nowhere. Everyone looked up at the pop.\nEmily grinned theatrically, waited almost a full minute, then recalled the watch. She stared at it as though seeing it for the first time.\n\"They're still alive,\" she said quietly. \"Teleportation allows you move from place to place skipping the intervening space. It appears you also skip the intervening time. My watch didn't gain so much as a second while it was gone. So no time is passing for the people in the school.\"\nThe mood of the room brightened noticeably for the first time in several hours.\n\"Good thinking, Emily,\" Kendall said. \"We have a chance of rescuing them. We just wait for Billy to recover, get him to bring the school back. With luck we'll even find a way to do it on a grid and he won't have to use his own energy.\"\nJune looked skeptical, Emily contemplative. Henry gave a sudden, strangled gasp. \"That half a man we found going down the stairs...\"\nKendall sobered instantly. \"Yes. He doesn't even know he's dead.\"\nDawn\nKendall shifted the unfamiliar army uniform on his shoulders, seeking without success to make it more comfortable. Henry stood nearby with a practiced ease; it was not the first time he has worn such a uniform. Both men were carefully scrutinizing the school foundations.\n\"There's a lot of damage to the structure,\" Henry said. \"I rather doubt that the school would continue to stand for more than a couple seconds after being brought back.\"\n\"Which would injure or kill most of the occupants,\" Kendall finished for him. \"Clearly unacceptable. So what do we do?\"\nHenry shook his head. \"If we knew exactly where the people were, we could probably teleport them out before the building collapsed. But there's no way to know that I can see.\"\n\"Could we rebuild the foundation so that the school would stand?\"\n\"I thought of that,\" Henry replied. \"But we don't know how. The blueprints were destroyed in a fire some years ago, and in any case we don't know exactly how much of the school was taken and how much left. I'm not sure that it would work in any case; the sudden weight on the foundations would be likely to break them.\"\n\"Any chance that there are any blueprints left somewhere? Interior drawings or photographs? If we knew the complete structure of the building we could drop a teleport shield on it, immobilize it in one place long enough for the people to get out.\"\nHenry considered for several seconds. \"That sounds awfully dangerous. There aren't any blueprints, but we could probably find photographs of the interior. But even if we could completely reconstruct the inside it would probably take several Teletrix working together to keep the geometry straight, and if we weren't perfectly synchronized we'd probably just accelerate the destruction.\"\nKendall's spun suddenly toward Henry. \"Of course! You're a genius, Henry!\"\n\"Of course. But my brilliance is such that escapes even me at the moment. What did I say?\"\n\"Never mind, I need to think about it some more. But we've probably got a solution to that problem. The next question is, how do we cover this all up?\"\nHenry smiled slowly. \"Emily and I had a discussion about that last night. She had an idea that's so outrageous it can't fail.\"\nKendall snorted. \"I can't wait. Let's get back to the office.\"\nHenry spread his map out on Kendall's desk. Emily stood at his side; Kendall sat in his usual chair. Each grabbed a corner to prevent the paper from rerolling itself.\n\"Here's the major camp, and the latrines,\" Henry said, pointing. \"Everyone not on duty will be there. They've erected a tent over the school foundations to keep the gawkers away; the on-duty patrols will be right around the tent to keep away suspicious people. Nevertheless, there will probably be a crowd of worried parents over here, in the compound.\"\n\"Any chance there will be stragglers?\"\n\"It's always possible, but not likely. I've been watching them for a week now, and they've been relatively invariant in their routine. But if there are, the others know what to do with them, so it won't be a big deal.\"\n\"Good,\" Kendall said, glancing at his watch. \"We have about ten minutes. I'll take the parents, Henry, you get the tent and the patrols, Emily, the main camp is yours. Then start looking for anyone we missed. Meet me here when you're done.\" He tapped the map. \"Any questions?\"\n\"I question your sanity,\" Emily said. \"Other than that, no.\"\n\"That's what you're there for,\" Kendall said. \"If something goes wrong with this plan, get that school back into the nether as fast as you can.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nKendall checked his watch again. \"Nine and a half minutes exactly. Let's go!\"\nThe office was replaced with starry darkness. Kendall slid across the night toward the small rope-enclosed compound. Perhaps sixty people were in it, despite the hour; tents and sleeping bags were omnipresent.\nKendall closed his eyes, brought forth an image of the yellow grid that was so much a part of his talent. Normally he would have required neither concentration nor the closed eyes, but the task he performed now was still relatively new, and there was little room for error.\nHe mentally cut away half of the grid, imagining the lines fading to nothing in one direction, opened his eyes. Superimposing the grid upon the enclosure and the public latrines beyond, he concentrated on the nothing beyond his grid and gave a short mental push.\nUsually he would have pulled air from the other end of the grid to fill the space, but tonight he just performed a second teleport a few moments later, sucking air from over an ocean hundreds of miles away.\nThere was just the slightest rumble, a gentle breeze, then silence. The compound and its occupants were gone.\nA crash of thunder from beyond the trees told him that Henry had been less successful, but it no longer mattered. Kendall smiled to himself, and flickered to the meeting place.\nThe army and the tent were gone, sent into an empty nowhere, out of space and time. The school foundation was barely visible in the near-complete darkness.\nHenry and Emily were already there. A few moments later they were joined by June and Billy, who had been hiding nearby for several minutes.\n\"So far, so good,\" Kendall said. He kept his voice at a whisper despite the fact that there was no one to hear except the five people gathered in the clearing. \"Now the fun begins. Emily, you should probably sit in that tree over there to give you a better view. If you think something's wrong, you know what to do.\"\nEmily nodded, and vanished.\nJune carried two large briefcases. She handed one to Henry, the other to Kendall. \"It took myself and about fifty academy folks all day to get this stuff into two thousand containers. Don't drop those cases or the whole county will go to sleep. And not wake up.\"\n\"No problem,\" Henry said. \"We'll try not to break them.\"\nHe hefted his case and vanished.\nDarkness prevailed for a few seconds longer.\nThere was a sudden flurry of activity. Four helicopters appeared silently in the air, dropped slightly as they adjusted to the pressure change from their source. Moments later the whirring of their blades filled the night. Everywhere men and women were materializing, filling the schoolyard with humanity. These people turned and ran for the edge of the concrete playground, only to be replaced fifteen seconds later with a new batch. And so it continued, again and again, until fully two thousand people stood waiting.\nEquipment began appearing, transferred fully constructed from a storeroom beneath the Colorado Rockies. Wooden towers, bleachers, ladders, and other paraphernalia were quickly set up. Seventeen huge searchlights illuminated the air over the school foundations.\nKendall strode to the playground as the activity slowly settled into an expectant silence. His wife and Billy followed slowly. Two thousand Teletrix had arranged themselves about the school, where they could view it from every angle. They stood silently, waiting.\nKendall summoned a megaphone, spoke into it.\n\"Thank you all for coming this evening. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, but we could think of no other way of resolving this problem without your aid.\n\"You have all been instructed in what to do. Please remember that time will be very short; you may have as long as ten seconds, but four is a more likely guess. At this time you should arrange yourself so that each of you can see where the school will appear.\"\nThere was a slight shifting of the crowd.\nKendall opened the briefcase he held. On the other side of the empty foundation, Henry did the same. Within, hundreds of vials of a white powder glimmered.\n\"Each of you should take one of these. Be very careful with it; do not breath it or break it.\"\nThe briefcase emptied rapidly.\nKendall looked at June expectantly. She nodded once, placed her hand on Billy's shoulder.\n\"Do you remember our lessons? It's time to bring the school back. But you must be very careful to do it the way Henry showed you. Don't make any light.\"\nBilly smiled. \"I can do it.\" He closed his eyes, opened them, then closed them again. Finally, he opened them and turned toward June.\n\"It didn't work.\"\nKendall swore silently.\nJune was more gentle. \"Just try again, Billy.\"\nBilly nodded skeptically, turned toward the hole in the ground, and closed his eyes.\nWithout a whisper, the school flickered back into existence.\nAlmost immediately, the ceiling of the top floor vanished, the walls following a fraction of a second later as a thousand Teletrix teleported bits and pieces of the building away. People within became visible, frozen by a shock that had not yet had time to fully register. The remaining Teletrix teleported them into the playground as quickly as they became visible. Inside of a second, none remained on the top floor.\nThe school began to tilt crazily to one side. The low rumbling only drove the Teletrix to faster speeds. The middle floor was eaten away, it's people pulled out and added to the collection in the playground as they became appeared. When none remained, the bottom floor, too, began to disappear like sand in a strong wind.\nThe walls now began to collapse, but it was far to late to make any difference. Even as they fell, the walls vanished, the students and teachers flickered to safety The bottom floor collapsed inward, but there was no one left on it.\nKendall watched the school vanish piecemeal until he was sure everyone who could be rescued was out. But there was still an occupant of the building.\nKendall met Henry in the ruins of the basement, seeking half a man. They found him without too much trouble, his body just beginning to realize it was in pain. Henry and Kendall had discussed this for hours in the preceeding days, but their decision pleased neither of them.\nWith a flash of his mind, Kendall sent the man almost a hundred million miles away. His body was consumed instantly and painlessly by the fusion furnace of the sun.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Kendall said quietly. \"But this is the only thing we could do for you.\"\nHenry and Kendall stared at the empty place where he had been for several long minutes, silently, then teleported back to the playground.\nIn the time they had been gone, the equipment had vanished. Each of the Teletrix had chosen a single resident of the school and taken him or her home. The drug June had distributed created a sleep laced with enough dreams to blur the line between reality and nightmare. The events of the night would be pieced together vaguely, if at all. For the people in the school, day would have become night, their minds disoriented. The school would still be gone when they awoke, but with luck they would not remember being in it.\nAt the end of it all, only Henry, Emily, and Kendall remained. One of the Teletrix had taken June and Billy back to the Colorado office.\n\"It's not a perfect success,\" Emily said. \"We had a couple of bumps and bruises from falling bricks, but nothing that a little time won't cure. Plus, of course, it will be impossible to hide the signs of all those people here, but that will be only a minor mystery. The tabloids will probably pass us off as space aliens.\"\nKendall nodded. \"That and the fact that every soldier and parent here tonight is going to find their watch a few minutes slow.\"\n\"Speaking of which,\" Henry said, \"it's been almost ten minutes since we took out the natives. We'd best get them back before they get too much out of kilter. Keeps the mystery count low.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\nThe three of them separated to their former positions.\nReturning the parents' compound was easier. Kendall merely superimposed a whole grid over the empty scene, and bled the energy of transport into it. Silently and lightlessly the compound reappeared, the air it replaced ending up somewhere over the Pacific.\nFive minutes later, wine glasses clinked over Martin Kendall's desk.\n\"Well, we did it. Only one casualty, and little disruption. When the missing people reappear tomorrow morning, this whole thing should pass. Eventually, the army will get tired of guarding that now-useless hole in the ground and go home.\" Kendall raised his glass. \"I'd like to thank all of you for your help, especially Billy here.\"\nBilly took a sip from his glass. \"It's good!\" he said.\n\"Indeed,\" Kendall said. \"Best lemonade I've ever tasted.\"\nChristopher Kempke is a dangerous, psychopathic Computer Science graduate student with too much time on his hands.

My answer is not a simple one. When I asked the elders why our world exists as it does, one of them sat me down at the edge of the river and spoke to me. He pointed out an eddy near the edge of the stream, and said that we could consider it a turning point in the universe. It could be the assassination of Abraham Lincoln; the moment Einstein first wondered about general relativity; the birth of a man who would become Czar of Russia or a tyrannical Brazilian dictator; perhaps even an event that didn't happen, like the assassination of FDR, an event that would have, through the cascade of effects it caused, changed the world. Such a thing may seem strange to you, the idea that we can treat the flow of history as a river, with eddies and currents. But to me it made some sort of sense, if only because I was raised among the elders. I will never be able to explain to you the subtleties of our reality-to give you a tidy paragraph for the latest Oxford English Dictionary or a groundbreaking article for the next issue of _Science_. But perhaps I can give you a frame to better explain what we are doing here. One can not explain the universe in conventional terms-one can only try to explain it metaphorically. Stories about swimming and diving will come from my mouth, but within will be the truth about everything around us. You must try to interpret it for yourself and decide whether the truth is acceptable to you. If not, I suggest you to ignore my words and pretend that this life is nothing more than a dream.\nThere was I (call me Eve, Ruth, Rachel or any other name buried deep in your past) sitting at the edge of the stream with Palmer next to me, both of us staring at the eddy, trying to imagine what human events hid within. The inconceivable mechanics of reality that I spoke of, concepts I can not relate in any language your mind would comprehend, were a part of my education there. I sat, and as I stared at the eddy, Palmer removed his shoes and stepped into the water. One might have asked the elder why he was entering the stream on such a cold day, but the mud stirred up by his steps held a great deal more interest. It chose to swirl-to say that the mud actively chose such a path only shows the inherent intelligence I saw in that motion-and eventually broke into two divergent floes. One might view the split streams of mud as two possible realities- a choice made, and a road not taken. It is a concept that appears throughout human history (my thoughts on this subject are hardly original), and one that is more truthful than people think. Our universe is like that stream of mud, constantly diverging as individuals make different choices and walk down different paths. This is not by any means the realm of science- fiction. Some of your great modern thinkers ponder the question under the name \"chaos theory,\" a term that belies the poetic nature of the concept. A butterfly chooses to flap its wings and rise up from its resting place on a patch of ground in central China, and its passage through the air eventually leads to the creation of a tornado in central Kansas-but then Palmer turned around and motioned me forward, asking me to join him in the water.\nThat an elder so versed in the ways of time and space should risk pneumonia in a muddy stream is a puzzling matter. Old and fragile, his days as one of the tribe's strongest men past, he should not have been allowed to risk his life in the cold waters. But before I could tell him of my concern, he told me to dive with him. Palmer's heels dropped below the surface and I had no real choice but to follow.\nIt is strange to think that of all the ways to describe the water in that stream, I have only discussed its temperature. To be sure, the cold of the water was foremost in my thoughts as I dove in after Palmer. But more importantly, I found that I could actually breathe while immersed in the water. My body had been shocked when it was suddenly immersed in the incredibly cold water, and I uncontrollably (and quite stupidly) gasped in response. The liquidfor then I realized that it was not water after all-filled my lungs, and I was afraid I would drown. But my fears, of which there were many, were unfounded. At the time I felt lightheaded, as if I had breathed in too deeply. Then I found myself standing with Palmer on warm, dry land, as if we had never stepped into the stream.\nShould I try and explain where the elder and I appeared? It was a place unlike any I had seen before, a rocky outcropping with no vegetation of any kind. The ground beneath was hard lava, unforgiving on my soles. This, said Palmer, is the far side of the stream. This place was a different world, an Earth where life never evolvedwhere that fortuitous spark that created the first cell never came. Then I felt lightheaded again, and found myself back in the stream again. As with all lessons the elders taught us, there was no further discussion of what I had seen; no chance to compare notes with other students; no way to explore the stream by ourselves.\nSo I can tell you that this place is the other side of the stream you have walked on for many years. This is another world, a world where the choices we have made have been different. You asked me if I could show you what the world would be like if you had never been born, and I have done the best I can. I know that this world has been destroyed; and I know that your mother's unfortunate miscarriage in this world is part of that; and I know that the stretch of rubble we now stand in is a city in our world; and, using my powers of deduction, I can suppose that your presence in our world has saved it from this fate. This starry sky shines down on a dead world-all because you never lived. Yes, there is a way back. We will return to our world, a world where you still live-and perhaps now you shall appreciate your importance.\nJason Snell (jsnell@ucsd.edu) is a firstyear student at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism.

The SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) transmitters had been wildly successful even if the outcome of the project wasn't exactly what its founders had in mind. Make no mistake about it, it was an exciting time to be a newsman. You could see it in the headlines blazing the news all across the country: Earth Attacked by Space Aliens From the Andromeda Galaxy! Alien Base on Far Side of Moon! Far-out Foreigners Fight European Forces, Immediate Surrender Demanded!\nYes indeed, a very exciting time to be a newspaper reporter. Unless of course, like me, you were assigned to the agricultural beat in rural Idaho! Yes, Space Aliens were set to land on the White House lawn, governments all over the world were contemplating the future of mankind and was I covering the story? Was I in the front lines, poised to garner fame and glory? No. I was driving my old, beat-up Subaru out to Arco, Idaho to visit with the object of this week's farmer spotlight, Lester W. McGill, an eccentric potato farmer. McGill had designed or adapted some electronic gadgets for the purpose of getting his spuds into and out of the ground more efficiently! Lucky me! See article and photos, page 6C, just beneath the obituaries, right above the ad for ribbed implement tires!\nSurely there would be a reward for me in the afterlife, I thought, because I was certainly doing my penance now!\nThe radio signal on the all-news station had faded away as I went behind the mountains, taking me out of touch with the news that I craved. All the other stations were playing country-western music. Dolly Parton and Waylon Jennings don't know much 'bout flyin' saucers.\nMercifully, I finally found the farm out on RR 2 Arco. Right where they said it would be. You've heard the directions before: \"Yeah, ya'll jus' go on down pas' the feed store and take the firs' turn to the lef' and go `bout one and a half mile to that big center pivot irr-ee-gation rig, then ya'll head straight for them Lemhi Mountains. Ya'll cain't miss the farm, It's the one with the gee-o-deesik dome out back!\"\nThis means, of course that you'll never find it on your first try! Or your second. I did well to find it on my third, mostly because of the geodesic dome, which made me some 28 minutes late for my appointment. I did know from experience, however, that these folks were used to time being somewhat flexible so I didn't worry overmuch.\nAs expected, the McGill place was a complete mess! This guy was one of those fellows who collected all manner of junk, preferably that which he could get for free or for a low, low price. He'd cart these treasures back to the farm with big plans for modifying them or salvaging parts from them but inevitably wound up forgetting about them when he got sidetracked by something even more compelling. If this process is given enough time, the junk will eventually overwhelm the entire yard. The saturation point had been reached sometime ago at McGill's, but that hadn't stopped the junk from continuing to accumulate.\nSome of the hulks and bits of rusted metal were recognizable as old farm implements or truck parts while others were weird conglomerations of the familiar, the somewhat familiar, and the very strange. You know the kind of stuff I mean, someone's dream of a better mousetrap or spud planter or what-have-you that took a lot of time but didn't work out quite right and is now longforgotten. From the looks of things, McGill had been the undertaker for other people's dream machines for a good many years! In spite of myself, I was intrigued; I'd always been fascinated by junk yards.\nI slung my camera bag over my shoulder and grasped my note pad in my hand as I waded through the junk and knocked on the front door of a crooked little house that had, at one time, been white. While I waited for a response, I noticed that the front lawn was long, weedy and unkempt.\nMrs. McGill was wiping her hands on a red gingham apron when she opened the door to let me in. She was a short, slender middle-aged lady, well preserved with clear blue eyes and an honest, farmer's-wife face. The only concession she made to her age was her hair color. It was an awful outof-the-bottle pinkish-red that looks so damned unnatural, that it makes you shake your head in wonder at why people would actually pay money to have someone do that to their hair. Naturally, I told her I liked it.\nThe house reminded me of my Grandma's place. It was permeated with the smell of fresh-baked bread and freshbrewed coffee. In sharp contrast to the outside, the interior of the house was primly decorated and neat as a pin. It was as though the front door was the border between two distinct worlds chaos without and order within!\n\"You're the reporter from the `Eastern Idaho Sentinel' ain't you?\" she said, with that endearing Western accent that you either come to love so well or to really hate if you live out here long enough.\n\"Yes, Ma'am,\" I replied, reverting to the local dialect, \"Trevor Dahlgren, at your service!\"\n\"Here, Mr. Dahlgren, take this basket o' cinnamon rolls, an' I'll take this tray o' coffee and cups an' we'll go out back to the gee-o-deezic dome. That's where Les is workin' right now.\"\nI followed the slight, almost frail form of Mrs. McGill (there are no Ms. out here in this part of the country!) across the junk-strewn farmyard out to the largish geodesic dome with the imposing outlines of the snow-capped Lemhi mountain range outlined against the sky behind it.\n\"Ain't thet somethin' 'bout them Space Aliens, Mr. Dahlgren?\"\n\"Yes, Mrs. McGill, it certainly is! Please, call me Trevor.\"\n\"My name's Dorothy. Well never fear, Mr. Trevor, my Les is gonna save the world. Fact is, you got here jus' in time.\"\n\"I... ah... what exactly do you mean, Mrs. Mc... er... Dorothy?\"\n\"You'll see, Mr. Trevor, you'll see.\"\nBy then we were at the door to the geodesic dome and I could get no more out of the little woman. Both of us ducked our heads and stepped over a rather tallish sill to enter through the hexagonal door. I noticed as we went in that the door was of a very hefty construction and that the structure of the dome itself had an inner wall about a foot inside the outer skin.\nThe inside of the dome was something else again. I can't say what I expected, but it certainly wasn't what I found!\nWe went up a set of metal stairs to the main floor of the building which was about six feet above ground level. The interior of the dome was brightly lit and criss-crossed with I-beam braces in an apparent attempt to increase the structure's strength. All around the perimeter, along the walls, was a continuous conglomeration of strange-looking, cobbled-together machinery.\nIn the center of the room was a John Deere tractor, minus the rear wheels. In place of the rear wheels was what appeared to be a very large electric generator. From the generator, a huge cable, fully six inches in diameter, disappeared into the floor. A length of large diameter flexpipe connected the exhaust pipe of the tractor to another hole in the floor. In place of the tractor seat was a bucket seat with a headrest that looked like it had been lifted from 1969 Camaro. The new instrument panel was a plethora of digital and analog gauges with, strangest of all, a cable coming out of the middle of it that was connected to what looked like a Nintendo control. All around the room, electrical cables and wires ran everywhere, helterskelter, across the floor and up the walls.\nI looked up at the ceiling and noticed that the geodesic pattern of the upper portion of the dome had a ring of the hexagonal panels replaced with a clear material, making a sort of skylight. Several other panels, at eye level and at sixty degree intervals around the structure were similarly replaced, making for a series of windows.\nAcross the building, bent over one of the arcane machines, was a tall, skinny man, with sparse, graying hair who had to be Lester W. McGill. He had a sort of \"Lester\" look about him, if you know what I mean. He was dressed in a pair of those striped light-blue bib overalls that all good farmers wear you know the ones, the kind that you buy already dirty. As he turned in response to our entry, I saw that he wore an old-fashioned pair of tiny, round, wire-rimmed glasses on his hawklike nose below his close-set and somewhat wild-looking hazel eyes.\nJust to McGill's left was a shorter man who also turned around and looked up from his work. He was young, handsome and Latin. Probably a Mexican hired hand, I thought.\nLester didn't even introduce himself. Instead he spoke to his wife, who was right behind me.\n\"Dorothy, put that stuff down here and ya'll get back to the house and grab them bags I had you pack this mornin'. Make sure to grab my chewing tobacco out of the cupboard on the way. Hurry now, we ain't got much time!\" He must have remembered our phone conversation of the day before because he guessed right off who I was.\n\"I'm Lester McGill, and you'll be Mr. Dahlgren - Trevor Dahlgren. That right?\"\n\"Ye... ss,\" I managed to stammer out. His air of urgency had caught me off guard.\n\"Well, Dahlgren, you got here just in time. We need your help.\"\n\"Okay, Sure,\" I said, still rather in shock.\n\"This here's Juan. Help him load up a few supplies if you would. I'll explain everything later.\"\nJuan and I took a few minutes to carry, among other things, six sacks of potatoes into the dome. Over the high door sill and up the six feet of stairs. Those suckers were heavy! I was sweating as we dropped the last one onto the newly formed pile along one side of the dome. Juan smiled at my discomfort, flashing even, white teeth.\n\"What are these for, Mr. McGill?\"\n\"Lester,\" he said evenly. \"Spuds? You never know what we might be up against in the next few days or weeks. Spuds are good food. Good enough so's my Irish ancestors used them as for their only food for a good many years.\" He stopped and scratched his chin. \"'Course, there was that damned famine!\"\n\"Food?\" I asked, and then repeated Lester's own words. \"What we might be up against in the next few days or weeks? What do you mean, Lester?\"\n\"Why, we're gonna save the world from them aliens, that's what!\"\nJust then, Dorothy returned with several suitcases, some tins of Copenhagen, and a large, unkempt, Heinz-fifty-seven breed farm dog. Dorothy had changed into a very practical pair of blue jeans and a pink sweatshirt. The outfit looked nice on her; the sweatshirt even matched her hair.\n\"Close the door,\" Lester called out to Juan. Juan swung a massive door closed and spun the handwheel in the center. I was reminded of the outer hull door that I'd seen in those old WW II submarine movies. \"Sit, Balthazer,\" Lester told the dog. The beast obediently sat. Then Lester turned back to me.\n\"The aliens are going to land in Washington,\" I said.\n\"That's right,\" said Lester. \"An' we're going there after 'em. We did a little test on our powerplant a few minutes ago and now we're ready. Bring your notepad and your camera, Dahlgren, 'cause, by Gawd, your gonna get some news!\"\n\"Powerplant?\" I asked.\n\"Hell yes, boy! Ain't you figured things out yet? This here gee-o-deesik dome is a spaceship an' we're going to war! Bein' a red-blooded American and a Idahoan, I just hates them gad-damned aliens!\"\nWith that he went over and hunkered his lanky frame into the bucket seat, snapped himself into a three-point seat belt and picked up the control module (I looked carefully, it was a Nintendo control!). Juan, meanwhile, had placed himself in front of a very new-looking Zeos PC and monitor on a bucket seat that appeared to be the mate of the one on the tractor. I heard the unmistakable sound of a starter motor, followed by the equally unmistakable roar of a diesel engine. I hoped that the exhaust pipe was vented to the outside or things were gonna get mighty uncomfortable inside our \"gee-odeesik\" dome!\n\"Find a place to sit down, Dahlgren. We're takin' off!\"\nIn a state of numbed shock, I sat down next to Dorothy in a short row of what appeared to be used theater chairs. I found a somewhat worn lap belt and strapped in. Balthazer came over and took a station laying at my feet with his head up and his ears pricked.\nWe did not have an overlong wait for the next set of developments. Lester put the remains of the tractor in gear and let out the clutch as he simultaneously manipulated the Nintendo control. I felt a strangely familiar sensation of movement, like the feeling you get when a fast elevator whooshes upwards - except that this sensation was almost brutal in its intensity and it lasted for considerably longer.\n\"Yeee haa!\" shouted Lester. \"It worked, I knew it would work!\"\nI saw the outline of the Lemhi Mountain range go past one of the hexagonal windows. It occurred to me that maybe I'd better start referring to them as \"viewports.\"\n\"I'll be a son-of-a-bitch,\" I said aloud. \"This thing is a God-damned spaceship!\" As soon as the acceleration diminished, I got out of my seat to gaze out of the nearest of the viewports. It was just like the pictures from the space shuttle, the large sphere of the earth all blue and white with a smattering of brown and green showing through the white. Below I could make out the Oregon coast line, off to the left. We were already in orbit! This thing could really fly!\nLester didn't waste any time. \"Gimme a vector for Washington DC would you, Juan?\"\nJuan's fingers rapidly caressed the keyboard of the Zeos. In less than five seconds he called out, \"Heading 386, Les. Tell me when you reach 25 minutes so I can activate the atmospheric compensation shields before we re-enter the atmosphere.\"\nJuan's English was almost flawless, with just a hint of a Spanish accent. Whatever he might have been, Juan was no hired hand! In spite of the exhilaration and shock caused by the recent turn of events, my experience as a reporter kicked in. Almost automatically, I began to ask a few questions.\n\"I don't believe I got your full name or what it is that you do, Juan.\" He swiveled his Camaro bucket seat around to face me and smiled smugly as he replied.\n\"Dr. Juan Ramirez de la Vega, at your service. Quantum physicist by training. Now, as you can see, I'm a practicing Astrophysicist. I am originally from Venezuela and was educated at Cal Poly before I did a stint at Fermilab. Until about six months ago, I was at INEL right over near Arco,\" (INEL is the famous Idaho National Engineering Laboratories where they do all the nuclear research out here in the deserts of Idaho. Needless to say, I was impressed!).\n\"Did you design this ship?\"\n\"Not really, although I helped with some of the subsystems. This is Lester's brainchild. He came out to our project at INEL to pick up an old experimental fusion torus that we were getting rid of. The INEL authorities thought he wanted it for the more than two miles of copper wire in it. He and I struck up a conversation and it soon became apparent to me that such was not the case. Lester had some very intriguing ideas. That was about a year ago. One thing led to another and soon I was working evenings out at the farm. Things were finally going so well that I resigned my position at INEL about two months ago. Lester and I have been working almost full-time together ever since.\"\n\"How does this ... ah ... spaceship work?\"\n\"I cannot explain the mechanisms to someone who does not have a thorough knowledge of higher mathematics, and like anything that has to do with quantum physics, a large dash of faith is also required, but I shall do my best.\"\nJuan got up from his console and walked over next to the tractor were Lester was busy manipulating the Nintendo control and watching his readouts. We both stepped back as a wad of chewed tobacco winged past us and into a trash can next to the tractor.\n\"That old fusion torus is beneath the floor here, but there is some eighteen inches of concrete between us and the torus. There is a twofold purpose for this. One, to give us some protection and two, to provide some extra mass.\"\nBalthazer had followed us over. He sat on his haunches between us with his head cocked to one side. It didn't bother me, he was probably getting as much out of this as I was.\n\"Protection?\" I asked.\n\"We were just being careful at the beginning of our experiments. It is not really an issue.\"\n\"Ah, good,\" I replied, only partially convinced. Dr. de la Vega continued his guided tour.\n\"This machine back here, connected to the tractor, that looks like a generator is really the secret of the whole apparatus. The device actually does generate electrical power but it does so in a very special way. Again, there is a lot of math involved but it is fairly accurate to say that this current is at right angles to our normal universe.\"\n\"Right angles to the normal universe?\"\nWe dodged another wad of tobacco juice.\n\"That's right Dahlgren,\" said Lester, reaching for his tin of Copenhagen, \"the ee-lectrical field is kitty-wumpus to ol' terra firma here. Took me near on to a year to make it work!\"\nJuan waited politely through the interruption, nodded in agreement and continued: \"When you apply that power to the right sized torus, you get an antigravity drive system that taps into the magnetic lines of force of the universe itself! That's why the extra mass of the concrete is so important. To put it simply, we can actually magnify the slab's puny gravitational force several hundred million times - only it is a negative or anti-gravity field.\"\n\"You do all that with the front half of a John Deere 4020 tractor?\" I asked, incredulously.\n\"Oh yes. We don't need a large power source because, in actuality, we are merely channelling a minuscule portion of a huge reservoir of power rather than generating the power ourselves.\"\n\"Wow,\" I said, nodding my head as if I understood. Next to me, Balthazer nodded too.\n\"There's more,\" said Juan. \"Modulate the power through the converter over here - he pointed to a breadbox sized mass of exposed electrical components - and you can generate shields. Almost any type of shield you want, anti-energy or atmospheric or meteorite. If we'd had a few more weeks we might even have come up with some weapons from this technology.\"\nThe reference to weapons brought me back to reality, reminding me of the purpose of our little jaunt. We were about to engage an enemy from outer space, that we knew little about, with a barnyard creation from a farm in the mountains of Idaho! Without any weapons!? Did I mention that these same aliens had brought the modern armed forces of Europe to their knees in just under two weeks!\nI began to get a little nervous.\n\"You mean we haven't got any weapons?\" I asked. Under the circumstances, I thought it was fair question.\n\"Weapons? Yeah, we got weapons,\" said Lester. Before he could elaborate, the two men had to get back to work.\n\"Twenty-five minutes, Juan.\"\n\"Very good, Les. Washington dead ahead.\"\nI swallowed heavily. A life-long ambition, to actually get into space, had been fulfilled, Unfortunately, it didn't look as though I was going to get much of a chance to savor the experience!\nWe descended almost noiselessly through the atmosphere. Soon, I could make out the unmistakable skyline of our nation's capital. Seemingly on guard about the dome of the capital hovered three glowing, pulsating, saucer-shaped objects, each about the size of a 747.\n\"Andromedan space craft, dead ahead, Les,\" said Juan. He was now working continuously at the Zeos console.\n\"Yep, I sees `em. Dorothy, git the shotgun.\"\n\"Right away, Lester.\"\n\"Dahlgren, ya'll git the door so's the Missus can git a shot at them aliens, would ya?\"\nWell, this made a lot of sense! We were facing three war vessels of a highly advanced alien race who hadn't even been marked by all the sophisticated weaponry that Europe could throw at them and we were about to attack them nothing more advanced than a double-barreled shotgun! I said as much.\n\"Never fear, Dahlgren,\" drawled Lester, \"It's double 0 buckshot!\"\n\"That's a relief!\" I yelled. \"Buckshot or birdshot, what's the difference?\"\n\"Jus' calm down and open the door, Mr. Trevor,\" soothed Dorothy. I rolled my eyes, but did as I was told. What the hell, I thought, we aren't going to live through the day anyway.\nWith the door open, Lester swung the ship around until we could see the alien vessels through it. They were only a few hundred feet away. I could hear a strange humming noise that rose and fell in intensity with the pulsations in the glow of the saucers. Balthazer's hackles came up as he bared his teeth at them and growled.\n\"Take a bead on the lead one, Ma,\" said Lester. \"Ya'll be ready to slam that door, Dahlgren. We may need to git to hell outta here in a hurry!\"\nThat was the first sane thing I'd heard all day!\n\"Okay, Pa, I'm ready!\" sang out Dorothy.\n\"Git ready with them energy shields, Juan.\"\n\"Ready, Les.\"\n\"Fire away, Ma!\"\nKa-whump! Ka-whump! Dorothy rocked back from the recoil of the shots but, farm girl that she was, seemed unaffected otherwise. The noise was deafening in the enclosed space of the dome! Wonder of wonders, the lead alien ship was ... Totally unharmed! But we had gotten their attention! Balthazer began barking uncontrollably as the saucers got brighter and the pulsations increased in frequency.\n\"Shields, Juan! Door, Dahlgren!\"\nI noticed a faint blue haze appear around the hull of the dome as I slammed the door and spun the wheel to lock it. The lights dimmed and the dome lurched and rang like a bell as we took what I presumed to be a direct hit from the lead alien ship. By now, Balthazer was at one of the viewports continuing to bark furiously.\n\"Hey, Juan, them shields work too!\" shouted Lester. \"Looks like we'd better high-tail it outta here! Take your seats, folks! Shut up, Balthazer!\" The big dog obeyed immediately and bounded back over to resume his station at my feet.\nWe took two more hits, without apparent harm, before the now familiar elevator sensation struck us again. This time the intensity was far worse as the diesel engine roared at full throttle.\n\"They're following us,\" said Juan, matter of factly.\n\"Good,\"\n\"They're gaining,\"\n\"Yeah, I figured they might,\"\n\"What, now, McGill?\" I couldn't believe that we were still alive, but found that I rather liked the sensation, if you get my drift.\n\"Well, now that we're out of the atmosphere we can try some other things,\" replied Lester. To my horror, he throttled down the diesel and pushed in the clutch on the wheelless tractor!\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n\"We're gonna try her in second.\" I heard the crunch of a gear change. The clutch came back out and the engine rpm increased. I was slammed into my seat by a hither-to unimaginable force. Even the stalwart Balthazer whimpered from the pain.\n\"Good,\" said Juan, \"They're falling back. You should apply the throttle a little more gently in the higher gears, Les. That was almost painful. Or should we activate the artificial gravity maintenance module?\"\n\"It's gotta be the ARTGRAV module, Juan. That last blast made me see spots before my eyes!\"\n\"It appears we have little choice, Les. The alien ships are again gaining on us.\"\n\"Let's do the ARTGRAV and then see what happens.\"\n\"Right,\" said Juan, as he flipped a series of switches on a console near the Zeos.\nImmediately, the sensation of being in a moving elevator ceased and I felt no different than if we were on the ground, back on the farm.\n\"Why didn't you do that before?\" I asked.\n\"Unfortunately, we haven't gotten all the bugs out of it yet,\" said Juan. Almost as if on cue, my stomach did a series of flip-flops and, just as quickly went back to normal. Lester, his aim upset by the gravity fluctuation, missed the trash can with his latest wad of tobacco.\n\"Damn!\" Lester swore artfully.\n\"As you can see, there is an intermittent flaw in our ARTGRAV system that we haven't been able to trace down. I suppose that we shall have to learn to live with it.\"\nThe diesel again throttled down to an idle, followed by the clashing of gears.\n\"Third gear,\" sang out Lester. The clutch grabbed and the engine roared.\n\"The aliens are falling back again, Les.\"\n\"Good,\" Lester replied, scratching his chin. \"I been thinkin', Juan. How fas' we goin\"'\n\"Mother of God!\" said Juan, as his fingers flew across the Zeos keyboard. \"We are currently at Mach 165.8 and accelerating!\"\n\"What happens if you was to run inta somethin' at Mach 165.8, Juan?\"\n\"It is safe to say that there would be a great deal of energy released.\"\n\"Yep, that's what I figgered. Anybody followin' us.\"\n\"Not, right now. They seem to have given up.\"\n\"Good, I'm stoppin' here then.\"\nAs good as his word, Lester throttled down and pushed in the clutch.\n\"I got an idee,\" said Lester, but he wouldn't tell any one what it was until he had flipped the ship around slowed it down to a mere mach 5.\n\"We're gonna hafta open the outer door for a coupl'a minutes,\" said Lester, as he unbuckled and got up out of his Camaro seat.\n\"How do you propose that we do that?\" I asked.\n\"Hell, boy, we got us some space suits! I think we even got one in your size! You'll get to see space all up close and personal!\"\n\"Why me?\" I pleaded, as I swallowed nervously.\n\"Cause I got a bad back - old farm accident, you know - and the Missus ain't strong enough. Stop yer whimperin', boy, yer worse than Balthazer. Juan'll help ya.\"\nIt appeared as though I had little choice. The space suits themselves did not exactly inspire confidence either. They were, like almost everything else on board the ship, cobbled together from used and unrelated parts. In fact, the two suits weren't even remotely similar. Mine was made out of a fifty-gallon drum with a rectangular plexiglass window and what looked like flexible clothes dryer hose for arms and legs, while Juan's looked like the main part of it was from an old deep sea diver's rig, complete with brass headpiece. It had a number of patches and worn-looking spots on it and some other parts that didn't quite match.\n\"We're ready Lester,\" said Juan.\nLester and Dorothy looked us both over. Lester smiled and thumped on the fifty-gallon drum which rang hollowly even with me inside it. He spoke loudly so we could both hear him through our suits. But, what he said didn't make much sense to me.\n\"Jus' drag three of them sacks of spuds over to the airlock. When you gets the outside door open, just open 'em up one at a time and shake them taters out into space.\" Juan nodded in understanding; I just shook my head.\nWe accomplished our mission with little trouble but I couldn't help wishing for some momentous quote to fit the occasion. Something like: \"Small potatoes for a man, a giant tater tot for mankind ...\" Naturally, you'd have to go to the frozen foods section because, of course, the spuds had frozen solid immediately in the cold vacuum of space.\nThen, against all common sense, we went back to taunt the three alien vessels.\nLester brought us in really close. Too close, I thought and wiggled the ship seductively to get them to follow us. They reacted immediately, like starved hounds they were after us in an instant. Balthazer loved every minute of it, standing up on his hind legs, barking enthusiastically, with his nose pressed to the viewport and his tail wagging.\nThis time, Lester increased our speed slowly, allowing the alien craft to stay tantalizingly close (I loudly said too damned close) to us. As we approached the area where we had scattered the potatoes, Juan called out the speed and the distance.\n\"Ten-thousand miles, Les, mach 155.4. Prepare to perform a right angle maneuver in fifteen seconds.\"\nAt the count of fifteen, Lester grimaced as he pushed hard on the Nintendo control. The ship suddenly changed direction, at right angles to our original path. The magic of the ARTGRAV system meant that we weren't crushed to jelly, but my stomach had some ideas of its own for several minutes. Balthazer's eyes got really wide and he came over and curled up by my feet with his front paws covering his eyes. I patted him gently. In many ways we were in the same boat he and I - both of us were more or less along for the ride!\nThe alien ships swept through the area containing our frozen potatoes, with devastating results. There were three almost simultaneous flashes of very bright light, like little supernovas. Juan did some things at his Zeos keyboard.\n\"I'm reading nothing but debris, Les! By the virgin, it worked!\" All three of them got out of their seats and began whooping and hollering at the tops of their lungs. Lester danced a jig across the hood of the half-tractor. Finally, after about five minutes they began to settle down.\n\"What happened?\" I asked, bewildered by the whole thing as usual.\n\"You would not understand the math, Trevor,\" said Juan, breathlessly, \"but basically, our three friends flew into our cloud of frozen potato tubers.\"\n\"You mean the invincible Andromedans, who made a laughing stock out of Europe's finest forces were done in by three-hundred pounds - excuse me, one hundred and fifty kilograms - of POTATOES?!\"\n\"That's right, Dahlgren,\" grinned Lester, \"we done them in with three sacks of Idaho Russets!\" He began to dance another jig.\n\"Lester is essentially correct, Trevor, but if the alien ships had hit almost anything at the speeds they were traveling, they probably would have been destroyed.\"\n\"Huh? How can a potato destroy a spaceship?\"\n\"It has to do with high relative velocities, and the amounts of energy released when a collision occurs.\"\n\"I still don't follow.\"\n\"Let me try it another way. Out here in space, in a vacuum, in the absence of gravity, it is the relative motion that matters. Think of the alien ships as being at rest and the potato tubers moving at mach 150. You have seen what happens to an insect when it impacts your windshield out on the highway at seventy miles per hour?\"\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"Those grasshoppers do make quite a smack. I got hit on the arm once, when I was hanging it out the window. It hurt!\"\n\"A grasshopper at seventy miles per hour is moving at approximately 100 feet per second. It packs quite a wallop.\"\nI nodded my head in understanding.\n\"Now imagine hitting a frozen potato at a speed exceeding thirty MILES per second!\"\nIt began to dawn on me, but Juan wasn't done yet.\n\"You ever been to meteor crater, in Arizona?\"\n\"No, but I saw it on TV a couple of times.\"\n\"That's good,\" said Juan. \"The authorities believe that meteor crater was blasted out by a meteorite that wasn't much bigger than one of our potatoes, traveling at similar speeds to the ones we've been dealing with here.\"\n\"It was almost like an atomic bomb!\" I exclaimed.\n\"Exactly!\" said Juan. \"But there's more. I believe the aliens failed to detect and avoid the potatoes because they were ORGANIC MATTER, in an area where such things very seldom occur. Whether you knew it or not, Les, the use of potatoes for this purpose truly was a brilliant idea!\"\n\"Why thank ye, Juan.\"\n\"I tol' you, Mr. Trevor, thet my Lester was gonna save the world!\" Dorothy stood up on tiptoe and kissed her husband on the cheek which caused him to blush ferociously.\n\"Well, we have a good start, but there is the matter of the base on the far side of the moon to contend with,\" said Juan.\n\"Yer right, Juan, I got another idee we can try but firs' we gotta find out jus' what this ol' ship'll do!\"\n\"You mean ...\" Juan gulped.\n\"Thet's right, Juan, we gotta try her in road gear!\"\nJuan looked at Lester gravely for a few moments, considering.\n\"I am afraid you are right, my friend. Alright, take your places everyone. We are about to boldly go where no man has gone before!\"\nEven Dorothy looked at him suspiciously.\nWe went back to our accustomed positions and awaited the next development. I patted Balthazer as much to reassure myself as I did to comfort him.\nLester cracked his knuckles and shifted in his seat to get settled before he looked around at us and reached for the shift lever.\n\"You folks ready?\"\nWe all nodded, but nobody looked real happy. I didn't really know if what he was about to try was dangerous or not, I had just picked up on the mood of the rest of them. As nonchalant as they had been about some of our other activities that day, their being worried about this was enough to get my attention!\nLester pushed in the clutch. There was a soft clash of gears as he pulled the shift lever back into high gear.\n\"Here goes nothin',\" he announced as he let out the clutch and pulled back on the throttle.\nThese actions were followed by the strangest sensation that I have ever experienced. I'm not even sure I can explain it properly but it affected every one of the senses in a big way. Imagine a kaleidoscope made up of sensations, visual, aural and tactile, from all the carnival rides you've ever been on, kinda rolled together into a high-speed dream sequence and you'll have a rough idea of what it was like!\nI don't know what would have happened without the ARTGRAV. Balthazer lay on his side, eyes glazed and legs twitching. If his experience was anything like mine, he had just treed the cat of his dreams and was flying up after it!\nWhen Lester had let out the clutch, the sun was shining brightly through one of the port side viewports. After what seemed like only 30 seconds or so, the sun had all but vanished.\nIn its place was a small circle of bright light about the size of a pencil eraser. Juan, fingers flying over his keyboard, was the first to react.\n\"By the virgin! We have broken the light speed barrier! Lester, we have travelled nearly eighty light minutes out from the sun in under a minute!\"\nLester was wearing what could only be described as a shiteating grin.\n\"Yep,\" he said. \"Now we're gonna kick some alien ass!\"\n\"So we broke the light speed barrier,\" I said, \"That's great, but how will it help us stop the aliens?\"\n\"No sweat,\" said Lester. \"We just need to aim the ship at the alien base and let our potatoes do the rest.\"\nI shook my head, whatever they were about to do, I'd go along with. After all, we should have been dead several times already!\n\"This is gonna take some pretty hell-afied pilotin',\" said Lester. \"We gotta line everythin' up jus' right. An' I think we'd better use all three sacks of potatoes that we got left.\"\nWe got back into our seats and Lester did several more light-speed, carnivalmontage maneuvers to line the ship up properly with the moon. Juan, holding tightly to a iron pipe railing, called out directions from the eyepiece of a large, battered, but apparently still serviceable, refractor telescope that they'd wheeled over and trained through one of the viewports. Finally, they were both satisfied with the alignment.\n\"The alien base is centered in the field of view, Lester.\"\n\"Good! Now get them spuds outside.\"\n\"Right,\" said Juan. \"Come on, Trevor, we must get back into our spacesuits.\"\nThis time we left the bags intact, full of potatoes. We just nudged them gently out of the airlock where they tumbled gently, describing black, potato-sack-shaped silhouettes against the billions of tiny, brilliant, pinprick lights of the stars. An eerie feeling came over me at that moment. It was like I was trapped in a bad \"B\" movie, \"The Burlap Avengers of Sol Prime\" or something. That's it, I thought, I'll be waking up any minute!\nI didn't wake up and we came back inside.\n\"Okay, Juan, grab aholt of `em,\" said Lester.\nJuan manipulated some switches on his console. \"I have them in tow, Lester.\" As usual, I didn't know what they were talking about.\n\"What do you mean, you have them in tow?\"\n\"Tractor beam,\" said Lester.\nPowered by John Deere. How appropriate.\n\"Holt on, folks. We're goin' in!\"\nHigh gear again. The earth's moon started out as an insignificant point of light in the front (top) viewports. Over and above the carnival sensations, I watched it grow to an alarming size before Lester called out, \"Now!\" and turned the ship aside just as Juan flicked off the tractor beam. The moon flashed past the viewport.\nThe back side of the moon lit up in a brilliant blue flash that was many times brighter than the sun!\n\"Yee-haa!\" shouted Lester, taking the tractor out of gear and coming down to embrace his wife. Juan was crossing himself repeatedly as he grinned from ear to ear. The mood could only be described as joyous. I sensed that something good had just occurred but, you guessed it, didn't quite comprehend exactly what it was.\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\n\"One of our potato sacks scored a direct hit on the alien base, Trevor! We have saved Mankind!\"\n\"With a sack of potatoes?\"\n\"Remember our lecture on the meteor crater, Trevor?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, that sack of potatoes was travelling at greater than light speed when we let go of it. The amount of energy released was incalculable! The aliens didn't have a chance!\"\nWe arrived back in Washington to a hero's welcome. Within a few days, we had dinner with the President and the First Lady. There followed a tour of Europe and the rest of the world to meet with various heads of state. Not only did I attend them all, I got to cover them for the major wire services as well! My fame and fortune as a newsman soared meteorically, if I can use that expression! Perhaps you've read my book \"The Agricultural Revolution\" which gives an account of our adventure. \"Balthazer, Dog of Space\" has outsold \"Millie\" and, my latest, \"Plowshares into Swords: the Lester McGill Story,\" will be out in a month or so.\nSo you want to be a journalist? Okay, fine, but you gotta go where the news is happening, to where the future of mankind is being forged! And where might that be? Hey, no contest. You gotta become an agricultural reporter! Go for it! Last I heard, there was even an opening at the `Eastern Idaho Sentinel.'\nPhil is the Extension Seed Potato Specialist for the University of Idaho.

Relief flooded across her. She had not been sure that she could even get here.\nThe darkness was not complete. Occasionally, sharp lines of blood-red brilliance pierced it, sometimes straight and stretching forever from side to side, more often spiraling away toward some goal that could be seen only as a terminal dot of star-like white. Such apparitions appeared momentarily, and then were gone. Hours passed as Lirian floated among them and slept.\nShe awoke later feeling better, ready for the journey to end. She called out with her mind, and one of the spiraling red passages appeared before her. Unlike the others, she concentrated on this one, and it grew until it encompassed her. As she passed down it she wondered, as she always did, if she was spinning. The spiral made it appear so, but without reference points there was no certain way to tell.\nThe white star at the terminus of the spiral grew, faster and faster until it became her entire universe, and she passed through into the light. The magical gateway closed tightly behind her.\nA brilliant sun shone warmly on her face. At last, she stood on the parched desert of Game. Memories of this place flooded back to her from her days at the School. She remembered the battles fought here for the great trophies, and the other, illicit ones that were played out after hours. The School must have known that its students came here at night, but at the time it had seemed a great adventure. Especially, she remembered the time when she had come to Game, and found that not apprentices, but full-fledged masters were her opponents.\nShe had almost won that time, surprising herself, and was even more surprised when the single wizard who had beaten her showed up at the School to talk to her.\n``You show a great deal of talent,'' he had said. ``No apprentice has ever done so well before in Game with masters.''\nShe had been proud; even more so when the wizard made her his apprentice. It was an honor that she should have been years from achieving, but the School acknowledged her feat and gave its blessing. She stayed with Rosomar for many years, and learned the perfection of her art from him. The training had been hard, but after the first few months he was no longer so much a teacher to her as a friend. Her magical ability expanded faster than it ever had before. In the end, perhaps, she was a greater wizard than he was, but he was experienced where she was not, and at the end of her apprenticeship she had listened closely to his words.\n``For all mages of great power there comes a time when their power fades. Once simple spells become complex and difficult; even when you are sure that the motions are right, the magic will inexplicably fail. This is a dangerous time, for most mages who reach it forever lose their power. But when it happens to you, as it did to me, remember this: retreat to places and situations familiar to you. Do not give up, and always remain confident that your abilities will return. If they do not, you are unsuited for any other occupations-- it has taken you too long to learn magic. But if they do, you will be more powerful than you have been before, a master among masters.''\nFor seven years in the wars, she remembered the words, and planned, even as she became one of the most feared combat mages of her day. When at last her spells had begun to fail her, Lirian sought the place most comfortable to her, the place of childhood memories. She returned to Game.\nGame was a tiny world, watched closely by whatever gods there were that still dealt in men's affairs. Game overlapped upon itself, for a mage could walk in a straight line and return to his starting point in about four hours. Spaced in a circle, about four miles apart, were seven stone towers, each three stories high. The uppermost floor of each held food and water for the participants. Traditionally called citadels, the first seven mages to arrive in Game appeared in them, one mage to each tower.\nBetween the towers were small tufts of various terrains, including hills, forests, and deserts. The eighth mage arrived in the middle of the circle, in a small desert. The eighth and final player was in the worst position of them all, for he had neither the food nor protection of the towers. Usually, this mage had to make the first move, as the others waited calmly in their citadels.\nThe rules were simple. The last mage on Game won. Injury was impossible, but the gods watched closely. Any action that would have resulted in death to a player caused that mage to vanish from Game, otherwise unharmed. It was thus a perfect place for apprentices to try out potentially lethal spells in attack situations, without fearing for their own lives.\nIt was also, Lirian hoped, the perfect place for her to regain her spells. She looked around and saw only desert and the surrounding hills. I am the eighth, she thought. It depressed her for a moment, until she remembered that she was not here to win, only to play. In fact, the challenge would probably help.\nShe set out across the desert, which quickly gave way to hills hiding the citadels from view. Lirian knew the way, however, and within an hour she lay flat on her stomach at the top of a small hill, looking down on a stone tower.\nThe structure was not impressive, about fifteen feet in diameter and maybe thirty high. Most of its interior space was taken up by the spiral staircase that ran steeply up the inside. However, it was a place of both concealment and protection for a mage inside, and its magically supplied food and water made it invaluable if a game took a long time. Sometimes, a game took weeks, but more often only a few hours determined a winner-- in these cases, the food was of minimal importance.\nShe waited, and within a few minutes a man appeared at the top of the tower, scanning the horizon in all directions. She had not entered an apprentice's game; his robes were the deep blue of a full wizard.\nSliding down to insure that she was not in his view, she pulled a fallen branch toward her and began to work. Quickly, she stripped the bark from in with a small knife, and pulled off some splinters for use later. Then she quietly spoke a few words, made the requisite gestures, and passed her hands rapidly over the limb.\nNothing happened, and she cursed silently to herself. Her power was ebbing even here. A few days ago, she had practiced this spell, and it had worked perfectly. Forcing patience, she began again. This time, the spell triggered, and the limb stretched and bent, curving into the familiar shape of a longbow. Not letting the spell die, she reformed the splinters she had saved earlier until she had a small pile of arrows. A bowstring from the same pouch that had produced the knife finished the weapon, and she lifted it to her shoulder and pulled herself over the hilltop again.\nHidden by a bush, she nocked an arrow and waited. Most people in her profession avoided the use of physical weapons, but Lirian had practiced the bow for years, knowing that her spells would one day fail her. The training would now pay off.\nEventually, the man reappeared. Lifting herself slightly, she took careful aim. She trusted her archery skills more than she trusted her magical ones, but she wasn't going to give the unfamiliar mage warning by missing. When he stopped to survey his surroundings, she drew back the bowstring and fired.\nThe arrow struck her opponent full in the throat, and he clutched fiercely at it for a few seconds before toppling from the citadel to the ground. Lirian, a lifelong veteran of combat, did not feel any pity for him, only relief that she had overcome this first obstacle. It was only when she had to step over the body of the mage that it struck her that he was really dead. Frowning, she dragged the body with her into the citadel, then checked him over carefully. This was no illusion-- the mage was real, and he was dead. The blood still trickling from his neck was red, warm, and human.\nLirian pulled the knife from her pouch, and ran it across her palm. She felt pain, and a thin red line of blood confirmed the injury. She was no more protected than the other mage had been. Death should have been impossible on Game. The rules had changed, and a man had died because he didn't know. Lirian suddenly felt very afraid; only chance had taken him instead of her. Slowly, carefully, she attempted to cast the spell that would pull her from Game to another world, but it failed pitifully, and she knew that she didn't have the strength to keep trying the difficult incantation.\nLeaving the body, she climbed to the top of the tower and looked out. She saw no one, but she knew that was meaningless. Still, her anxiety subsided slightly. She looked around, and saw the expected casks of water and chests of preserved meats and breads. Putting aside her fears for a few minutes, she ate and drank; she might have to stay here a long time.\nWhen she had finished, she slung the bow over her shoulders, took some water and jerky, and left the tower at a slow walk, constantly looking from side to side. Her combat reflexes were back, and she was very aware that her life was in danger. Unconsciously, her feet began to step more carefully, and the sound of her movement died to a whisper. It took her almost three hours to cover the four miles to the next tower, but when she reached it she was sure that no one was following or watching her.\nThe citadel was apparently deserted, but she approached carefully. She considered cloaking herself in an invisibility spell, but the power drain if the spell failed might alert others to her presence like a beacon. So she crept forward silent and unseen by human means, and came to the base of the tower unharmed. Slipping inside, she immediately saw why.\nA sorceress lay at the bottom of the stairs, so badly burned that her sex was distinguishable only by the bent four-pointed emblem that she wore. The rest of the room was scorched as well, but the damage ended in a sharp line on the stairs as they approached the next level. If she had had any doubts previously, the line dispelled them; the fire had not been natural.\nLirian instantly became cautious again. There was no sign that the wizard who had caused this was still around, but the fire would have destroyed most of the easily read traces. Chancing a spell, she tried to cast out with her mind, seeking another living being. The power would not flow; she gave up the effort with an inaudible sigh. Her spells were less reliable now than they had been even a few days ago.\nShe took the stairs to the top floor of the tower, and cautiously peered over. About a mile away, she saw a man walking in the direction of a tower she had not yet visited. His pace was slow, and he seemed old or crippled, though he had proven himself to be a threat. Descending the staircase again, Lirian set off in quiet pursuit.\nLirian had been on Game dozens of times, for hundreds of hours. In all that time, it had always been hot and sunny. Now, however, dark clouds were gathering and building into thunderheads. In a few minutes, the sun was blocked and Game was cool. The occasional sound of thunder grew gradually, and helped hide the sound of her passage.\nWithin forty minutes she had the man in sight. Carefully keeping her self out of view, she approached. His robes were bedraggled, and he walked with a stoop as if he were ill. Once though, he turned his head to look into the forest, and Lirian got a good look at his face-- a face she recognized.\n``Rosomar!'' she shouted, and the old man turned back to look at her. Recognition stirred in his face, the stoop disappeared. ``Lirian!''\nThe two mages closed the distance between each other, and Rosomar gave her a gentle hug. His face became years younger, but whether it was an illusion that he now wore, or one which he had dropped, Lirian did not know. The younger face became serious.\n``You know that people can die now on Game?'' He looked at her, his eyes showing the same confusion hers had held.\n``Yes,'' she said softly. ``I killed a man earlier.''\n``I have killed as well. For real. It is the first time.'' Lirian remembered her first kill. It had not been easy for her, either. Rosomar had never been a combat mage-- his skills had always been used in teaching and tricks. The wars held no glory for him; he saw every slain man or woman as a potential apprentice wasted.\n``So what do we do?'' she said, not really changing the subject.\n``We leave Game as soon as possible. It's too dangerous to be here, especially if not everyone knows they can be killed. Some might enjoy the challenge anyway.''\nMost of them would, Lirian thought, but she did not say it. Instead: ``Take me with you. My magic isn't good enough right now to remove a toad from Game, much less myself.'' Rosomar looked her over carefully. ``So it has happened to you at last. Don't despair. It might come back.''\nThey were not exactly the words she wanted to hear, but Rosomar managed to make them sound comforting. He lifted his arms to the sky, brought them down, and began a soft chant. The words were melodious, and full of power. Even Lirian's diminished powersense could feel the energy flowing from his spell. The soft enfolding darkness fell about them-- and shattered.\nThe look of surprise on Rosomar's face made the slight jolt worthwhile, but Lirian didn't understand, and told him so.\n``We can't leave,'' he said unsteadilly. ``They won't let us.''\n``They?'' she asked.\n``I don't know. The gods, probably. Maybe just a powerful mage. Something is keeping us here.''\n``Then we're trapped?'' There was an edge of fear to her voice. Her absolute faith in Rosomar's power had been shattered with his spell, and with it went her confidence.\n``Quite probably. At least for the time being.'' He paused, considering. ``We should find the others and warn them of their danger.'' He spoke uncertainly, as if he wanted her to disagree.\nShe didn't. There was nowhere else for her to go. They might as well attempt some good while they were here. Together, they set off for the next tower.\nA few heavy drops of rain fell, then stopped, then the storm was upon them. Lirian succeeded in putting up a simple spell to keep the rain off them, but even so, their footing was unsure. Within minutes, vision had dropped to a few feet, and the two mages crawled along at a snail's pace. After three hours, Rosomar stopped.\n``We may have missed the citadel in the rain. Maybe we should stay here until it lets up.''\nRosomar dried out a small area, and Lirian extended her spell over it. The two of them lay down and waited for the storm to end.\nThe heavy rain was a featureless grey, and although the water would not run through their protected zone, it washed and splashed against the non-physical wall they had erected, leaving drops and rivulets in the air, muddy streams carrying sand and leaves on the ground. The sound drowned out all attempts at conversation between the two mages. Once, a tree fell and they had to move their haven a few feet further away. From time to time lightning filled the sky, and they could see the forest around them, and the thousands of raindrops, frozen in the air for a moment by the sudden light.\nIt took almost four hours for the rain to let up enough to allow travel. Rosomar and Lirian slept lightly for a time, then rose and started moving again. Soon it was dry enough that Lirian could recognize their position, and a few minutes travel brought them in sight of the next tower.\nA blast of flame from the top of the citadel told them that it was still occupied. Rosomar shouted loudly ``Stop that! We need to talk! You are not protected!''\nThe flame did not return, and the two mages approached. A woman appeared on the top of the tower, hands at her side, waiting. Not until they had covered half the distance to the citadel did she move. Both mages saw the motion begin, and began protective spells, but Rosomar's went up a split second too late. He spun in wild pain for a few seconds before the flames consumed him completely.\nLirian screamed a curse that would have gotten her expelled from the School, but it was not as strong as the anger she felt. ``He came to talk, and you killed him!'' She was angry and grief-stricken, but not stupid enough to let her own defense down. When the second blast struck her, she felt the protective spell weaken, and knew it couldn't survive another. Quickly, while the flames still gave her cover, she fitted an arrow to her bow and let it fly.\nThe wet bowstring caused the arrow to stray from its mark, but not by enough to save the sorceress in the tower. She took the arrow in her left arm, destroying the spell she had just begun, and Lirian's second struck true. The woman crumpled.\nLirian turned to examine Rosomar; only charred ashes remained. The rain was washing these away as well. Choking, she said a brief eulogy for him, then climbed the tower.\nThe sorceress was still alive, though barely so. Certainly she was no longer capable of casting spells, and carried no visible weapons. Lirian knelt at her side when she began to speak.\n``I had to do it, you know. He won't let us leave until only one is left. I tried to kill you, and failed. But I saved you the pain of killing your companion yourself.''\n``He?'' Lirian asked, ignoring the rest of the woman's statement. ``Who won't let us leave?''\n``You don't know, then? I'll tell you. Maybe you can escape. I didn't have the power. Gruenfeld is here. He is one of the participants.''\nLirian's half-forgotten fear returned. ``Gruenfeld? The god? He's here on Game?''\nThe sorceress looked directly at her. ``Gruenfeld is here. There are no gods, though, just a man who has learned the limits of his power. But he is greater than either of us. He cannot be killed, and absolutely controls the weather of Game. He forbids us from leaving, and watches us kill one another for his own amusement. He can be the only winner of this game.''\nLirian's anger had abated considerably. ``Then I won't play by his rules, will I?'' The question was more to herself than the sorceress, but the wounded woman smiled anyhow. Lirian pulled the arrow from her arm and began a healing spell. It failed twice, but she kept trying, and eventually the blood flow stopped. The sorceress's other wound presented less difficulty.\n``It will take a while before you can cast spells again,'' Lirian commented. ``There's food and water here. When you can, heal yourself, but don't come after me.'' She didn't add what she was thinking. I'll be dead by then anyway.\nLirian descended the tower without looking back. She was not at all sure that the sorceress would live, and even less sure that she cared. Placing her bow over her shoulder, she set off toward the next citadel, already knowing what she would find there.\nShe was not disappointed. As she came over a small hill, she saw the tower lying in ruins, the bodies of two men lying in the rubble. That makes seven, she thought. And Gruenfeld is eight. All the players have made their moves. A few seconds later, the god himself strode around the tower.\n``Come on down!'' he shouted. ``No point in prolonging this game any longer than we have to, is there?'' His voice was firm and sure, and he looked directly at her as he spoke. The voice carried power, and she took a step toward him before breaking the spell. Then she dropped and rolled.\nThe blast she had expected did not come. Gruenfeld laughed loudly, with a touch of malice. Lirian knocked an arrow and fired, and had the next one on the bow before the first had traveled half the distance to the god.\nGruenfeld brought his arm up in a single gesture of defiance, and both arrows vanished, followed by the bow. ``No,'' he said. ``I do not choose to die today.'' His next gesture almost caught Lirian by surprise, but at the last second she brought up a protective spell and leapt to the side. The spell failed, but she was far enough away when the flames struck that she received only minor burns.\nThe god was undaunted. ``Very impressive spell you cast,'' he mocked. ``Could you show me how to do it some time?'' Suddenly, he took Lirian's blast full in the chest. She relaxed slightly, then screamed in pain as a hail of small sharp spikes went through her left leg.\n``Silly apprentice,'' the god said calmly. ``Do you think such as me would even notice your small effort? You do not know much of gods. I shall endeavor to teach you.'' He brought his hands up, again and again, and Lirian found herself unable to do anything but dodge and try to defend. Her spells failed her altogether, and she could not walk on her leg. Eventually, she fell and could not get up. The god vanished, and appeared behind her.\n``This game has gone on long enough. I declare myself the winner.'' He moved his hands like lightning; Lirian could hardly have moved in time if she had been uninjured. Fire and pain became her world. Darkness descended, but it was broken by thoughts and tiny spots of light.\nA god is nothing but a man who knows the limits of his power. Lirian knew her own limits. They had been set by the rules of the sorcery she practiced, reinforced by the instruction of her teacher. Knows the limits of his own power. The rules of magic could not change. Gruenfeld's power could not exist; all the laws of power forbade it. Then why have I lost my spells?\nShe knew. With a sudden absolute certainty, she knew where her power had gone. She had learned magic until she thought she had reached its limits. Any more would be impossible, too powerful, forbidden by the rules of the game. But the rules were wrong. Since Gruenfeld existed, the power must exist. Rosomar had given her a hint of it, once: If your magic comes back, you will be a more powerful mage than ever before. But Rosomar hadn't known. He had merely allowed a slight increase in ability by altering his rules.\nLirian eliminated hers.\nIn the half of a second that it had taken for realization to come, Gruenfeld's magic had destroyed most of her body. She had no arms, no legs, nothing with which to cast spells. It didn't matter. The magic flowed free, power coursing through her mind like water through a broken dam. Her body repaired itself, and she gathered and magnified Gruenfeld's fire, turning it back upon the unsuspecting god. In a moment he was just a man, if he had ever been anything else. His power was enormous, but his mind could not conceive of another living being matching it. Unready for a response, Gruenfeld did not even try to defend against her. In another moment, he ceased to exist.\nGame shook with Lirian's magic as she brought it back under control, and she finally realized her full power. Everything lay bare to her, every tree and citadel on Game, as well as the other worlds which lay outside. Reaching out with her mind, she located the sorceress on the tower, and healed her completely. There was no reason for hostility any longer-- Rosomar was dead beyond even Lirian's ability to bring him back; the sorceress still had a chance at life. ``Go home,'' Lirian whispered kindly, and knew that the sorceress heard her across the distance. ``Gruenfeld is dead.''\nThen she turned her mind to Game. At her whim, a soft white snow began to fall, covering the carnage of the last few hours. It would take a lot of work to restore Game to what it had been.\nLirian knew that she could do it. Restoring worlds was, after all, the work of a goddess.\nChristopher Kempke is a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University.

Among the ideas which were implemented by the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission was the Columbus 500 Space Sail Cup. Spacecraft are to launch on conventional chemical rockets around Columbus day of 1992 and have to go to Mars using only light pressure. Among the serious competitors are the Canadian Solar Sail Project, the Aeritalia Team from Italy, Cambridge Consultants from Great Britain, and the World Space Foundation from the United States. There are also teams from Japan, Israel, and the Soviet Union, though the status of those projects is less clear. There are numerous criteria for winning, such as shortest transit to Mars orbit and the closest approach to the planet. In order to be recognized as a winner the sail must receive no government funding, but may receive money from the Columbus Commission. The Commission is subsidizing the efforts of three ships to match the three ships Columbus took to the new world (there was a fourth, but it had to turn back). One team from each of the Americas, Europe, and Asia, will receive whatever money becomes available. The World Space Foundation sail is the official Americas sail, and will receive some of the money, if it ever is granted in the budget.\nOne way of looking at the mass-energy equivalence expressed in Einstein's famous equation, E = m * c^2, is that any time energy moves from one place to another, it behaves in part as if mass is moving that way. If a mass is moving into another body, it pushes on it. The same is true of light. The momentum flux associated with light is very low, equal to the power flux divided by the speed of light. At Earth orbit, above the atmosphere, the solar power flux is roughly 1400 kilowatts per square metre. This corresponds to a momentum flux of 4.7 micronewtons per square metre. If a square metre of a perfectly absorbing material is put in direct sunlight above the atmosphere, and the light hits it perpendicularly to the surface, it feels a force of 4.7 micronewtons, or roughly one two thousandth of the weight of a paper clip at the Earth's surface. A perfectly reflecting material would feel double that force. Compare this to the three space shuttle main engines (SSMEs), each of which generates 1.67 meganewtons of thrust at sea level, and 2.1 meganewtons of thrust in vacuum. Even a 100,000 square metre sail would not generate a millionth the thrust of a single SSME, though it would be a square as long on edge as three football fields.\nSolar sailing will almost certainly never be used as a ground launcher, though a variant, a laser launcher, could be constructed in the next five or ten years. Solar sailing becomes attractive as a means of thrust on long voyages through interplanetary space. The three space shuttle main engines and the two solid rocket boosters together provide, very roughly, 8 km\/second of delta-velocity before they burn out after 8.5 minutes. A shuttle which masses 2 million kilograms on the pad delivers itself and cargo, about a hundred thousand kilograms in total, to orbit. 95% of the mass goes out as rocket exhaust gas, or is dropped into the sea in the form of spent boosters and empty external tank. Compare this to a solar sail. The propellant is sunshine, there is no fuel, and the thrust is continuous. The spacecraft does not have to be made to be 95% fuel by mass. While it might be fifty percent or more sail by mass, that material is not expended. A sail can be reused, or the material melted down for use at the destination. If a rocket were used in a round trip to Mars, and it had to carry its fuel for the return journey, it would have to be huge at launch. If the fuel for the engines massed 9 times as much as the payload, which must include the fuel for the return trip, then the initial mass of the rocket would be 99% fuel.\nIt might seem at first that the optimal configuration for a solar sail is one in which the light hits the sail at normal incidence (perpendicular to the surface). This doesn't turn out to be the case, though. A sail oriented this way exerts all its thrust along the line away from the sun. Because the intensity of the light from the sun falls off as the square of the distance, the magnitude of this outward thrust must fall off also as the square of the distance. In this way it is exactly like gravity. In fact, putting the sail at normal incidence to the sun has the same effect as would have reducing the mass of the sun. It places the sail into an elliptical orbit which moves farther away from the sun for a while, but must return to its starting point after one complete revolution about the sun. This is not a particularly useful configuration. The only way to avoid this with a sail at normal incidence is for the solar pressure to exceed the force of gravity, so that the sail goes into a hyperbolic escape from the solar system. In order to do this, for the power output and mass of our sun, the sail would have to mass no more than one kilogram for every 600 square metres of sail area, including the mass of payload and electronics. This is not practical for ground-based construction. The sail material for the Canadian Solar Sail Project will mass about a kilogram per hundred square metres, before putting on structure or electronics.\nSo, putting the sail at normal incidence to the sun is not the best configuration. It is better to angle the sail in such a way as to maximize the component of the thrust which is parallel to the direction of travel. This turns out to be when the angle between the sun and the perpendicular to the sail is about 35.3 degrees. In this configuration the spacecraft is being pushed along the direction of travel, and so it climbs the gravity well. In the counter-intuitive realm of orbital mechanics, the spacecraft slows down the whole time it is climbing the well.\nWell, if the only important thing is the component of the thrust along the velocity vector, it can clearly be aligned the other way to oppose the velocity vector. This pushes against the direction of travel, dropping the sail down the gravity well, causing it to speed up the whole time. A solar sail, contrary to popular belief, can travel sunward just as easily as it can travel anti-sunward.\nThe travel time to Mars for a solar sail is a strong function of the mass to area ratio. It is not unreasonable to manufacture a solar sail which can be launched in the next two years to arrive at Mars in about another two years. It has been suggested that solar sail spacecraft could be used to send provisions and equipment to Mars ahead of a manned expedition. This two year time is not a fundamental limitation of solar sails, but is quite good for sailcraft launched from the ground.\nIf a solar sailcraft is to be launched from the ground and unfolded in space, the sail must be strong enough to withstand the stresses involved. For the solar sailcraft running in the race to Mars in 1992, the sails will be made of a strong polymer coated with aluminum for reflectivity. Once the sail is launched and unfolded, the polymer is just dead weight which has to be dragged to the destination by the sailcraft. It would be convenient if the substrate could be chosen to evaporate in the environment of space, for instance if the polymer breaks down in ultraviolet light, thus lightening the sail, and this possibility has been investigated by several teams.\nIn the future, solar sails might be manufactured and deployed in space, allowing square kilometres of very thin aluminum to be tethered to a cargo or passenger module. These sails could make an Earth-Mars transit in less time than a Hohmann transfer orbit. It has been speculated in science fiction that a solar sail would make an excellent asteroid surveyor, as it would have essentially an unlimited fuel supply.\nSolar sails were seriously studied by NASA in the 1960s as possible manned transportation around the solar system. In those days of optimism serious plans were formed for lunar bases by 1975, nuclear launchers and interplanetary engines, and unmanned interstellar probes. None of these ever received serious funding, and they all died on the drawing boards and test beds by the early 1970s. Now, twenty years later, we will finally, to quote Arthur C. Clarke, `sail the wind from the Sun'.\nShuttle Statistics taken from _The Space Transportation Systems Reference_ edited by Christopher Coggon, ISBN 0-920487-00-9\nChristopher Neufeld is a physics Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto and a team member on the Canadian Solar Sail Project, which is an initiative of the Canadian Space Society.

It was hard work back in those days. The universe was structured very differently than it is today. I mean, there was this stuff back then, matter, just as there is the same stuff, matter, today. But what matter did in those days (they seemed to last forever) was quite different from what it does today. Now, there is what is called entropy. Order will become chaos. Disorder and randomness will creep into structured systems. For example, if you place a drop of ink into a glass of water, soon the ink will become dispersed throughout the entire glass. The system has changed from order (all the ink concentrated into one spot) to chaos, (the ink spread out in the water). This is just what you would expect to happen nowadays, but back then it was different. Entropy worked backwards at one time. This might seem strange or even inconceivable to someone who has only witnessed the universe as it is today, but it is true. Trust me, I was there. Particles scattered throughout a box (of course, we had no boxes) would aggregate into a corner. Order and structure would creep into complete chaos. Molecules and crystalline shapes would appear out of nowhere where before there was only a kinetic blur of free particles. You might doubt that this was ever the case, but consider how things must have been in the beginning.*1* In the beginning there was no order. There was no such thing. Recognizable shapes? Ridiculous, we would have said (perhaps as even now you are uttering the same word). All we knew were the particles flying about with nothing else to do. Protons, electrons, mesons, Z bosons (all four kinds), the happy photons, and the mournful gluons. Not to mention the peons, the zions, the neutrinos, the supremos. We had more particles flying about than we knew what to do with. Order would have been a very strange concept if any of us had thought of it then.\nThere were seven of us back then: myself, Ouphe, Tholus, Pyxidis, Yerba, Nanos, and the strange one, Reis. At first there was not much to do. We somehow discovered the sublime joys of counting, for there was nothing else we could think of doing, and we counted ourselves. We were quite amused to find that this number did not change after repeated summations. Or I should say that the number calculated by each of the two respective fractions of counters did not vary. There were those of us, myself and my followers, Tholus and Pyxidis, who thought that the counter, that is, the one doing the counting, should be included in the summation, and the other group, Ouphe and his cohorts, Yerba and Nanos, who emphatically insisted that the counter should be left out. The number we counted was seven, and the number they counted was six. This problem occupied us for a while, as only one of the two answers could be correct. There were either six or seven of us. It could not be both; then there would be thirteen of us, and nobody had counted that yet, so we couldn't seriously consider it (although for a while it was a theory). This holds the honor of being the first intellectual argument, *3* although I can find no reference to it here on the the many shelves of Eckhart Library. Today we would have applied for government research grants to fund experiments and trips to key observational sites (Hawaii) and then written lengthy reports using such words as nystagimorphic integration, patronumismatical, and isoglophigraphicalism and sent them to prestigious academic journals. But as this was before the universe was ordered in any sense of the word, we could do none of these. Reis, who was different from the beginning, never got involved in these numerational disputes, and if he ever counted, he never revealed his answer to us. Hence, as we lacked a scientific quorum to decide the correct representation of reality, we remained disputatious and unpublished.\nWhen counting ourselves lost most of its appeal, we began to count other things. Those with keener senses of vision could count the number of electrons that passed them. The rest of us had to make due with counting slow moving neutrons or the magnetic monopoles that floated about. Reis wasn't interested in this either, and seemed only to care about watching various particle collisions, or pushing particles into magnetic fields and watching them spiral about. Counting monopoles wasn't as much fun as counting ourselves had been. For one thing, we were all counting different monopoles and couldn't really argue with others about these summations. There were no conflicting ideologies involved, no heated debates and brawls, no passion involved in this counting. But we could think of nothing else to do. *2*\nI was counting monopole 2,000,367 when it first happened. Next to my elbow a group of particles had suddenly collapsed into the shape of a large cube. Of course, we didn't call it a cube, as we had never seen one before. By large I mean about a couple of centimeters. This might not sound large to you, but up until that time we had only been dealing with subatomic particles, so small we could barely see them. The cube reflected photons in a strange way, producing shimmering, swirling patterns on its sides.\nThis event, the formation of the cube, took us all by surprise. Who could have expected it? It took us a while to figure out what had happened. We were sure that we hadn't been overlooking this object all this time. But that meant it was new. How did it form? What made it form here? As we were pondering these and other questions, another object, a tetraroid crystal, formed right before our eyes. Nanos, who had keen eyes, reported that he saw countless numbers of protons and electrons coming together to form this new shape.\nTo say the least, we were astounded by these developments. They were so different from what we had known before. We couldn't really ascertain the shapes of the particles around us, even to Nanos they looked just like points. And these new objects were so unlike our nebulous forms. They were so smooth, so perfect, so beautiful.\nWe didn't have to wait long before more forms appeared, mostly cubes, but also many other solids: hexaphonigons, fullerines, rhododendrigons. This became our primary source of entertainment, watching the objects form, or counting the different types of objects, or pushing like objects together into small spherical piles. This was more exciting and enjoyable than anything we had known before. The joy of seeing a new shape, one that had never been seen before, appear before one's eyes is a joy I cannot begin to describe. Although we were all greatly excited about the multitude of creation about us, it was Reis who was most fascinated by all of this. Never before had we seen him without an expression of bored indifference. Now, he was obsessed with observing all the newness around him.\nWe were all more than satisfied with our new surroundings. For once there was actually something to do. How could we have magined the danger that we were in? We didn't realize our predicament until it was almost too late for us to do anything. The shapes kept forming even when it was apparent that there were quite enough of them. By the time the shapes had blocked out about 75% of the outside universe from out view (not that there was anything to see, just a uniform glow of photons), things were getting very cramped where we were. It was still a small universe, about the size of Nebraska (but not as flat). It was clear that soon we would be crushed by all of the opalescent objects. When we first realized this, we thought that we could just push the objects away from us. But when we tried to do this, we found to our dismay that the shapes slowly drifted back towards us. All of the objects around us had created a rather sizeable gravitational field, and we were at it's center. We obviously did not have the strength to accelerate the objects to a sufficient escape velocity to rid ourselves of them, although we did try (to this day my arm is still sore). The gravitational field also prevented us from escaping to a volume where there were less crowded conditions.\nYou might wonder where our problem came from. There was plenty of room in the universe before the shapes began forming, why was there a problem now? We also wondered this for sometime. The shapes formed from subatomic particles, which were small, so if a million particles came together to form a rhumbahedron, it would be the size of a million particles, right? This is what we naively thought. After observing enough of these condensations, we were able to figure out exactly what happened. You would agree that a proton is very small, and an electron smaller still, just a speck! But when they come together to form an atom, the atom is much larger than either of the two constituent particles. Even though the volume inclosed by the atom is enough to contain about a million protons, it only contains one. This extra space is empty, as the electron is in an orbit far (by these standards) from the proton. Are you surprised that most of matter isn't? This was quite a strange discovery for us. The same thing happened with these crystalline shapes, except to a greater extent. So although there was basically the same amount of matter around us, it was now in a new form that occupied a much larger volume.\nThese new advances in our knowledge did little to comfort us in our present situation. We still had no way of dealing with our problem, which was now becoming desperate. We could see little of the outside universe, being incased in an ever growing shell of these objects. We had managed to push most of the crystals away from the seven of us, forming a small cavity for us to exist. Still more and more of the shapes formed around us. We were doomed.\nIt was in a fit of rage that I accidentally found the solution to our problems. We had had so little genuine intellectual exercise in our existence that those of you who have been paying attention probably thought of it long ago. I reached out and grabbed two cubes and smashed them together. They collided in a flash of photons and disassembled into their constituent protons and electrons, which were now free from their carngormatic prison.\nIf our problem was small particles coming together to form collections of particles that filled a larger volume than the sum of the original particles, surely the answer was to take apart the objects into their component forms.\nI had only to wordlessly demonstrate this to the others for them to catch onto the idea. They all began to reach for the nearest objects. All except for Reis. He seemed to be horrified at the idea of destroying the crystalline shapes. We had to prod him to get him to join in our efforts. Finally, he gave in and began to smash the things apart, although without much enthusiasm.\nAfter we all had begun breaking the solids, I felt sure that we were out of danger, but I had overlooked two facts. One; after we smashed a crystal, its component parts would fly off and condense into another shape. Two; there were so many of the shapes that we could barely keep up with destroying those newly formed, much less any of the multitude around us.\nExistence became for us a miserable experience, each moment spent smashing everything within reach. Five of us would be awake at any one time, leaving two to restless sleep, which we had never needed before, never having had to physically exert ourselves. The routine was awful; grab the nearest two crystals and smash them. Then the next two. And then the next two.\nI cannot tell you how long our misery went on (we had no clocks), but it seemed like an eternity. I can only tell you that we smashed hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of these shapes. How wretched we all were. It seemed like we were doomed to carry out this Sisyphantic task forever. We were now completely cut off from the outside universe, the crystals forming a dense shell around us, like an egg. And we, the helpless chicks that we were, were without hope.\nIt was by chance that I looked up from the two tetrahedrons that I was smashing to Reis, and what I saw horrified me. Instead of breaking the crystals apart, he was serenely putting them together, oblivious to the doom around him. He had stacked two cubes on top of a agonadron and had smeared a handful of mesons around it for cohesion. He was reaching for a rhombic dodecahedron when I rushed over and smacked him across the face. What was he trying to do, I yelled, let us all be crushed? I reached to smash his design, but he, being the wily sort that he was, snatched it out of my grasp and without a word went to the far end of our remaining space, behind a large wall of crystals where we could not see him. I instinctively started to follow him, but then I thought better of it. Why waste time trying to get him to work. If he wants to get crushed, let him. To survive, I would have to work.\nI woke up Yerba and Tholus and explained the situation to them as best as I could. There was not much that we could do. Tholus, being naturally violent, suggested that we get Reis and beat the crap out of him. It was the consensus of the others that this was a Good Thing To Do, but my cooler head prevailed and I convinced everyone to get back to work. We couldn't force Reis to survive, and already he was completely sealed off from us. We were sure that he was no longer alive, crushed by his own foolishness. Soon, I cautioned, a similar fate would befall us.\nWe were now in a panicked, feverish state. It seemed like there was no way for us to win. We were all exhausted, and there was even less space left for us to move around in. We knew the end was near when the seven of us, six of us, were forced back to back to back, each taking care of the shapes that coalesced right in front. We were sardines in a can. Modern Cosmologists will talk about The Big Crunch, but they have no idea how it feels to have the universe, the entire universe, to close in on them.\nJust when we thought that there was no use in trying, when we had given up all hope, when we had no more strength left to fight, when the shapes were forming in our very ears, something unexpected happened. The shapes that composed the wall in front of me began to to quiver. Soon a number of the crystals burst from the wall, forming quite a large hole. From this hole emerged...a...it was...what was it? If I had thought that the first cube that I saw looked weird, it was nothing compared to this. There were two arrays of cubes parallel to each other, each about about twelve by twelve cubes by one thick. The arrays were separated by about ten cube lengths. On the side facing me, there was a row of tetrahedrons, like teeth, attached to each array so that they faced forwards. On the farther side was a mass of shapes and particles which produced magnetic fields. These fields pushed the two arrays together, smashing what ever was in between them. Then the fields switched polarity and separated the arrays. The machine turned to my left and began crunching all of the myriad objects that formed the wall closest to us. It could crush a hundred objects during the time it took us to reach for two. The others had by now seen this, and had stopped to stare dumbfounded at this thing, this smasher. How could objects and particles come together so perfectly to form such a thing, a thing that seemed to have the sole purpose of saving us?\nThe answer was standing majestically behind it: Reis. He stood there observing his creation, making sure that it was functioning correctly. He placed a few monopoles in to a pion funnel in back (his smasher ran on monopoles). Then he turned without giving us so much as a glance and started to tinker with some particles. We did not care; we were saved. Already the smasher had smashed many of the objects and things were much less crowded. Soon we were able to see the universe outside of our prison. The smasher not only broke the objects apart, but it also gathered together the constituent particles, ejecting them behind it at a great velocity, so there would not be a high concentration of particles floating about. This change in mass distribution had an almost immediate effect on us. Now that the matter around us was being dispersed by the smasher, we were no longer trapped in a gravitational well. We began to drift apart, each of us going in a different direction. Of course, we could have struggled to remain together, but we did not have the strength left after our ordeal to do so. I began to go to sleep, and I could see the others doing the same. We did not even have the strength to wave goodbye to each other as we drifted apart. The last thing I remember seeing is Reis, trying to get an electron to orbit a proton as the smasher continued to destroy the last of the dreaded objects. He's mad, I thought, he'll never get such a wily and tenacious particle like an electron to stay bound to a proton. Then I lost consciousness.\nWhen I woke I was far from my companions; I could not even see them. How long had I been asleep? Quite a while, I guessed. The universe had greatly expanded in my slumber, and the uniform glow of photons was much dimmer than I had remembered it. There was really nothing around me. I was alone.\nI have not seen any of the other six since that time. I wonder where they are. I wonder if they watched with awe as I did at the formation of stars, galaxies, life, the Federal Money Reserve. How much I would like to see my former companions in these stale times. I would especially like to see Ouphe, and finally, now that we both know so much more about the world, point out to him that he was wrong and I right; the counter is included in the summation. He would look at me, after inticipating and dreading this moment for years, and say something along the lines of \"I always said that,\" or \"Why are you telling me?\" or even brazenly `Just like I told you when we were young.\" However, he would know that he was beaten, and that would be enough for me. With that matter settled, we would lean back in our armchairs, light up cigarettes, and wonder how much of the order that we see around us is due to Reis, the Creator.\nEndnotes:\n*1* I refer the Skeptical Reader to the article \"Antichaos and Adaptation\" by S. Kaufman (1991) for the basis of a theory which attempts to explain how complex nucleic acids formed on Earth by a process similar to what I am describing.\n*2* The concept of Why had not yet been invented, and hence many important metaphysical and philosophical diatribes were unavailable to us.\n*3* Although there exists evidence of great intellectual turmoil before the universe came into being.

There, he developed his writing style, which has been described as \"a male Aldous Huxley, but with more hair.\" Upon arrival to the University of Chicago, he realized he had not even begun to approach the heights of underacheiving. He began writing short stories, because the strict limitations of the format demanded discipline and only a couple sheets of paper. He writes stories with multiple endings, \"...to give the people a sense of controlling the environment that forms their dreams and way of thinking, and 'cuz I really liked those Choose-Your-Own-Way books.\" When not trying to get friends to write glowing assessments of his life, he keeps his electronic equipment in a state of constant repair, dreaming of having \"...a truly cool jam session with Jeff Beck, the true talent to come out of the Yardbirds.\"\n`The Second Law And I' is a tribute to the Italian writer Italo Calvino, who died in 1985 (a year after the death of Cortazar, and a year before the demise of Borges and Eliade).

A few other people noticed it in the next few minutes, and eventually one of them was curious enough to call the planetarium. After the phone call, things happened quickly.\nThe Arizona telescope was appropriated from its mechanical wanderings across the night sky, and carefully aimed at where a new point of light billowed in the heavens, near the southern horizon. Aaron Gregory was the first at the viewplate, and his soft whistle was enough to bring his collegues to silence. Years of experience allowed him to pull all the details he required in a moment, he was not long at the telescope. He said nothing as the rest of the men and women filed by. When they were done, they turned toward him almost as one, expectant. Gregory shrugged, lifted a coffeepot next to him, and poured himself a cup.\nThe pot was finished well before the meeting was.\n``Black holes don't explode.''\n``Of course not. We're all having a mass hallucination.''\n``Maybe something near the hole?''\n``It's the same distance away to the precision of our instruments, and there's no sign of pull on it at all. Nothing to indicate that there's a hole nearby.''\n``Check it with a radioscope?''\n``Too much interference from the explosion. But I could tell you what the results would be. There's no black hole there, only a supernova.''\nGregory cleared his throat, bringing silence to the room. ``So we know what happened. Anyone care to speculate how?''\nThe meeting dissolved in chaos once more.\nThe press the next morning had plenty of ideas. Most prevalent among them was that the unexplained phenomenon was a sign from God, regardless of its cause. The tabloids expounded on a number of other options, as well. The astronomers continued to be perplexed.\n``God moves in mysterious ways,'' one of the journalists suggested to Gregory at the fifth conference in as many hours. Gregory gave him a look that would melt glass.\n``God, my friend, has nothing to do with it. This is a strictly natural phenomenon.'' His voice carried the strain of many hours without sleep, and the distinct impression that he did not regard the journalist as his friend.\n``All natural phenomena are His work,'' said another voice. Gregory turned to face a priest. His face remained taut for a moment, then relaxed. ``Perhaps, yes. But that's not the explanation that I'm after.''\n``What more explanation do you need? There is, after all, a precedent. The night of our Saviour's birth, some two thousand years ago.''\n``Has been satisfactorily explained without recourse to a divine being. Are there any more questions of a _scientific_ nature?''\nAnother reporter raised his hand, and the conference stumbled on.\nThe first time Gregory got to relax was as his plane lifted into the air en route to London. He shuffled through the pages of numbers in front of him for a time, then gave up, put them down, and closed his eyes.\nIt was fully six hours when he awoke the garbled speech of the plane's intercom system.\n``We are experiencing some navigational difficulties. There is no danger involved, and no equipment vital to our safety has been damaged. However, this flight will be some hours longer than previously planned, and we may have to make an additional stop. Trans-Atlantic airlines and your flight crew apologize for the inconvenience. We will keep you posted on further developments. Arrangements are being made for those of you with connecting flights.''\nGregory smiled. He would miss his meeting, certain to cause consternation among his international associates. The thought filled him with some glee, for the invitation had stressed the urgency of the meeting in the typically British, overzealous way, and without the data he carried, they had nothing to discuss. They would just have to wait.\nHe gradually became aware that the man next to him was staring at him, a look of puzzlement on his face. Gregory turned.\n``You, or somebody that looks like you, were in the newspaper this morning.''\nGregory extended his hand. ``Aaron Gregory. I'm an astronomer, and yes, a charming image of me was all over the paper today.''\nThe man nodded sagely. ``I'm Raphael. Pleased to meet you.''\n``No last name?''\n``In my country, last names are generally considered secret. A bit of a quaint custom, but it's ingrained.''\nGregory nodded, trying to place Raphael's accent as he continued to speak.\n``You're the guy who discovered the supernova, aren't you?''\n``Not really `discovered.' I have done the most work on it, though.''\n``Why does this supernova get so much attention? The one ten years ago didn't even cause a stir.''\n``Mainly because we think a black hole exploded to form this one. All scientific rationale says that that's impossible. We're looking for a way of understanding how it happened, or, if it didn't, what did.''\n``And? What do you think?''\n``Personally? I'm not sure. We don't really know much about black holes. My suspicion is that we just had the theory wrong, and that explosions are possible. Bunches of my collegues, however, are spouting theories that energy is being `warped' in from other regions of space. That one just doesn't ring true to me. If it's possible, it should be happening all the time. Of course, I would once have said the whole thing was impossible.''\n``What if it is?''\n``Impossible? I don't understand; we saw it happen. In fact, it's bright enough to be seen in the daytime if you look in the right place. There's no doubt that it's there.''\n``But not everything has an explainable cause.''\n``No, but I have to attribute it to nature or God. And I'm quite a devout athiest.''\n``Yes, yes indeed you are. Funny how it works out that way, sometimes.'' Raphael's tone was enigmatic, and Gregory could not make sense of the statement. He was about to ask, but Raphael spoke first.\n``Excuse me a minute, but nature calls.'' He rose and walked toward the back of the plane. Suddenly tired, Gregory was asleep before Raphael returned.\nA jarring sensation woke him, and apparently a number of the other passengers as well. The plane lurched heavily to one side, scattering trays, books, and people. There were a few moments of stunned silence, then a voice on the intercom.\n``The plane has been crippled by some equipment failure. Unfortunately, this will require our making a forced landing. There is a desert below us which will offer safe landing areas. However, to minimize the risk of injury, we request that you all take crash positions. The flight attendents will review the procedure with you now. Please remain calm, the danger is slight. We will be landing in roughly ten minutes.''\n``Desert?'' The voice, from the man in front of Gregory, was breaking. ``There are no deserts in Europe. We're all going to die!''\n``Look out your window,'' Gregory said. ``If that's somebody's flower garden, I think they need to water it more often. Obviously we're not over Europe.''\nBelow was a stark expanse of sand next to the blue of the ocean. Gregory remembered hearing that there were only a few places on earth where deserts existed adjacent to the sea, but he could not think where they were. He gave up the effort and turned to watch the flight attendent. Beside him, Raphael spoke a prayer in a surprisingly calm voice. Gregory heard his name in it. However, he didn't get a chance to comment before he had to put his head between his knees and a pillow between himself and the next seat. The plane continued its downward descent.\nWestward leading,\nStill proceeding,\nGuide us to thy perfect light.\nThe three days following the crash became more and more tense as it became obvious that no rescue was on the way. Nothing in the wreckage worked, including the radio, and there was only an occasional plane overhead, much too high and fast to spot the people in the desert below. The days were hot, the nights cold, and the food gradually vanished. Gregory remained somewhat detached from it all, assuming that they would be found eventually, but it appeared that starvation was a more likely possibility.\nMidnight came for the fourth time since the crash. Gregory sat with a blanket over him, his back against the smooth metal of the plane, staring at the brilliant supernova that shone high in the heavens here. From this information and the positions of the stars he had deduced that they lay rather close to the equator, though probably not as far south as Africa. It embarrased him not to be able to guess closer, but his specialty, astrophysics, didn't include much study of the constellations.\nRaphael appeared from the night and sat beside him.\n``Still fascinated by the star?''\n``It seems brighter every night. It should be decreasing in intensity by now. It's been almost a week.''\n``Still think it's a natural phenomenon?''\nGregory sighed. Raphael continued.\n``The last time a star shone this brightly in the heavens, people followed it to Bethlehem.''\n``You don't follow stars. Only a very few stars stay in the same place throughout the night. You'd end up walking straight east for a while, then straight west. Not a productive evening.''\n``Perhaps not, but there's almost no food here, certainly not enough for another day. And I'm not sure I really want to be around when these folks start looking for `alternative' food sources.''\n``You want to leave?''\n``I don't think we have a choice. And night's the best time for travel.''\nGregory shrugged and stood up. ``Let's go meet our deaths, then. Which direction?''\nRaphael shook his head, and fixed Gregory. ``You decide.''\nGregory turned his vision heavenward. ``We'll follow the star, then, for a while. That ought to be the direction of the sea, anyway. I don't suppose we're taking anyone with us?''\nRaphael simply shook his head again.\nSeventy-five dunes later, the night had begun to fade, and the star had long ago slid over their heads and below the horizon. Gregory was tired, more a product of the shifting, uncertain footing than the distance.\n``We should probably find a place to rest for the day,'' he said, looking for such a place without much success.\n``Not necessary,'' Raphael said. ``Listen.''\nBarely audible over the sand was the sound of ringing bells. Gregory turned his head slowly until he could fix on the sound.\n``It's still ahead of us.'' The two men picked up their pace. As they topped the next dune, they saw the source of the sound and could hear it clearly. Nestled in a narrow valley between two dunes lay a village, mostly just a collection of goats and houses, but in one corner stood a church whose bells were ringing to herald the morning. Two kilometers or so beyond, the dunes stopped. Though the sea was invisible from this point, it was clearly there.\nThey descended toward the village, and were met by a throng of people bearing food and water, and speaking rapidly in a language that Gregory could not understand. He turned to Raphael, who grimaced, and responded in a similar tongue, though very slowly.\n``Not similar enough,'' he said at last. ``I still can't understand them.'' Accepting the water, they followed the party down into the village itself. There, they were directed by hand signs to one of the larger houses.\nWithin sat maybe a dozen people, all with wrinkled faces and ancient eyes. They looked up as the two travellers entered, and one smiled. He spoke in the same language that the villagers did, softly, and very slowly. Raphael shook his head and attempted a response. A look of understanding came over the elder's face, and he said something back to Raphael. The two began to converse, slowly. Finally, the elder waved to a villager, and began to talk rapidly to him. Raphael turned to Gregory.\n``I told them about the others at the plane. They know the desert, so they will bring them here. But they also said they were expecting us, and that tonight would be the last night of our journey. Something about a child being born, and rambling about the bright star.''\n``Guess what religion these people practice? What else would they think when a bright star shone in the sky for a week? Tell him we are not oriental kings, and ask him how we can get back to civilization. `Where are we?' wouldn't be a bad question, either.''\nRaphael nodded and began to speak to the elder again. The man listened impassively, then opened a pouch beside him, handed its contents to Gregory. Gregory accepted it, and looked down. Sparkling in his hands was a diamond perhaps eight centimeters in diameter, cut only roughly, but still the most impressive stone he had ever seen. Raphael, too, was stunned for a moment, then listened as the elder spoke.\n``He says that we need not be ashamed of having no gift. This is from his people, and we should offer it to the child tonight.''\nGregory tore his gaze away from the stone. ``Where is this child?''\nRaphael conversed briefly. ``He says we need only follow the star.'' He paused briefly. ``He said that if we do not find the child in a single night, he admits his mistake and we may keep the `pretty rock.' ''\n``We can't take their diamond. We will find no child. But if it's that important to him, I won't begrudge him one night.''\nRaphael smiled and relayed this information, then turned back to Gregory. ``In that case, he invites us to take part in a feast tonight. I hope you like goat,'' he added in an undertone. Gregory smiled and bowed to the elder. ``I'd be delighted,'' he said, and though the language could not be understood, he hoped the gesture would be universal.\n...bearing gifts, we travel afar,\nField and fountain,\nMoor and mountain,\nFollowing yonder star.\nNight brought them to the top of another dune, bearing not only the diamond, but clothes of goatskin made for an infant, water, and Gregory's Polaroid, which he used to take a picture of the quaint middle east villiage in the fading light. ``My colleagues aren't going to believe any of this,'' he remarked, and Raphael smiled.\nAbove them in the sky, the supernova glowed with a brilliant light, the brightest thing in the clear desert night. Taking their bearings from it, the two men began a steady stride. An escort from the village followed them for a time, then bowed once as a group and turned back. Gregory waited until they were out of sight before he spoke.\n``So what do we do now?''\nRaphael frowned, and looked at him. ``What do you mean?''\n``I mean, if we go back and tell these people we found nothing, they'll be crushed. On the other hand, I wouldn't feel right leaving their gifts out in the desert -- it's too likely they'd find them again. And I wouldn't keep them.''\nRaphael shrugged. ``We have all night. Why worry about it now?''\nGregory nodded. ``But we have to worry about it sometime.'' He stopped speaking, looked quizically at the sky. The supernova hanging there had suddenly expanded to about twice its previous size, with a corresponding increase in brightness.\n``That's not possible,'' Gregory said.\n``It seems to be,'' Raphael countered. They kept walking. An hour passed, and the star became steadily brighter.\n``A double star,'' Gregory said at last. ``There were two stars there, and the explosion of one made the other unstable. That's why it's getting bigger.''\n``Fascinating. To think it's happening now, in our lifetime.''\n``It isn't. It took the light of those stars centuries to get here. The actual explosion happened ....'' He stopped.\n``How long ago?''\n``About two thousand years. I was just thinking that it was kind of an odd coincidence. But it's not really.''\nSomething on the next ridge caught his attention. Though it was unclear in the light of the double supernova, there was an obvious imperfection in the smoothness of the desert. He pointed, and they picked up their pace. As soon as they could make it out, they ran.\nAt some time in the last couple of days, a woman and her infant child had crossed this dune in the other direction on a mule. The beast now lay in the sand, unmoving, and the woman and her child rested against it. Both showed signs of dehyration, but both still breathed. Raphael uncorked a flask of water and held it to the semiconscious woman's lips. Gregory lifted the infant and gave it some water as well.\nRaphael looked at Gregory for a long moment.\n``It's a good thing we were here,'' Gregory commented as they helped the woman to her feet. He still held the child in his arms, sound asleep but breathing deeply.\n``Coincidence, I'm sure.'' Raphael said, but his tone was completely expressionless.\nGregors laid the Polaroid photograph of a small child on the table in front of him, where the other men could see it. They gathered around, pushing aside astronomical maps and sheets of equations to make room for the rest of his pictures.\n``And so there was a child where the star led,'' Gregory finished, pushing back his chair.\nOne of the others looked at him strangely. ``I thought you were an Athiest.''\n``I am.'' He lifted the photograph of the child and slid it to his questioner. ``But does it really matter?''\nChristopher Kempke is a dangerous, psychopathic Computer Science graduate\nstudent with too much time on his hands.

Professor Yang is gone. And we are still here. The fact that I wrote this story and you are reading it proves that he was wasting his time, anyway. But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\"Professor Yang,\" of course, was not his real title. One might call him \"Yang Lao Tze,\" but his full title, roughly translated from Mandarin Chinese would have been \"Honorable Old Master of Light and Dark Natures specializing in Sub-Unity Life-Forces.\" Of course, it does not sound that long in Chinese, since all words in Chinese are only one syllable long, unless you count compound words.\nI was the personal aide of Tun Ismail bin Karim, professor of Anthropology at the Royal Academy of Natural Learning of Melaka, while he was on vacation in Tiong Utara. Tun Ismail told me he had wanted to visit the Great Wall of Cin Sih ever since he saw it from the viewport of the restaurant in the orbital station, Angkasa Tiga. Even today, it is the only man-made object visible on the Earth's surface from there.\nSo, although I was only a Chinese servant, he took me with him on his vacation because I could speak to the natives there. Not that he would have had any trouble finding Malay speakers, of course. Tiong Utara had been a Melakan colony for over three hundred years. So had half the world. But the anthropologist in him wanted to experience the culture to the fullest. In any case, I had been working for him for half my life, and we had become as close friends as a non-Malay can be with his Malay master.\nWe were walking down one of the old narrow streets of Peiping near our inn one morning, window shopping, when a middle-aged Chinese man was thrown out of one of the restaurants in front of us. \"Can't you read the sign?\" shouted the bouncer. \"Malays only! Chinese scum! How did you get into the private dining hall, anyway?\"\nThe man just sat in a daze on the street. After tossing a bag out after him, the bouncer went back inside. Sir gestured to me to help him up, and I did. That's one of the nice things about working for him: he has a concern for non-Malays one seldom sees.\nAs I was helping the man, I noticed that he was dressed in what resembled a white ancient Chinese scholar's skirt, black waist-coat and skull-cap, except that the material was very smooth and soft, and to my surprise, it was not soiled by his recent union with the street.\n\"Had a nasty bump, there, didn't you, eh?\" said sir to the man. \"I'm curious about what you're doing dressed in that odd looking outfit of yours, too. Is it for some kind of local cultural thing?\" The man did look out of place in modern Peiping. Most of the locals had gone over to the baju and sarong of modern Asia Tengarra dress, as had most of the world, in order to fit with the styles of the Melaka Empire.\nThe man looked blankly at sir, and said nothing. Now, sir was a pretty liberal Malay, but one does not just stare when a Malay talks to you, so I shook him a bit, urging him to reply.\nHe mumbled something in Chinese.\n\"Come on, man, answer the sir!\"\n\"I don't understand your language,\" he said, in Mandarin Chinese.\nNow, by that time, I was pretty fed up with the guy. Sure, he might not have been able to speak the Sultan's Malay, but, surely he should have known enough to get along. I was all for dropping him right then, and let him thank his lucky stars sir was such a tolerant man, and I said as much to sir. However, sir was intrigued by the man's appearance, so he told me to ask the man in Chinese.\n\"Ok, so you claim not to know Malay, eh? Well, the sir here wants an explanation for your outlandish dress. It's not even Chinese New Year, so what's with the get-up, eh?\"\n\"Uh, I... \"\n\"Well, speak up, man!\"\n\"I... that is to say, well... \"\nSir interjected, \"I think he's still pretty dazed, Yahya. Here, pick up that bag of his, and bring him back to the hotel, where we can question this guy further.\"\nSo I grabbed the bag and dragged\/carried\/walked the man back to our suite. He was mumbling something which sounded like \"Miscalculation? Can't be... It worked, didn't it? Miscalculation?... \"\n\"I created your world, you know?\" he said, as we sat down in the outer room of our suite, where I slept. Sir's bedroom led in from there, so that anybody wanting to disturb him would have needed to go through me first.\n\"What?\" I said, surprised.\n\"I said, I created your world. Or formed it, anyway.\"\n\"This guy's mad,\" I told sir, \"he seems to be claiming to be Allah or something.\"\n\"Really? Quite a psychosis... you sure that's what he said?\"\n\"Well, more or less. He says he formed our world.\" I turned to him and said, in Chinese, \"You say you formed our world? What do you mean?\"\n\"You'll think I'm mad, but I've got proof. I'm from another universe, really... a parallel one.\"\nSir interjected, \"Translate everything he says for me, Yahya.\"\nThe man's name was Yang Chin Shih. He claimed that he was some kind of professor of nature or some such. In his world, he claimed, Melaka was a vassal state of a Chinese empire, not the other way around. In fact, the Chinese empire, which had blossomed from the Sung dynasty a thousand years ago, controlled the whole solar system, in a system-wide bureaucracy where the Chinese were the supreme people, guardian of Heaven and Earth. All other races, \"barbarians\", were subject to the great Chinese Emperor and the Brilliant Chinese People. No non-Chinese could own property; they had no rights, no claim to justice.\nBut he, Yang Lao Tze, saw the cruelty and injustice of their utopia. He felt that all races of humans should be given a fair chance, instead of being made slaves of the Chinese. He felt that this was in direct contradiction to the teachings of that great moralist and philosopher, Kung Fu Tze, which the Chinese claim to uphold.\nIt was also contradictory to the teachings of Buddha, whom most of the religious Chinese still upheld. Yet, the fact that the Buddha was Indian did not prevent the Chinese from mistreating the Indian race all through history.\n(Sir mentioned, at this point, that his own Malay race had also historically mistreated the Prophet's own race, the Arabs.)\nBut because other Chinese in the past who had pointed out this contradiction between the actions and the principles of the Chinese people had mostly been ignored, and because he feared that if he spoke up against the injustice, he would be classed with the \"barbarian lovers\" and stripped of his position in the Imperial Institute, Yang had kept quiet about his convictions.\n(\"Hah! That's what some people have accused us anthropologists of doing,\" interjected sir, \"but we know that although the cultures of the non-Malay are not as advanced to ours, they have value, still, in Allah's plan. And, after all, everyone has the potential of becoming one of Allah's followers.\")\nHe was, however, a learned man in the science of sub-unity life-forces, the microscopic building blocks of the universe itself, and he had discovered a method of harnessing the reverse-yin element. The reverse-yin element had been theorized by other sub-unity scientists as far back as a century ago, but although many findings of sub-unity had been capitalized for things like planet-ship propulsion, the reverse-yin element, which appears to be an analogue of the yin element, which orbits the yang element of the unities that make up compounds, but appears to travel BACKWARDS in time, had yet to be put to the service of China.\nUntil Yang found one, that is. He discovered a way to capture the reverse-yin element, and that led to an antiquity viewer, which, to put it mildly, caused quite a stir among the Masters of Nature around the solar system. He, in fact, received an Imperial Commendation of Nature Studies from the Heaven-Mandated Emperor himself, in Chang-an. This was the greatest discovery in nature studies since Zhou Man Kung discovered that the unity could be dispersed, releasing an enormous force, which could be harnessed for, among other things, electriliquid power and interplanetary travel.\nHaving received an Imperial Seal Grant, he now had virtually unlimited funds to continue his research into the nature of the reverse-yin element. He obtained one of the most powerful liquid-brains to aid him in the manifold calculations. And this was how he came upon his plan to save the world from Chinese oppression.\nFor he had not revealed everything he had discovered to the Imperial Nature Commission. They thought that his device merely was capable of capturing reverse-yin elements and thus providing them with a window in which to `view' history. But what he did not tell them was that he had also discovered a way to send yin and yang elements BACK through the window, thereby `changing' the past. Changing history.\nNot only that, but he had devised a way to project a chi-field that would expand into the new universe thus formed, bringing him into it along with it.\nHe began his experiments by changing small things in the near past, like moving a piece of paper on a desk, after having photographed it in its original position and bringing the picture with him in the chi-field. Then he tried more adventurous things, like changing the color of one of his colleague's vehicle.\nOnce, he prevented a traffic accident which had claimed the life of a friend's son. He projected a board into the past, pushing the boy out of the way of a runaway xi-cart, just before it hit him. When he emerged, everyone only remembered the near-miss, not the mangled child. Yet he had a newspaper article and photograph to prove to himself that history had indeed been changed.\n(Sir interrupted him at that point, objecting that his very act of appearing in the analogue universe would mean displacing something. But he explained that the chi-field starts as a geometric point in the new universe, pushing air and other matter out of the way to make way for his projection.)\nHe had discovered a certain principle of history manipulation: having changed history, one can never go back to the old universe. It had ceased to exist, having been replaced by the new universe. If it were not for the chi-field, there would have been nothing to indicate that the other universe had ever existed.\nFinally, he was ready for his greatest experiment. China had started its technological climb in the Sung dynasty, about a thousand years ago, when philosophers and historians Chang Tsai and Cheng Yi realized that in order to understand the universe, they had to study the things in it. Their work was continued by the influential Chu Hsi, which set the scene for modern Chinese technology to grow from their alchemy. It was this technological edge that kept the Sung dynasty in power for a record 1059 years, far surpassing the 300-odd years of Tang and 400-odd years of Han, and it seemed like it would go on for another thousand.\nHe reasoned that if he could retard Chinese technological growth, other races would not be so far behind, technologically, and so China would not have the chance to enslave the rest of the world.\nAnd the crux were those three key philosophers: Chang Tsai, Ch'eng Yi, and Chu Hsi. If he could get them to divert their energies to another focus, the world would be saved.\nWith his viewer, he determined that the famous legend of how Chang Tsai was inspired to investigate empirical knowledge was true. He was on his way to his student Ch'eng Yi' s house, when he saw a little boy playing with marbles. Since he had a little time, he stopped and watched him. The little boy's marble had rolled into a hole under a rock, out of his reach. But the little boy proceeded to move the large rock off from over the hole with a stick he used as a lever, thus exposing his marble. This had led Chang Tsai to consider, if a little boy could, by studying his surroundings, move a rock he could never carry, what could grown men do by studying nature? Upon arriving at Ch'eng Yi's house, they discussed his new idea, and realized that their concentration upon history would not reveal new ideas like this. That realization was the first step that led them to formulate their `Principle of Empirical Knowledge', which later inspired Chu Hsi's studies and subsequent discoveries.\nYang's plan was simple: he projected a razor blade into the past, cutting the strap of Chang Tsai's sandals. This caused him to have to hunt for a replacement strap, which caused him to be late, which caused him not to stop and observe the boy, which caused him to remain more concerned with studying human history. Thus when he arrived at Ch'e ng Yi's house, they continued with their historical studies as they had originally planned, and the `Principle' was never written.\n\"So in the vacuum thus created, Melaka rose to power and grasped world domination?\" I asked, incredulously. By then, it was evening, sir having ordered us a room service lunch.\n\"So it seems,\" replied Yang.\n\"Well, he certainly has a rather thought-out and complex delusion,\" sir concluded, \"even going to the extent of coming up with that peculiar outfit to back him up. Much of his scenario is recognizable as permutations of real-world situations. He reversed the roles of Chinese and Malay, and made them more severe, probably as a reaction against what he saw as an injustice done against him and his people by our superior culture. Similarly for his allusions to persecution of his prophet's race, the Indians, by his people. That is obviously borrowed from Malay subjugation of the race of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Arabs.\" He turned suddenly to Yang: \"Now admit it, you understand my language, don't you?\"\nYang was taken aback by the sudden accusation, but no trace of comprehension came upon his face.\n\"Hmm, it appears his delusion has even covered up involuntary acknowledgement of the language. This is a really interesting case... I'm sure Daud would like to examine him.\" Daud, being Tuan Dr. Daud bin Muhammad Zainal, psychology professor, close friend, and frequent partner of his in the game of sepak takraw.\nSir was given to acting on impulse when something intrigued him, and Yang intrigued him deeply. He had shown us his reverse-yin device, but he claimed it must have been damaged when tossed by the bouncer, for it would not show us any past views on its screen. (Sir took this as more evidence of Yang's delusion, but Yang asserted that he could fix it, given enough time and equipment.)\nThe outfit he was wearing, too, was intriguing. The material appeared to have been made by the new Kassim-Assad process, invented only last year by that Javan duo, which has an outer molecular structure so inert and smooth that no dirt or grime can attach itself to it, which makes for an unsoilable garment. But the process was still prohibitively expensive, and the whole garment must have cost him a year's wages. He claimed, however, that where he came from, the process was invented by Wang Chen Xiao a century and a half ago, and since then, improved techniques and mass manufacture had made it the standard material for clothes.\nAnyway, as I said, sir was given to acting on impulse when intrigued, and since we were supposed to return to Melaka that week on Khamis, (it was then Selasa, so that was two days away) sir booked an extra seat in the non-Malay section on the kapal terbang and brought Yang back with us to the academy!\nDuring the intervening time, we told Yang about Melakan history, because he was curious about it. We told him about how prince Parameswara of Palembang left his father's court and went to Temasik, and later on to Melaka, where he met some Arab traders who converted him to Islam. He then changed his name to Iskandar Shah, and, by the power of Allah, he proceeded to set up the most powerful empire in the world.\nOf course, this did not happen at once. Melaka was only one state among many in a peninsula subjugated by the Siamese king.\nBut during the reign of Manzur Shah, a curious man appeared at the Melakan court with an interesting gift. Zulkifli bin Said Ahmad had fl ed from Arabia after being accused of heresy and consultation with Satan. He had harnessed a Chinese invention, gunpowder, and produced a weapon capable of killing an enemy from a distance: the bedil. Sultan Manzur Shah believed him when he asserted that he had discovered this by experimentation in natural phenomena, and logical reasoning, not by consultation with evil spirits as he had been accused.\nThus Zulkifli was appointed chief alchemist to the Sultan, and his disciple, a Malay prince and brother of the heir, Tengku Harun ibni Manzur Shah, eventually established the Royal Academy of Natural Learning, during the reign of his brother, Alaudin Riayat Shah.\nIt was from this distinguished institute that the golden age of Melaka blossomed. First came the fire-motor. Then the automatic bedil. The inventions multiplied faster and faster until no nation in the world could challenge Melaka' s superiority.\nThus the Empire of Melaka stretched over four continents and a hundred colonies. Even the Arabs and the Spanish in the end submitted, and with the exception of the Pikanas Federation on the Sunrise Continent, she had lost none of her colonies. But the Pika nas were Malays, anyway, having displaced the native orang asli tribals, who did not even have horses, or even wheels, but only domesticated dogs which dragged crosswood sleds.\nAt first, Yang was horrified. He kept mumbling, \"It only shifted, from Chinese to Malay. Nothing's solved.\" But later, he changed his mind. He confided with me that our world did seem less unfair: at least non-Malays were not slaves with no rights. They were merely second-class citizens, and native peoples, and, by and large, were left to govern themselves, with a Malay overseer, except in the several cases when exploitation on a large-scale basis was thought profitable by Melaka. Of course, Melaka exacted a tribute from every colony, and even most of the semi-independent native states of Africa, and the Southern Sunrise Continent. But it was nothing compared to what China did in his world, he reasoned.\nEven then, however, the world was still not perfect. Oppression still existed. \"Well, I must try again, then,\" he reasoned, \"We have taken a step in the right direction. I must repair my machine and take the next step.\"\nSince I did not believe his machine ever worked in the first place, I just shrugged and humored him.\nWhen we got back to Melaka, sir took him to see Dr. Daud, and I tagged along as an interpreter.\n\"Quite a change from your regular work with the English hill tribes, eh, Ismail?\" The doctor had just finished listening to Yang (through me) tell his story again.\n\"Well, Daud, old chap, you know me... \" replied sir, \"So, what do you make of him?\"\n\"I'd say he has a pretty deep-rooted psychosis here. As you pointed out, he had reversed the roles of our race and his in history, and made up quite an elaborate fantasy with it, too. In his world, the Chinese are higher in technology than we are, and even more oppressive. This is probably due to a Wadinian excessiveness condition. He probably views Malay oppression in an exaggerated manner and postulates Chinese superiority by giving them a technological edge.\"\n\"Uh, sir doctor, pardon, may your servant say something?\" I interrupted. At his assenting nod, I continued: \"He did say to me on the kapal terbang that his scheme wasn't a complete failure because the current regime is less oppressive than the previous.\"\n\"Well,\" asserted the doctor, \"that's merely a Zaini complex of rationalizing to himself to make his position more bearable! But of course, you're just an unlearned non-Malay; you won't know that.\"\n\"No, sir. Sorry, sir.\"\n\"Well, Ismail, I'd say you've found another way to waste your own money again. He's just another typical delusion case.\"\n\"Oh, I won't say the money's wasted, Daud. I did have a good time, and my life's not in any financial straits.\"\n\"Yeah, well, just be glad that his majesty Sultan Mahmud Idrin Shah likes your stuff about those British barbarians, and don't let him think you're wasting his money monkeying around with mad Chinamen instead of producing another of your cultural analyses on those heretical Anglicans. I never understood why he likes reading those boring papers of yours, anyway!\"\nBoth men laughed. The two friends had been jestingly trivializing each other's work for as long as I had known them.\nSir gave Yang a job at his mansion as an assistant houseboy, for he took pity on the poor madman. After a while, Yang did learn enough Malay to understand simple commands, so things worked out pretty well.\nThe vacations were soon over, and his students came back and school started again, and we settled back into our regular routine.\nYang expressed an interest in history and gadgets, so I got him some books for him to read in his spare time, and even a Malay-Chinese dictionary. Malay was a very regular language, so it was relatively easy to learn. Yang was soon pretty proficient in interpreting the Arabic script that Malay was written in.\nThe next year, sir, several of his graduate students, and I went to Britain for three months to continue his fieldwork among the English hill tribesmen. Many of his students brought servants along, too, and we, along with the porters sir had hired in London, carried the equipment and followed them around. Because I had been with sir for so long, I had picked up quite a bit of the English language, and we had a fun summer hiking from village to village, talking to them, and recording their culture, religion and myth. I called myself \"Ian\" among them because it is the Scottish version of my name, \"Yahya,\" and the English version, \"John,\" was too common among them for my tastes.\nOne morning, a couple of days after we returned, Yang met me excitedly.\n\"I've fixed it! I've managed to fix my machine!\" He grasped the sleeve of my baju, dragging me to his room.\n\"What? What machine?\"\n\"The reverse-yin machine! I managed to decipher the Malay symbols for scientific terms and correlate them to my knowledge, and I've managed to rig it up again!\"\nHalf his table was taken up by a jumble of wires, circuits, and various pieces of plastic taped, soldered and glued together. I recognized the main segment as the control panel of the machine he had shown us on that first day, with the same screen above it.\nHe sat down and put his hand on the control panel. Streams of Chinese text started filling the screen, which then split into two windows, one of text, and another of picture. The picture, which looked like an ordinary three-dimensional laser projection, showed me, as a boy of ten, being led into the house by my father! It was the day I was hired by sir! Eleven years ago, I had joined sir's household as a houseboy, but there were no cameras to record the scene! Just another domestic being hired, that's all. No big occasion for anyone but me. But I remembered it, and that was exactly what the screen showed!\nI just stood there for several minutes, mouth agape, immobile.\nMeanwhile, Yang was resetting the coordinates, and the scene changed. It now showed the Sultan's palace. Then the Jaffar dome installed fifty years ago around it disappeared. The scene changed rapidly, while maintaining the same view of the palace, while the surrounding background slipped back in time. The letricars disappeared, to be replaced by close-fired vehicles, then horse-drawn carriages. The entire New Wing of the palace disappeared. Finally, the palace itself was reduced to a relatively small wooden structure, raised on stilts. I recognized it as the original Manzur Shah palace of six centuries ago, which I had seen depicted in paintings and reconstructions before.\nAnd there, in the courtyard, was the great Zulkifli, with his original bedil, about to demonstrate it to the Sultan and his advisers under the royal shelter behind him.\nSuddenly, I realized to my horror what Yang was about to do: \"No! You're going to change history again!\" In that horrifying moment, I realized that if he was not mad all along, then he was what he claimed. This meant that if he changed history, he would kill every one of us!\nHe turned around with a determined look on his face: \"It will be for the best! Melaka must not have the technological edge. Nobody must be allowed to, then there will be no opportunity for oppression.\" He moved his finger, and the air around him started glowing.\nThat must be the chi-field! He's starting it. I lunged at him, but too late: he had projected an air pocket into the metal of the explosion chamber of the bedil and, as it ignited, the whole thing blew up in Zulkifli' s face! That would cause Manzur Shah to lose faith in his science, and...\nThe universe changed.\nWe were in a clearing in the jungle. Or at least it was a clearing cleared by the extruding chi-field. I had just made it into the chi-field before the change was made.\n\"You... you've murdered them! Everyone I ever knew, my whole world... gone... \" I felt like I had no energy left. I just sat down on the undergrowth, empty.\n\"No, they are not dead,\" he said, standing above me.\n\"What do you mean, not dead? They're all gone! The house is gone! This is a jungle!\" I screamed.\n\"Yes, they're gone, but not dead. They were never alive, so they could not die. They never existed, and there is no evidence that they ever existed, except in your memory and mine.\"\nI felt numb all over. Yang collected his machine together, from the table, which had come with us, and put it into his bag.\n\"Come! We have a whole new world to discover, out there. And I daresay it will be a better one than the one we came from.\"\nYang was better prepared this time, and he had packed food, drink, clothes, survival equipment, and the gold which he had obtained by selling his unsoilable outfit. Most of this was packed in a knapsack which I slung over my shoulders.\nWe soon came to a road, which was paved with asphalt. Several vehicles passed us, engines roaring.\n\"I think those are close-fired vehicles,\" observed Yang, \"which means that their technology is about a hundred years behind yours.\"\nI just trudged dully beside him.\nSuddenly, I saw a sign up ahead. I was written in some alien tongue in ROMAN characters! And below that, were the words, in English, \"Coke: it's the real thing!\"\nNow if that didn't beat it all! English! Of all things to find so near Melaka. And there was another sign: \"Melaka: 10 kilometer,\" made of molded white plastic reflective letters on a green-painted metal background.\nPresently, we came to the outskirts of the city. The city of Melaka was a great deal smaller in this world, but it existed. We overheard several people talking in a jumble of Malay and English, and I soon realized that the alien language was Malay written with the Roman alphabet! Had England become the super-state in THIS world? I had a sinking suspicion that we were back where we started, with the English replacing the Malays. But in my world, the Malays had not made the English change their alphabet. Was this world worse off?\nMelaka was little more that what I knew of before as Old Melaka Town, the part of Melaka which surrounded the original port area.\nMost of the men and even some of the women were dressed in various shirt\/trouser combinations, although we did see a few in sarongs, and a couple of women in some variant of the baju kurong. Most of the women wore simple skirts and blouses.\nNear the old city center was the remains of an old fort. I deciphered the sign near it, which said that it was the main gate of a Portuguese kubu fort called A Formosa, which was destroyed by the British. So, the British did come into power, here. But the Portuguese preceded them?\nWe found a museum in a small scale reconstruction of the original palace not far from the kubu. After being told to do so by the Malay guard in English (there was also a little sign on the steps to that effect), we took our shoes off before entering. (So, the custom of removing footwear before entering someone's residence had spread to public buildings? Not so, we found out later: only in certain Malay museums.)\nThrough the displays there, we found out that the Portuguese had conquered Melaka 1511 years after the birth of Christ. (Yes, they used the ancient European calendar system, but I remembered enough information to convert it to the Islamic calendar, so I got a bearing of when it was.) Wow! That was nearly 500 years ago! So, Zulkifli's invention had come barely in time to save Melaka, being only a century before that. Later on, the Dutch took over from the Portuguese, and later, the British, in building an empire almost as extensive as Melaka's, took over the whole peninsula, and half the island of Borneo, as well.\nBut, as we found out from an adjoining museum, (which, curiously enough, incidentally, did not insist on the footwear removal) the British no longer held this empire. After something called the Second World War, the whole empire disintegrated into independent countries. Of which, Melaka was now a state in a federation known as Malaysia.\nSince England did not have monopoly on the empire-making scheme but had to share it with other European nations, this world was less dominated than either of ours, so the colonies had all managed to garner enough power to throw off its yoke.\nMelaka seemed to have become quite a museum town, as it became of little economic importance. The port had silted up due to neglect, and its main industry seemed to be catering to the various history-conscious tourists. For even though its life as a major empire had been cut short, even in this world it had had the largest empire in Asia Tengarra, or as they call it in English, Southeast Asia, prior the the European expansion.\nBy the time we finished gleaning all this information from the various museums, it was late in the evening. We had to do something about surviving this world ourselves. For the moment, we were all right, for Yang had brought enough microrized food for us to survive a month, and, what with the equatorial climate, it would not be too hard to survive without proper shelter, but it would not do for the long run. We walked out to the beach and set up the tent Yang had packed there, although that brought us quite a few curious stares from the locals. I guess they did not have automatic-pitching tents yet.\nYang was encouraged by the data we had gathered. Once more, his meddling had resulted in a more egalitarian world than the prior one. But it still had its colonizing empires, and although things appeared pretty benign then, it looked like things had not been so in the past.\n\"Just one more twiddle,\" he told me that night in the tent, \"and we should be home free. I just need to find the crux for this British Empire.\"\n\"But if you negated the British Empire, won't someone else just take over again? You saw, the Portuguese and the Dutch beat them to Melaka,\" I argued.\n\"True... what I must do is to negate the whole European system. In any case... \"\n\"Hey!\" Someone outside shone a flashlight into the tent. \"No camping is allowed here!\" the voice said in Malay.\nI got out, and there were a couple of policemen standing there. \"I'm sorry; I didn't know... \"\n\"All, right! Where's your I.C.?\" one of them demanded.\n\"I.C.? What... \"\n\"So, he doesn't have his identification card with him, eh?\" He smiled a knowing smile at his partner. \"Well, I guess we'll have to take him in, now, won't we?\"\nOne of them approached me and started to take out his summons book. The other one continued, \"Now, are you sure, perhaps you should look in your wallet?\" he hinted.\nThey wanted a bribe! But I had no money of their kind, and I doubted that my Royal Melaka banknotes would appease them.\n\"Uh... I... \"\n\"What do you say, we talk this over a cup of coffee? Hey, old man!\" he shouted into the tent, \"Won't you join us?\"\n\"Wait... I come soon, good?\" came Yang's voice. A pale glow came from the tent.\nSuddenly, I realized what that was: the chi-field! The bastard! He's going to leave me here! I'm not ready for non-existence!\n\"Excuse me, I'll go get him... \"\n\"Oh, no, you don't.\" The cop grabbed my arm. \"Don't think you can get away so easily... \"\nThe glow was brightening, and soon it would be too late! I punched the cop in the stomach with my other hand and lunged for the tent. The other cop grabbed my leg as his partner went down. I smashed to the ground halfway through the door of the tent, and I could see Yang in front of the reverse-yin machine, half obscured by the chi-field already.\nI kicked the cop with my other foot, but as he fell backwards, the other cop got to his feet and threw a punch at me, but I rolled over and his fist hit the sand. I lunged again at Yang...\n... And fell right through. Half the tent had disappeared, along with Yang, and some of the sand below him. I found myself in the depression in the sand thus created, looking up at the two amazed cops staring the spot where Yang was.\nThe knapsack lay just at the edge of the depression, and I grabbed it, took out the self-defense stunner Yang had packed as part of his survival equipment, and stunned the two men before they could react. As they crumpled to the ground, I realized something: we still existed.\nAccording to Yang's theory, we should have ceased to exist as soon as he twiddled with the past, because we were not within the chi-field. We should have been replaced by the new world thus created, and it should have been as if we had never existed. Yet, there I was, standing over the two comatose corrupt cops. The sand felt real; the stunner in my hand felt real; and I felt real. My bruises even hurt, and I know pain is real.\nIn his haste, Yang had left almost all the survival equipment behind, so I packed up everything and started hiking away. The two cops would regain consciousness in a couple of hours. I know their kind: they would never file a report on me, for fear of being thought mad. They would not have any explanation for what had happened that night, and they were not the kind of people who would stand up for truth merely on principle.\nThat was over twenty years ago. With my superior technology survival equipment, and a considerable amount of luck, I had created for myself a legal entity in the local bureaucracy. Having established a small reputation for myself with some \"inventions,\" I managed to persuade an American firm to hire me as an R&D specialist. Since the Americans were an English nation, I used that name I had given myself during those field trips in England with Tun Ismail, \"Ian.\" Who would have thought, I would have ended up in the North Sunrise Continent speaking English!\nAs for old professor Yang, I suppose he shall continue along his merry way, travelling sideways through time, oblivious to the fact that he is in fact merely spawning off new branches, instead of creating a better universe of equality among races. The poor man would never know that each time he makes a better world, the uglier one he left would continue on without him, and thus his reform would, for them, be futile.\nIan Chai was introduced to SF at the tender age of 7, and to computers at the medium-rare age of 12.

Berch hideous secret; every athlete or artist or general has a Copyright (c)1992 hidden flaw that if struck just so will cause them to shatter.\"\nLong ago, on Earth, a friend of mine bought a windscreen for his motorcycle. He had been a confirmed-helmetless, wind-in-the-face rider; one day he got tired of it and got an expensive, streamlined fairing with a built-in windscreen. When I asked him how it felt, he said the difference was amazing: it was like going from standing in a wind tunnel to floating in a space capsule. But a couple of weeks later he had it removed and it sat in the back of his garage, looking forlorn.\n\"I couldn't deal with it,\" he said. \"It gives you the illusion that there's actually something protecting you from the road.\"\nAnd in the same way the windscreens that I had put up around my own life turned out to be equally illusory. Money, power, intelligence, love ... all null against the forces that have twisted my life. In the end, we are all defenseless. But it happened that my internal enemy and my external enemy cancelled themselves out, and once again I float insensate in my space capsule, daring myself to live again.\nIt started as I sat in the darkened great hall of Vista Del Mar, my home, my prison, watching the sea of stars, waiting for my visitor from Earth. It was not much of a great hall, as great halls go; the same force that has bent my life has constrained me to live a less comfortable existence than, ceteris paribus, I could afford.\nIf I have learned anything in my years at Vista Del Mar it is that there is no escape from the interior flaws of the human mind: every human plan has a fatal deficiency; every perfect marriage has an unseen, hideous secret; every athlete or artist or general has a hidden flaw that if struck just so will cause them to shatter. We are no more responsible for these flaws than a slab of granite is responsible for its flecks of mica; we are born, turned in the lapidary of childhood, and cast headlong into the world like dice. Some fall and break their backs; as it happened, I landed on my feet.\nMy own enemy, the interior one, is that I can no longer bear the sounds of human society. Unlike the eyes, the ears cannot be turned off: even as we sleep, the ears stand guard to alert us of any intrusion. My own hearing has grown sensitive beyond all reason, and it now takes intense concentration for me to carry on a simple conversation or listen to the music I enjoyed in my youth. (There are days when even my own voice or heartbeat seem unbearable.) I have gone through all manner of earmuffs, earplugs, hypnotics, soundproof rooms, white noise, brown noise, filters, and blankers: each only seemed to intensify my frustration. When I outlived my third wife I told my property management people to clear out one of the firm's cargo stations and seal and pressurize one of the spokes. I grabbed an architect from one of our slack projects, sketched out some plans for him, named the place after my last house in California, and moved in six months later.\nThe generators and air exchangers float free of the station, out of my view. When I turn off the last fan at night, Vista Del Mar and I fall endlessly, silent against the backdrop of stars. I sleep, I wake, I eat, drink, work, and read, and I sleep again.\nWithout a doubt, my visitor comes to persuade me or coerce me to leave Vista Del Mar. That he had been able to reach me at all was frightening: it implied either that my telecom setup was not working right, or my hold on Saavedra\/InterNet was not as tight as I imagined.\nWe are all defenseless.\nThere would be no point in refusing to see him. If I did, they would just send another messenger, perhaps less politely.\nIt had begun in my mid-thirties, during the time I was almost constantly traveling, putting together the the first set of transactions that turned my engineering firm into a global conglomerate. At first I thought it was the stress of nonstop negotiations and jet lag that made me oversensitive to noises; I remember very clearly the night in Zurich when, after two hours of sleepless tossing and turning, trying to ignore the muffled voices in the room next to mine, I called the the hotel desk and demanded that the entire floor be cleared out and rented to my firm, as well as the rooms above and below mine. After two other such incidents, it became a topic of gossip in my traveling party and later, of course, in the papers and media. After I was arrested in a New York theatre for assaulting the party in the row behind me who insisted on talking through the first two acts of Siberry's No Borders Here, my first wife finally threw up her hands and left me, complaining that she had not engaged to marry an eccentric.\nI escaped criminal charges by agreeing to see a therapist, and spent the next three years on the couches of an endless series of psychiatrists, neurologists, audiologists, and after they shrugged and talked about stress and nutrition and the pressures of success, I hit the R&D circuit and spent some time with neural reprogrammers and digital biofeedback people. Nothing. Finally I saw a representative sample of faith healers, New Age practitioners, visited a couple of shrines, and gave up. During this time I also made $400 million (making not a few enemies in the process) and bought out my biggest competitor.\nBut it was on my fourth trip to space, on a visit to inspect the new research lab my company had built for Fujitsu Orbital, that I found what I wanted. It was just after we had transferred from the lift vessel to the shuttle that intercepts the lab's orbit; all it does is fire its chemical rocket for a couple of minutes, and then you drift for about two hours. After the engine cut off, there was no sound in the shuttle. I put a finger to my lips and smiled and my two companions nodded. We spent the remainder of the trip in blissful silence, reading and looking out the window. I filed this experience in my memory, knowing that when the time came I would have a place of refuge.\nIt came sooner than I thought: a couple of months later my third wife, Aletha, was driving out to our beach house to meet me for a weekend when her brakes failed on the Coast Highway and she missed a curve.\nShe died that night, in the hospital.\nI had had a brief and unwise second marriage to a research psychologist, during my doctor-hopping days; Aletha came to me some years later, when I thought I was done with romance, and she had the good sense to know that I was not even remotely normal in any meaningful way, and not to try to treat me like I was normal. She spoke softly, and rarely, and did not expect me to speak, except for business or urgent matters. I cannot remember that she ever shouted, except when she cried out when we made love. When she died she left a terrible incompleteness in my life; though I craved silence more than my millions, I would have given anything to hear her voice again.\nA week after she died, I called the architect and told him to to put together Vista Del Mar.\nThe visitor's name was Reid, and he was a lawyer from a big New York firm. I invited him in and realized, in spite of myself, that the threat he represented was remote and contingent (rather than personal and immediate), and I tried to relax. I even offered him a drink, which he accepted.\n\"I bring a proposal, Mr. Saavedra, which I hope you'll consider carefully.\" He spoke very softly; he'd been coached.\n\"Since you've come all the way out here, I'll be glad to. You understand, of course, that there is very little that you could offer that would be of interest to me.\"\n\"Perhaps so. But I'd like to go through it, just the same.\"\nWe did, and spent quite a while at it. All entrepreneurs are the same; we love to read a proposal and shake it around a little like a boxed present, to see how it rattles. It was a big enterprise; nobody but my firm would even have an outside chance of cutting the deal in the first place and getting the project completed. Put simply, it was to rebuild the central government and defense communications complex of New Persia more or less from scratch. They had been operating their major systems out of borrowed and temporary quarters since the War and the Iranian Partition, and evidently either finally got sick of it, or finally raised enough money to consider rebuilding. I'd run two major projects in Persia, one before the War and one after, and knew the right people.\n\"Well, it seems like a reasonable proposition. But I know you didn't call in all your markers just to try to sell me this proposal - if you'd made the proposal to my new projects people at the corporate office, or just transmitted it up here -\"\nReid raised his hand. \"We wanted your personal attention. This job isn't just for Saavedra\/Internet; we're dealing with a very sensitive situation. I don't think the Persians will just roll over; they're looking for your familiar face, to reassure them that everything's going to go down right.\"\n\"I see. As I said, it's a most interesting proposal, but I'm afraid it would be out of the question for me to leave my home for extended travel. You're obviously aware of my personal eccentricities; please respect them.\"\nFor a moment I thought that he was not here to pry me from my home but was merely the errand-boy of somebody who wanted a piece of the action.\nBut he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief, then stopped as he looked out the window again. \"Shit,\" he said. \"I hope you understand that I didn't plan any of this. I'm not behind it; my firm isn't behind it; hell, I don't even know what it's all about, and I probably don't want to know. The thing is, this station - S\/I-14 - has been sold, and our client has made arrangements for you to relocate to another, uh, similar facility.\" He paused. \"Assuming, of course, that you accept and perform the proposal we've discussed, and so forth.\"\n\"You're going to have to do better than that. I may be a little out of touch up here, but I'm pretty sure I still own this station. And a few others.\"\n\"It's not quite that simple. It got tangled up in some corporate stuff, like a sale\/ leaseback arrangement as part of the syndication of stations 12, 14, and 15. I've checked it out; you granted a takeover option to the lead financier that could be exercised if Saavedra\/Internet missed three consecutive payments to the loan retirement fund.\"\n\"Strictly a formality; they're all written like that,\" I said.\n\"Understood. The bank - I've got their name somewhere - sold the takeover rights to a Canadian company. The Canadian company, you must understand, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blaise-Lorton.\"\nA tendril of cold began in my chest, crept down my legs, and instinctively I shivered. Blaise-Lorton was an old enemy, and, I suppose, an unavenged enemy. We'd been in competition for years, and my firm nearly always won out. BlaiseLorton was founded by a pair of elderly Britons; they (and the firm) had been around forever, but were utterly hidebound, and we outdistanced them easily. There had been incidents over the years - anonymous threats, a couple of construction sites vandalized - but we ignored them, figuring that complaining to the police about one's competitors would not enhance the reputation of a firm noted for its discretion. One of the old boys had died a few years back, and I learned in a roundabout way that Lorton, the survivor, somehow blamed me for his partner's death.\n\"Okay, I'm not really pleased with that, but so what? We don't have any cash problems. Hell, we could probably pay off the whole debenture for S\/I-14 today, if we had to.\"\nReid walked to the window and stood, looking out. His voice was almost a whisper, with a note of apology. \"The loan's in default. Your firm has missed the last three payments. If you check your morning mail, you'll find that your controller and two of his people have resigned, and - according to my information - have left the country.\"\nI started to shout that this was impossible, but the words died in my throat. Reid had not come to Vista Del Mar to bluff me. He looked at me with pity as we both came to realize that I was as much in his clients' grasp as I was in the grasp of my affliction.\nHe produced more papers, a more detailed look at the project. I read through them, watching Reid watch me: his face was devoid of victory. Finally I threw down the stack of papers, disgusted. \"This is a completely corrupt enterprise. There's no way in hell to meet the bid price, and I don't think even Saavedra\/Internet can get enough workers on-site to make the completion date.\"\nReid shrugged. \"Not surprising. There may be some sort of political thing behind this. I have no idea. Sign the papers.\"\nI signed, with a trembling hand.\nOn the trip back to Earth and my visit to the firm's headquarters, my internal enemy remained quiescent; lulled, perhaps, by the years in which I had bought silence. But I was firmly in the thrall of my human enemy, and though I briefed my staff on the proposal with relatively good cheer and vigor, it was my enemy's hands that moved my hands, and his lips that animated my smile.\nOf course eyebrows were raised, but they had been raised before. Despite the abrupt departures that Reid had alluded to, I was still in control of Saavedra\/Internet, and though more than once I heard the whispered word \"unsound\" or \"unworkable\" behind my back, my people pitched into the project with bold abandon. I didn't know what they knew about the sale of S\/ I-14, or why I was back on Earth, and I didn't explain.\nI telescoped the feasibility-study part of the project into a few quick weeks, anxious to meet the Persians and (hopefully) wind up my personal involvement in the deal and return to the \"similar\" accomodations in space that Reid had promised.\nAnd as the pace of work quickened, my affliction surfaced again with a murderous vengeance. Distant conversations and snippets of music started my heart beating faster, sending out panic messages. My reaction to sound is an out of control feedback loop: fear of sound, fear of fear of sound, fear of fear of fear of sound, and so on, until the fear becomes a solid mass of panic and I find myself suddenly whiteknuckled and cowering.\nDefenseless.\nEven alone, on the plane to Tehran, I was tormented. Airplanes were one of my special places of respite; nearly as good as spacecraft. In each case we are separated from other humans by an interval across which sound is meaningless and impotent. I dozed lightly on the plane, hypnotized by the monotonous hum of the turbofans (though I jerked upright every time they changed timbre, knowing in my mind that the pilot was changing course or altitude, but feeling, deep down in the cerebellum somewhere, that something was wrong).\nWe landed, and I was met at the airport by a private car with an escort and a small entourage. I prefer to ride alone, but I could hardly refuse the hospitality of the local contractor who'd be handling the meetings with the government and key suppliers. I got off the plane and walked haltingly the few feet to the car; Earth's full gravity coupled with eight hours on the plane made me giddy. I was clapped on the back by a hearty Persian and found myself seated between two such jollies in the middle of the limousine's back seat.\nMy sudden intuition that there was something wrong came two or three seconds too late: suddenly my arms were pinned behind me; the jolly on my left had produced a handgun, and the one on my right was speaking rapid Farsi into a handheld radio. Terrorist kidnapping, I thought instantly, and my stomach froze. Tehran was nominally under the control of the democratic government of New Persia, but the old gangs and factions still roamed the streets. The shock of the incident and my dizziness combined; all of a sudden I couldn't feel my arms and legs, and saw the plexiglass partition in front of my face begin to swim and dissolve into a mass of phosphene dots. As the darkness pulled me under I remembered the anti-ransom statutes (which I had supported, of course) and knew that the terrorists would kill me when S\/I couldn't pay...\n\"Good God, what have you done to him?\" said a distant voice in English. I was riding in a car, probably the same car. I still couldn't move my arms, which were now handcuffed. It was dark, and I smelled dust and exhaust fumes. My head ached and there was the taste of blood in my mouth.\n\"He pass out.\" An accented voice.\n\"Sit him up straight. There you go.\"\nI was yanked up and consciousness slipped away again. I heard voices, saw shapes move, felt the car stop, and start, and turn, and stop, and car doors slam, and heard more voices.\n\"...he has this damned acute hearing. His bloody gift.\"\nI could see, but it was like watching a play at a great distance; there was no sense that the action had anything to do with me. We entered a building, and I was in a wheelchair, being propelled down a carpeted hall.\n\"...and I want the room ready now.\" The voice was behind me, out of sight.\n\"Of course, sir.\"\nFrom the wheelchair to a bed, a rolling bed, a bright light, a sharp jab, and I was washed with nothingness.\nHow best to describe the nature of my transformation? What can I say of awakening to find Sir Harold Lorton standing over me, perspiring and trembling, smiling once and then turning sharply away? In truth, I was not as shocked to see him as I was to realize that when he spoke he made no sound, no sound at all, nor did the men and women in white coats who came in and out and silently adjusted machinery and regarded me as I lay motionless. Nor was I shocked when I learned, by means of the newswire on my office workstation, that a week later he had been found dead, a suicide, in a cheap hotel in Tehran. He must have planned it that way, or he would never have let me see his face in the hospital post-surgery ward. I remember the last thing I heard him - or anyone else, for that matter - say:\n\"His bloody gift.\"\nHarold Lorton conceived of my internal enemy as a gift, and out of revenge he thought to take it away from me.\nI got the last part of the package by mail, an unsigned text from one of the greyworld surgeons on Lorton's team, detailing the whole operation down to dissection of the cochlea and removal of the organ of Corti. \"The work is not reversible,\" he notes, \"but the subject should be able to return to normal life in a matter of weeks.\"\nNormal?\nI spend three hours a day in class, picking up sign language and lip-reading as fast as my instructor can teach it. BlaiseLorton seems to have collapsed, and we expect to retrieve S\/I-14 without protracted litigation, but I'm moving back to California, not to space. I sleep soundly, seven hours a night, regardless of who might be in the next room or the floor above, and once again I visit friends, touch them, see them face to face, watch their children grow.

The situation is critical. Time wheels eternal on the outside, while on the inside the milliseconds clock furiously forward, directed, focussed, progressing one after another faster than those of us on the outside can imagine.\nThey put this box in here, this big one, Big Box, and a lot of little ones, and a mass of cables and cords that sometimes have little boxes on them, and they told us that this confusion is all really very orderly, very structured. It has an integrity of its own, we hear, this collection of machines. Computers. We are Friends. They're different, scores of them; some are quite large with big screens, like televiewers; some are like books, lap-slabs to open up and unfold. They have keyboards, and scribe globes, drawing tablets, 'lectro pens, voxboxes and mouses; datagloves, eyephones, earphones, and sensewear, umbilically connected like satellites to their mother stations, jacked in to Big Box, snaked to each other in patterns that give away the secrets of their relationships.\nThe curious ones are the ones that are so complex they appear to be very simple: the smallest Friend, just a smooth little box with click membranes and the ubiquitous snaking cables that shake hands with the other members present of this species that helps man in its own creation. This little Friend is profound in that it is nothing itself; it projects its offerings into thin air, a shadow computer to gateway its Friends into virtual worlds.\nThe urgency of the situation does not permit the luxury of understanding. To think, to speak, to act, to create, our language creating itself, shaping us as we find new experience in this clutter of technology. We cannot help but wonder how we found our old methods so small and pitiful. We talk, after all, we jot and scribble and gesture as our race has almost always done. The world grows newer around us every day, and we learn newer and more clever tricks, us old dogs.\nWe parse our time into events that happen simultaneously, so that time finally presents its enigmatic sense to us as the convoluted web it is, where the myriad sequences of tiks, toks and units merrily clock on and on in wondrous arhythmic dance. How do we find ourselves here, and now? This mystery, this mesh of machines, extends us and surprises us with the images we make of ourselves. We feed it, we support its health and welfare; we direct it and manipulate it with abandon, with bemusement, with trepidation, and we use it to externalize and negotiate our independent structures, as Friends.\nWe used to think that we related to the little boxes, on our way to electronic conversion and direct inter-think with Big Box. Yet in our crisis it is ever more apparent that these tools are media, messengers as fluid as the air around us, quick as our tongues, so that we play with each other, we poison each other, we influence, infiltrate, experience each other, we conceive through our activities our image of ourselves and learn how to grow it, to chop it into bits, to clone it, to arrive at new configurations, new constructions of ourselves; we build ourselves anew with competencies our history would have proscribed without the help of our Friends.\nEach of us has grown close to special Friends, the ones we find accommodating to our tastes, the ones who find us similarly constructed. We gravitate toward pleasing satellites, we choose the methods that fit our models of ourselves. Some of us have no fingers, and have no use for interfaces requiring digitation; some of us do not or will not speak, or be spoken to; some of us cannot relate to the weird dimension-shifting of virtual datascapes. Some of us enjoy the sense of identity and power in command-response structures, while some of us refuse to accept another's imposed order, no matter how trivial or elegant. We all started with that uneasy mix of sensation, urgency and adventure, the slight queasiness associated with excitement and the unknown, with critical resolutions and formulations long overdue. As the climate grows more pressured to deal with the situation, we extend ourselves to each other ever further, our exchanges become less and less mechanically individuated as we recognize parts of ourselves repeating throughout the network.\nThat smell again -- the acrid warning smell of impending data loss -- I'll have to set aside a moment to check on that, view the scenario and maybe do a little reconstruction. The tape on my forehead itches a little, just enough for me to remember that it's there, and that this smell is its personal warning reminder to me. I naturally dislike this smell; I chose it for that reason, because I tend to brush away these small annoyances until they become quite larger. Some of us are more physical, we generally like the contact stimulus of metal, plasteel, glass, the satisfaction of resistance to touch, the click of keys. Friends often suggest small comforts between themselves.\nI survey this environment, all of us Friends, and I wonder where they will take us next, where we will take ourselves, and what wonders we shall experience in the evolution of this science, this art of contact. I must get back to work. After all, the situation is critical. Indeed, it is critical; but again, after all, we are all Friends; Friends and Friends alike, and the crisis is ours.\nElizabeth Dykstra is a cybernetician at Pacific Bell where she researches group phenomena and computer interfaces.

Relaxing for a moment, its tentacular form took on the appearance of a dark, malignant cat; a cat with too many legs and unusual suckers at its extremities. The eyes, though. The eyes were bright, sharp and definitively cat-like. The only remaining question was: What did it WANT?\nOozing its way towards him was the creature he had seen so many times before. In nightmares and on cinema screens, it had haunted him relentlessly, the stuff from which nightmares are made. Harold thought back to that morning...\nThe paper was delivered, miracle of miracles, earlier than usual, and Harold was finishing the Environment section when a classified ad caught his eye:\nMake Your Dreams Come True\nFor only 40 Pounds we\nGUARANTEE\nto realise your wildest dreams.\nTel. 071 495 1265\nHarold was surprised, and perplexed. Although he had been a quantity surveyor for over a decade, in his heart he still yearned to realise his youthful dream of emigrating to the long-developed Lunar colony. Besides, he supposed, even on the Moon they must SURELY have some quantities which he could make a living by surveying? Forty pounds, though...\nTen agonising minutes later, Harold had decided that he could lose nothing by simply phoning the company.\n\"Hello? I'm ringing about your advert in today's `Guardian'.\"\n\"You mean the Dreams, Inc. Special Offer advertisement, Sir?\"\n\"Yes, that's the one. `Make your dreams come true.' I suppose *ha ha* that it's some sort of elaborate practical joke, yes?\"\nThe voice sounded wounded, \"`Practical joke,' Sir. I assure you that our methods are...\"\n\"You mean this is for real? Hmmm. What does `realise your wildest dreams' mean, anyway?\"\n\"If I could just take your name, Sir, perhaps you would be free to attend a session this afternoon?\"\n\"Well, I'm not too sure. The money. Forty pounds. Well...\"\n\"I assure you that all monies are payable only on satisfactory completion of the contract, Sir.\"\n\"You mean, that if my dreams don't come true, I pay nothing?\"\nIn the manner of a superior maitre d', the voice relaxed as it effortlessly replied, \"Sir has grasped it precisely, Sir.\"\nTwo hours afterwards, Harold was sitting in the offices of Dreams, Inc., waiting to meet the company director. There was nothing dream-like about the reception area. On the contrary, the room was almost dentist's-waiting-room-like in its drabness, providing even aged copies of `Punch' to complete the effect. After a while, Harold was ushered through a small, painted-wood door into a short corridor. Ahead was another door, oaken in appearance, which bore a traditional, brass nameplate:\nDirectore, Dreames, Yncorpyratted\nThe darkness crouched against one wall, almost a living thing in its intensity. Harold nervously appraised it, then dismissed childhood nightmares from his mind as he walked to the door. Nonetheless, he edged past the inky patch as he approached the door, never once turning away from its blackness lest some Lovecraftian horror break its surface. As he sidled by, it happened.\nSlithering and sliding, it came out of the darkness. Relaxing for a moment, its tentacular form took on the appearance of a dark, malignant cat. A cat with too many legs and unusual suckers at its extremities. The eyes, though. The eyes were bright, sharp and definitively cat-like.\nOozing its way towards him was the creature he had seen so many times before. In nightmares and on cinema screens, it had haunted him relentlessly. The Stuff from which dreams are made. The thought jolted Harold back to his senses. Perhaps this malformed horror was the manifestation of his dreams promised by the advert.\nHarold, hand reeking trepidation, stretched out an arm toward the octopoid abomination in automaton fascination. What WAS it? His hand brushed the surface, but he felt nothing as it passed that Serling-inspired boundary which confronted him. A sharp yelp of pain restored his deadened faculties to conscious control and, in an abrupt movement, Harold almost teleported to the now-open oaken door. He stepped through into...\nLewis Carroll oft warned of the dangers of a meeting with a Boojum, leaving the nameless Baker's fate as ample warning to all those tempted, by curiosity or perverse predilection, to search for Snarks in the wildernesses of the world. He did not, however, proffer much advice on how to deal with such an unexpected encounter.\nThe courtroom was unique in its grotesqueness. It HAD to be. Such a distorted jury box only could have been devised by a mind whose owner had spent much of his life dabbling in illegal and proscribed substances, a practise much frowned upon in Society. The lines of the benches seemed ill at ease in the current dimensions, and were visibly attempting to escape into some forgotten corner of space-time. Harold hoped, fervently, that they would be successful, and that the jurymen -- the word is applied loosely -- would follow rapidly.\nThe collection of... beings in the box is best left undescribed. But, if you must, picture a messy accident involving a duck-billed platypus and a bicycle pump. Now picture the result gesticulating wildly for you to take the stand before a judge whose sole qualification for the task seems to be his shape: that of a huge, white, curly wig. With eyes.\nHarold took the stand, only to have a large Bible placed in his right hand. The Bible gripped his arm before turning to him, and rasping, \"Recite The Oath, dummy!\" Glancing down, Harold noticed that the book had... protruberances. Not arms, as such. Nor, if Harold was honest with himself, could he say that it possessed any facial features. Nevertheless, it continued to stare at him, after the manner of a basset hound on acid. An ANNOYED basset hound. \"The Oath, idiot. Say it!\"\n\"Er. I swear to tell the Truth, the Whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, So help me...\"\n\"What's that?\" interjected the book, \"Read the OATH from the card in front of you, fool.\" Harold looked around briefly before seeing a card which positively had NOT been there before. He read, disbelievingly:\n\"I swear to tell the truth. Or part of it. Or something I believe to be the truth. Or not. As I may decide. So help me, God.\"\nThe scene faded. An office presented itself. The scene faded. A white rabbit bounded past, clutching a pocket watch and loudly exclaimed. The scene faded. \"I'm late! I'm late!\" the aardvark screamed. Scene fade. A huge ball of string rolled past. The string was knotted in several places, and one of those knots hurtled towards Harold, or possibly the other way round. The scene faded.\nThe dentist's waiting room returned, and Harold looked up into the eyes of a young man, dressed in a doctor's white coat. The man looked about thirty, had shoulder-length blond hair and wore a stethoscope around his neck. Leaning over Harold's prone body, he whispered seven words which engraved themselves on his memory:\n\"Harold, Man.

Now walk.\" \"You're crazy, you old bastard.\" she hissed, taking a step towards the ledge. A distant crack of thunder was heard and a swirling choir of voices began to rise ominously. \"Crazy! Cr-\" ____________________\nPhyllis took an outlet. \"How much longer?\"\n\"Fifteen minutes.\" said the shell. She was going to die in here. Ursula's wedding was only four days away, and Phyllis felt obligated to try another print if she died. She was annoyed, feeling too much pressure to contemplate this noir spy mess that the VanGehr Group engine had spit up. She looked out of the rain-spattered bullet train window. Quebec's streets were skidding by like wet black cat hairs through her dim reflection in the glass. It looked very different than she remembered it. Phyllis closed the shell, settled back in the deep white folds of her seat and thought about Process.\nProcess hadn't allowed itself to be benchmarked in nine quarters. Not that the other IM players were complaining too loudly, Process Publishing Industries had always taken the benchmarks by light-years. Most were content to let CEO Paul Reuters and the PPI network of enigmacrats thrash and twist in a web of what was beginning to appear as its over-cultivated mystique. Besides, other corporate prime movers in Image Manipulation were tired of tumbling vats of capital into the black hole of random number benchmarking. Now, at last, a certain parity seemed reachable and majors like ClimeLight\/Fissure and Junee-July could concentrate on the more pressing but no less challenging craft of star-making.\nHow Process tested so well was pretty widely known. The entropic harrier it was only half-jokingly called. Their variant of seed value generation based on the interference tier-contours created by 4D graphs of radioactive decay and simple Lorenz attractors had proven a ruthlessly effective, if somewhat quasi-mystical approach to the problem. The variant was Process' ace card, however, and would have remained a standard for years.\nThe house was old and pathologically gothic, all odd angles, bleak corners and towering cloisters. Set near the edge of the Gaspe' peninsula, the place was about as far away from civilization as this ancient province allowed. Phyllis found herself waiting in a sparse antechamber after having been buzzed through wrought iron gates she would have guessed to be fourteen feet high. She had been led by a smallish bespectacled man of fifty or so down six-hundred feet of winding private road. He had spoken with a harsh French-Canadian accent. Despite all her preparation and determination, she felt extremely nervous. This shoot had to be good; she wouldn't get another chance. The rain had stopped on the taxi ride in from the station but the gray sky and cool autumn weather seemed to mirror her feelings of unease. The little man had taken her coat and addressed her as \"Miss Cope\". For some reason she was reminded of the teasings of an ex-boyfriend, \"Miss can't Cope\".\n\"I am terribly sorry, madam,\" said the man, \"but Mr. Nareid is preoccupied at the moment and has advised me to show you in. If you please.\" Phyllis nodded politely and, lifting her gearbag, followed his gesturing hand into a large, skylit circular room. There was a disused marble water fountain at its center. The man followed her in. \"Mr. Nareid informs me that you are a photographer.\" Phyllis was looking absently up at the grimy, stained-glass dome.\n\"Yes, of sorts\" she half laughed. \"I'm a cam-tech really.\"\n\"Oh, I am sorry,\" he was looking up at her and Phyllis felt that he was standing uncomfortably close. \"There is a difference?\"\n\"No! No, not really,\" said Phyllis, instantly regretting her nervous response. \"it's just not a term I've ever used.\"\n\"I see,\" he said slowly, and there was an awkward moment of silence before he gestured, \"Make yourself comfortable.\" She thanked him and accepted his offer of tea, hoping to redeem herself somewhat. He left and Phyllis perceived for the first time the place's dead air and unsettling feeling of perversity, the decayed lavishness of the entire estate. Whatever sort of person this James Nareid turned out to be, he was not, she guessed, going to be an average shoot. Even by Process' standards.\nImage manipulation was the inevitable resonating phenomenon of a media mad world. A miracle of style becoming substance. Every icon, every movement in art, music, video, holography, and film, captured, treated and distorted by the latest computer rendering gear. Hyper-real storylines cropped, spliced and juxtaposed, culled from every source old and new, from Homer through Messiana\/Hologramic slasher vids. The latest in rotational dissolving and recombinant overlay-tracing applied to the bulk of the flotsam of the human information system. After so many years now it had become reality's feedback loop. The gather and distort technique had been born out of necessity, of course, in the years before automatic royalties, with the standing copyright laws taxed to the limit and straining to hold back the dike. Process had been there from the start. The vast bulk of Process' profits still came from the quaint black octagonal boxes found at every HDHF local, the IMAGER. Inside where girl and boy could tumble their way down a hierarchy of silly menus packed with time-frames, icons and double entendres - to leave with their own \"Totally unique!\" little chunk of the zeitgeist. A fine time for all concerned as PPI had years earlier licensed off its IMAGER to the Fissure corporation, pretensions to high art intact as well as safe gliding distance above the red.\nThings had changed since then and the better IMs, like Process, had learned almost unconsciously to play to the last and all inclusive human gallery. They had realized that at the end of the day people wanted something to hold on to, invariably, an intelligibly convoluted mirror.\nAs a child growing up in Montreal, Phyllis would spend most nights alone. Her grisette mother worked and slowly grew more unsound, acting ambitions fading out year by year. At the age of nine Phyllis was sent to Paris to live with her cousins. Her only truly enduring memories of early childhood: a collage of neon, white light and pain. That light had stayed with her, had kept her straight through the shooting of some of the most bizarre imagery a jaded world could come up with.\nThings had gone better in Europe, later on. She had returned to the Americas to attend film school in Cote-Saint-Luc and had done her cam-tech grunt work in LA. It got pretty ugly for awhile, months of shooting warehouses and dockyards for the truly sleazy Estienne and Finch. She guessed her couples work for respected independent Lemaitre! had gotten her the Process call. Phyllis hated that idea, however, because couples made for some of the worst subject matter. Most of them got drunk or bent on some analog first so they could get loose enough to screw in front of a stranger, but somehow the returns had always been okay. Shooting Process, however, was every cam-tech's grail, and when they flew two reps to Vienna to watch her shoot an industrio-demolition sponsored by some bored Austrian art fags, she had felt that white light rising in her head.\n\"Ms. Cope, isn't it?\" said a voice behind her. Phyllis turned to see a thin, almost emaciated looking young man of twenty or so approaching her and smiling. He wore an oversize half-buttoned white shirt and pastel red baggy silk pants. He had a shoulder-length mop of wispy black hair. Phyllis' first impression was that of some nineteenth century lion tamer's apprentice.\n\"Yes,\" she smiled and shook his small, bird-like hand. He grinned widely. \"James Nareid.\"\n\"You can call me Phyllis.\" she said, assuming her best friendly-but-professional tone.\n\"Yes. Phyllis. I see Ryeland has forced his tea upon you.\" He was looking fixedly at her with wide hazel eyes that suggested no depth at all.\n\"Hardly,\" she said uncomfortably, his apparent pomposity and atrocious hawk's gaze distracting her, \"it's very good actually.\" There was a brief pause before James spoke.\n\"Well, I've never done anything like this before so...do I pose?\" he said, looking hopeful.\n\"Oh, its nothing like that at all,\" she said laughing and beginning to root through her bag. \"I'll be shooting almost continuously for as long or as briefly as you like. Obviously,\" she began pulling out several objects and resting them carefully on the floor \"the more variegated,\" she continued fastening a lens and new cartridge on her Leico TiarraShot \"-this is my favorite camera- the more variegated the shots the more chance we have of obtaining interesting results. Most random Image engines work best with diverse shots of the main subject.\" She raised the camera and began shooting, slowly and reflexively circling her subject. James was looking right at her with an amused smile. \"So just move around and pretend I'm not even here. Try to do whatever it is you'd normally be doing.\"\n\"What if I'd be masturbating?\" he said, with the same fixed grin.\nThis is going to be cake thought Phyllis.\n\"By all means, makes for some great stuff, semen. Nothing beats the old money shot.\"\n\"Well,\" he said \"I wouldn't be, but just checking. Maybe I'd have some tea.\" He poured himself a cup from the pot Ryeland had left on the tray and stared in profile at the fountain. Phyllis was now shooting from a crouched position.\n\"Do I understand correctly, that in this deal I have you for as long as I like?\" he asked, looking now up at the skylight and taking a small sip of tea. \"Or while the optic medium holds out, maybe thirty hours worth of straight shooting.\" she slowly rose from her crouch. James was now looking intently into his china cup.\n\"This is good isn't it. A lovely blend.\" he smiled at her, \"I do have a little something planned...\"\nEvery IM had by definition a huge database of countless portrayals, delineations, and distortions of almost everything and everyone worth capturing ever. These catalogs were more or less interchangeable, as there were only so many sources for interesting material and the rate at which the new became the old had almost achieved real-time. Stars of course were IM's lifeblood and the majors spent vast amounts of resources farming out difference and intrigue. Icons were routinely erected overnight only to have their electronic exoskeletons ground into image-gristle weeks later. Manufactured stars were not, however, the lifeblood of Process. They always let you be the star, for the right price. An extravagant one. That any IM could command the compensation for a location shoot, random engine recombination, and print that PPI could was partially attributable to their quality but mainly to their reputation. The finished product was good, this was undeniable, the Process engine seemed to be able to make intuitive and often otherworldly connections to attenuated and rarely used perceptions of cultural totems disused by more mainstream IM's, but it wasn't that good. Yet to own a Process episode of your own Process shoot was a status symbol the monied worldwide coveted. Guaranteed only one original to exist, generated at the Process labs with no human intervention. As their infrequent advertisements claimed, two things in life are certain, only one isn't. Even the daughter of the CEO of Junee-July had provoked no end of embarrassment at corporate headquarters when she boasted of her Process shoot in an interview with CRUEL.\nPlaying pool turned out to be the little something that James had spoken about. He had led her upstairs into an oak paneled room with a huge table and deep maroon carpeting. The room was dank with the smell of mold. For nearly an hour he quietly racked, broke and cleared. Phyllis was doing her best to make this look interesting, she guessed he wasn't half bad as a player, but this would undoubtedly make for poor source material and she knew who would have to carry the can for that. Occasionally he would light a cigarette and Phyllis would frantically try every trick she knew to make it look dramatic. Ryeland came in and offered another round of tea, which was declined, and informed James that he would be leaving for the afternoon. \"Is this okay?\" he asked Phyllis a few minutes later, after clearing the table and beginning to set up a new break.\n\"Fine, sure.\" she said, trying to sound intrigued.\n\"If not, then there is something else I might be doing.\"\nPhyllis followed James down a long, winding, semi-lit hallway that sloped for maybe forty-five yards, shooting the entire way.\n\"I've always wanted to record my dreams,\" said James with a hint of resignation, \"but you people have made that desire obsolete, haven't you?\"\n\"I'd like to think we augment peoples dreams.\" said Phyllis, shooting now at close range, nearly over his shoulders. James stopped suddenly, maybe ten meters from what appeared to Phyllis to be the end of the corridor. \"Oh wait, one thing I have got to have first, those inner lights? Do they still do that?\" It took Phyllis a few moments to understand what it was he wanted.\n\"Like in Goelsann's Deduche' Jar\" said James.\n\"Micro-machines?\"\n\"Yes! Can you do that?\" He seemed almost childishly enthused by the idea.\n\"Sure.\" Phyllis said, halting the shoot. Micro-machines. Oh brother. How hackneyed can he make this? She knelt again to root through her equipment bag. \"I have to tell you though, they do require you to sign a waiver authorizing a hypodermic injection. Also,\" and suddenly the thought of injecting a syringe full of little paddling chemo-phosphorescent machines into this fey man struck her as too repulsive for words, \"also, you may experience some after-effects until they are completely flushed out of your system.\"\n\"Like?\"\n\"Like headaches and diarrhea.\"\n\"That doesn't sound too terrible,\" he said, the smile fixed on his face. Phyllis carefully unwrapped a new needle and handed both a pen and the needle's paper jacket, which doubled as both waiver and warning, to James. He signed it with short quick stabs.\n\"What density?\" asked Phyllis.\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"Do you want a few or a lot?\" She was crouching and holding the needle carefully, with both hands.\n\"Oh, light me up like a Christmas tree, by all means.\" She took his arm and slowly administered the machine injection.\nHe was leaning against a brick wall of the corridor and looking at her with half-lidded eyes as she fastened a chemo-sensitive lens to the TiarraShot.\n\"How long have you been doing this?\" he asked. Phyllis stood up and noticed, oddly and for the first time, that she was considerably taller than James.\n\"Almost ten years, professionally four.\" She smiled and raised the camera.\n\"An old hand. You've seen some weird stuff, I bet.\" He was smiling and walking slowly towards the corridors' end.\n\"Nothing's shocking.\" She said, following closely.\n\"That's good because some people might not feel up to recording something I really want in this.\" And the room opened up behind him. Phyllis did not feel well at that moment. Not at all.\nShe was naked and tied to a rusted metal table with red stockings. Her eyes were open but un-focused and her hair was a matted brown. She was covered with scars and uttered streams of non-words, like someone speaking in tongues, every few moments. \"This is a friend of mine, Phyllis. Her name is Alice,\" said James. He circled around the table and looked down at the woman with an adoring glare. Phyllis had let her bag fall to the floor and the Leico drop to her chest upon entering the large room but had now raised the camera again, almost in self defense. The room at the end of the corridor turned out to be large and rectangular, maybe twelve by twenty meters. One wall was completely framed glass with a view out into what Phyllis guessed to be the rear quadrangle of the estate. The ceiling was high, maybe twenty feet. The room was dimly illuminated on the near side by an arc lamp that stretched from one wall out over the table. There were several small wooden deck chairs scattered around the table. It was nearly dark outside and the rain had begun again. Through the camera James was beginning to glow with the tiny red, blue and green lights of the micro-machines.\n\"I'm sort of a medical enthusiast, Phyllis.\" said James. She noticed, as she circled around to his side of the table, the small tray of surgical implements. \"I've got some radical ideas in the area.\"\n\"So she needs an operation?\" said Phyllis, getting weak in the knees, her voice unsteady.\n\"Yes, very desperately.\" He smiled fixedly and looked at Phyllis.\n\"James,\" she said lowering the TiarraShot, \"there was something in the tea.\" She felt the rising edge of panic in her voice. The room seemed to be the culmination of some deliberate and insidious chain of events. The implements, her camera, the table and its babbling girl, all felt like props in a game that was about to end.\n\"There was something in the tea, yes. Can I begin now?\" He ventured a quick glance at the camera dangling at her neck. Phyllis raised the camera and un-halted. James was now almost a blazing sheet of white through the lens, so she reflexively keyed the shutter speed down to avoid retinal burn. He slowly raised a small cutting tool and leaned over Alice. The first incision extended along her left side from her neck to just below her ribcage, a tiny thread of blood following his hand. The girl on the table let out a low moan and then uttered a small stream of sibilant non-words. Phyllis struggled to hold the Leico steady, shooting now over James' shoulder. He cut her again, more deeply this time, a small jet of blood leaping out of her neck and onto the table. Phyllis let the camera fall and backed quickly away from the table. \"James, this-\" she couldn't seem to form words and in her eyes she still saw the faint ghost of James' blazing silhouette leaning over the table. \"I have to go,\" she turned, stumbled, and hit glass. The rain was coming down hard and cold, running down her face. Phyllis felt dizzy, burning with confusion and slicing pain.\n\"This thing I'm doing here,\" James said softly, kneeling in the broken glass and firmly holding her bleeding arm, \"is a dedication.\" He let go of her and she watched in fear and bemusement as he ran the scalpel along his wrist. He took her arm again and pressed his wrist to it.\nPhyllis got up unsteadily and walked into the room. Her vision was swimming and she felt an unbearable nausea. Alice was looking mutely at her from the table, unblinking.\n\"If you are feeling ill,\" said James \"we could finish some other time.\" Phyllis had spilled her equipment bag by the entrance and was clumsily packing.\n\"Yes,\" she muttered, speech feeling alien and unnatural to her mouth. She got up, walked over to the glass wall, gave James a half-nod and ducked out of the broken portion of the window into the rain. She found herself choking back a sob as she stumbled around the outside of the house through the downpour, fighting an urge to run. The rain felt like molasses running down her face. The words and glances of peers reverberated in her head. A cam-tech was a go-between for star and fanatic, a mere tool of the truly famous, the elite. They couldn't know that Phyllis had wanted very much to opt out of the loop. She could scarcely admit it to herself. She remembered her mother's eyes, the curse that fame denied can really be. She just didn't have it. She would fail this audition, there was no doubt. \"Miss can't Cope...\"\nHe was sitting in a deck chair by the illuminated end of the room, smoking a cigarette. The girl and the table were gone. Phyllis breathed deeply and tried to calm the speeding sensation her body was experiencing. D-Lysergic acid, she told herself, kid's stuff. She silently pressed the camera to the glass and un-halted. Momentarily James turned and looked at her. She had the momentary thought that he looked like a vulture but resisted an urge to run and kept shooting. A smile slowly spread across his thin face.\nWelcome aboard. You handle yourself very professionally. I like your technique. My son is my favorite camera by the way, and he likes you as well. We'll be in touch. P. Reuters\nThere were two prints in the package, the first being Ursula's wedding gift. Phyllis realized she must have left it behind when her bag had spilled. An attached note chided her for her taste in IM's. Phyllis couldn't seem to care about that at the moment, and took an immediate inlet into the other episode. For many minutes the thing made very little sense indeed. A montage of beautiful, wavering portraits, all vaguely familiar, all with the strangely vast more real than reality edge every Process episode seemed to possess, but no evidence of James at all. The thing then segued into a minimal children's story of a farm girl who loved cats and had a cruel grandmother. The whole thing somehow was the most astonishing episode she had ever seen but she couldn't figure out why until the final few moments when the engine seemed to power down from a spectral, idealized shot of a gigantic urban skyline into the episode's source material. The final shot was a ghostly, skeletal treatment of a woman soaked in rain, seen through glass and holding a camera, treated with some sort of hyper-trophied ray tracing algorithm. The micro-machines circulating beneath her skin tiny, red sparks.\nShe spun with grace and impossible quickness. The gun skittered across the tar and arched in slow motion off the roof. \"- crazy if you thought you could kill me, Al.\" said Ursula. Albert Einstein fell to his knees. He began to cry. \"You're pathetic.

So on she ran, spike heels clicking frantically against the pavement.\nFeeling her breath grow short, Lucy gradually slowed down. Eventually, she came to a complete halt in a shadowed alley, dark as the passage to Hell. She crumpled to the ground in exhaustion, and outrage at her feebleness welled over her. Slipping off a shoe, she massaged her troubled foot. `Lucy, Lucy, Lucy... when are you going to learn? Never walk anywhere without decent shoes.'\nHer reverie was interrupted by the thudding report of a man's shoe striking pavement. Immediately, she crammed her feet back into her less-than-sensible heels, and began clicking away.\nBut the man's footsteps grew more pronounced, the basso pounding of his dress boots an eerie counterpoint to the quick, high skipping of Lucy's heels. A hand touched her shoulder. She stopped abruptly and whirled around to glare at her pursuer. \"What do you want Tyre?\" she demanded. Her pursuer was very thin and average height, and the long black trenchcoat he wore emphasized his gauntness. Her shoes made her much taller than he. \"Lucy, why won't you sell me that buckle?\" he panted.\n`He sounds so old...' She glanced protectively at her waist. The buckle her mother had left her rested on a wide leather belt. It was a very exotic looking silver carving of the moon. `I can't believe Mother never wore it. It would have set off the white in her hair so beautifully.'\n\"I told you, Tyre. It's been in my family forever. I can't just go and sell it to someone who can't even explain why he wants it... Now please, Tyre, if you're going to continue with this, just leave me alone!\" With that she spun on her heel and moved to leave.\nTyre grabbed her shoulder again, but she spun about, kicked his left shin with her four inch heel, and stalked off. Her pace was such that the clicking of her shoes against the road was dignified, even majestic, and she held her head high. `That'll teach him not to screw with a Lady!'\nThrough his agony, Tyre shouted after her, \"Lucy! I must have that buckle! Damn, I'm bleeding!\"\nHe began to chase after her once again, but upon hearing his motion, she broke into a sprint. With his injured leg, Tyre simply could not keep up. And now it was throbbing. He turned and began to walk home, the pain in his leg intensifying until it was all he could do to limp.\nShe ran for a while, until finally she broke a heel and tumbled to the ground. `Dammit! I hate these shoes!!' She sat there a while, gritting her teeth at whatever supreme being had inflicted this day on her. Despite her best efforts at self control, a tear appeared at the corner of her eye. After a few deep breaths, she stood up. Her posture was somewhat crooked, but she limped on, trying awkwardly to compensate for her broken heel. She grimaced. Well, I guess I got what I deserved for running like a madwoman in four-inch spikes...\nSome time later, she arrived at an old house, the home of Albert Simmons. They'd been close friends since high school, and she'd been staying with him since her mother's death.\n\"Al!\" she called, pounding on the front door. \"Let me in! I forgot my keys! I need to talk to you.\" When no one answered, she tried the door. `Unlocked... he must be writing...'\nHaving taken off her shoes, she sat on the floor and began to rub her aching feet. The day's tensions seemed to melt away into the rust-colored rug, like butter spread on hot toast. `Mmmm... That's fantastic...' Once she had eased her throbbing feet, she rose and padded down the hall toward Al's library. There was a mirror on the far wall, and she couldn't help but see her reflection. `God... I'm a mess...' She began brushing her hair with her fingers, to little effect. `Oh well. Al probably won't notice anyhow...' When she got to the library door, she poked her head in and was assailed by the muffled sound of Queen's `Bohemian Rhapsody' played through a headset. Albert sat behind a huge desk, clicking away at his typewriter. He was oblivious to her presence.\nIt was clear to her that she was not going to get his attention until he was ready to rejoin the universe. The days when you could distract Al from a great idea had ended soon after he realized that these distractions were why he so often forgot what he was writing about. So she yawned and stretched out on the overstuffed sofa near his big mahogany desk.\nTyre had just barely gotten inside his apartment when he fell to the floor, his bleeding leg crumpling beneath him. He groaned in agony, and struggled to get up.\nHis girlfriend, Amanda, came rushing into the room. \"Good Lord, Tyre! What happened to your leg? You look like you've been shot! Here let me take a look at that.\" She moved over to him and bent down to examine his wound.\n\"I had a run in with Lucy. She tried to use her shoe to make Tyre shish-ke-bab!\" he replied, through teeth clenched with pain.\nShe probed the wound with a finger. \"Oh, and I suppose you'd done nothing to provoke the attack...\" Her sarcasm was lost as fresh pain shot up Tyre's leg.\n\"Argh! I just asked her to sell me her belt buckle...\"\n\"The one her mother left in her will? Really, Tyre, that's in terribly poor taste. And besides, what could you possibly want with that thing? Lucy showed it to me when we were in high school -- we were snooping around her parents' room; it's ugly. Let me get some peroxide for that leg.\" With that she left the room, returning a moment later with a brown bottle and a bag of cotton balls.\n\"Get away from me with that!\"\n\"It's for your own good. This won't hurt nearly as much as that leg will if it gets infected.\" She poured peroxide on a cotton ball and began to swipe it over the cut. She winced at the look on Tyre's face. \"You still haven't told me why you want that awful belt buckle.\"\n\"I did some research after the first time I saw it.\" Tyre replied, \"As it turns out, it's a relic. It dates back to the Age of Chivalry. That buckle was actually a pendant said to have been worn by The Lady of the Lake. It's not doing Lucy any good, but it would be a fantastic addition to the exhibit of Druidic artifacts over at the museum.\"\n\"Well, if she doesn't want to sell it, I really don't see what you can do. It's hers to sell or keep as she sees fit. And it's been in her family for so long, I wouldn't be at all surprised if she's descended from its original owner. Do you really want to piss off the descendant of the Lady of the Lake?\" She chuckled a bit. \"Lady of the Lake! God!\"\nHe decided to ignore the last bit, reaching for the old pocket watch Amanda had given him when they'd first begun dating. \"I think I can persuade her if I can only keep her in one place for a while...\" he said thoughtfully.\n\"You're not thinking about trying that hypnotism garbage again, are you?\" asked Amanda. \"Don't you realize how much rubbish that is?\"\n\"Shut up, Amanda. It works, and that's all there is to it. Believe me or not, as you will, but that doesn't change anything. And another thing: the Lady of the Lake isn't just a myth. There are too many references to her, to Arthur, and to the whole legend for it to be completely fictional. For that matter, it is widely believed that the legends are mostly based on fact. And I must have that amulet.\"\n\"Well, if it's that important to you, I think I heard Lucy was staying with Al for a while -- to help her settle down after her mom's death. There's a laugh. Everyone knows that he's liked her since college,\" said Amanda, with a grimace.\n\"Staying with Al, huh? Silly shit probably promised he'd protect her, too. What a pain...\" He cringed as Amanda washed out his wound a second time. \"Damn! Well, protection or none, I will have that buckle!\"\n\"Don't even think about hurting Albert, Tyre. I know you two haven't gotten along that well in the past few years, but we all had some great times together, back in school. I like him.\"\n\"I will do whatever I have to do to get what I want.\"\nAt that, Amanda rolled her eyes to the sky and stalked out of the room, taking the peroxide with her. Tyre sat looking at a red cotton ball. His leg smelled like disinfectant. `Good Lord...' He got up, and limped over to the door through which Amanda had left the room. He went to the medicine cabinet and removed a length of gauze bandage and some tape. He bound up his leg, and then headed painfully for the front door.\nAmanda called out, \"Don't take off yet, Tyre. I'm going with you.\"\nA few minutes later, they departed for Albert's house.\nLucy sat up, and saw Albert looking at her. He looked confused, like he always looked when she appeared while he was writing. \"Hello, Lucy...\" he began uncertainly, \"How long have you been here?\"\n\"Oh God... I don't know... I think I fell asleep.\" As she got a bit reoriented, she remembered the evening's events. \"Al? I wanted to talk to you about Tyre...\"\nHis confusion melted, as he focused full attention on the woman before him. \"What's up?\"\nShe told him about her encounter with Tyre, and then asked, \"What am I going to do about him? He's obviously not going to leave me alone until I give up Mother's belt buckle.\"\n\"Hmm... don't worry about Tyre, anyway. I'll take care of him. But why does he want the thing? I mean, I really can't see him wearing anything so...\"\n\"Watch it.\"\n\"...large. Can you think of any reason why he might want it?\"\nLucy thought of the events leading up to the evening's festivities. \"No, but he wants it badly. He offered to pay me a lot of money for it. I wonder why...\"\nHer contemplation was halted abruptly by a pounding on the door. \"Guess who...\" They went to the front door and Albert innocently called, \"Who is it?\"\n\"It's Tyre and Amanda,\" came a deep voice from outside. \"Is Lucy in there? I wanted to talk to her.\"\nLucy frantically shook her head no. Her eyes pleaded that Al not reveal her presence. He whispered to her, \"Don't worry; I'll take care of Tyre.\"\nThen he opened the door and saw Tyre leaning on Amanda. His leg was bandaged up tightly. \"God, Tyre...I haven't seen you forever! How've you been? I see you're still with Amanda...\" Al looked ruefully at the woman in question. \"Well, how can I help you?\"\nTyre replied, \"Actually, it's Lucy who can help me,\" He limped through the door, followed by Amanda. \"Have you thought about what I said, Lucy?\"\n\"What happened to your leg, Tyre?\" she asked innocently.\n\"Lucy...\"\n\"All right,\" she said, almost giggling, \"I told you before, Tyre. There are too many memories wrapped up in this. I can't just sell it to the highest bidder. Especially not to a buyer who won't say why he wants it.\"\n\"I'm afraid I won't take 'no' for an answer, Lucy.\" He moved toward her, reaching for her waist. Albert interposed his larger body between Tyre and Lucy.\n\"Sorry, Tyre, but I can't let you do that. If you want the buckle...\" At that he reached back and took it from Lucy's belt, which promptly fell to the floor. \"...You'll have to take it from me.\"\n\"Fine, then. If that's the way you want it-\"\nAmanda cut him off. \"Uh, Tyre, I don't think this is a very good idea...\"\n\"Wait a minute, Al.\" commanded Lucy. \"This isn't right. Give me the buckle, and I'll deal with Tyre.\"\nAl backed down, handing it to Lucy, with the final note: \"Tyre, you can't have the belt buckle. It belongs to Lucy and until you convince Lucy that she wants to sell it, you'll just have to do without..\"\n\"I think I can convince her...\" said Tyre, taking out an old pocket watch Amanda had given him when they first began dating. He set it to swinging and looked askance at Lucy, \"If the lady is willing?\"\n\"What do you have in mind?\" she looked straight into his eyes.\nTyre said, \"How about this: If, after ten minutes with you -- no contact of course -- I can convince you to sell me your bauble, then I will give you a substantial price for it. If after those same ten minutes you still insist on keeping it, then I will leave peaceably, and never again bother you about it.\"\nAlbert looked over at Amanda and winked. She barely suppressed a burst of laughter.\nLucy said, \"Fine. Does tomorrow night sound good to you?\"\nTyre nodded, \"Tomorrow night it is, then.\"\nAfter careful consideration, Lucy's hand settled on a blue dress. She brought it out and set it next to the red one on the bed. Looking at each in the mirror, she finally decided on the blue. `This will look great with Mother's belt buckle.' She replaced the red dress in her closet, and then began to put on the other. She chose a new pair of shoes, high heels the same color as her dress. The overall effect, once she had added a silver chain belt fastened by the moon buckle, was dazzling.\n\"Hey Al,\" she shouted, poking her head out into the hall, \"How do I look?\"\nHis head appeared around the corner, followed by the rest of his body. \"Why? Are you fishing for compliments?\" She glared playfully at him. \"You look fantastic. Is my tie straight?\"\nLucy spent a few minutes adjusting his black tie, and just as she finished, there was a familiar pounding on the front door. \"Showtime...\"\nAl opened the front door, exposing Tyre and Amanda, who came inside, shutting the door behind them. Amanda wore a gray slit dress which, though simple, brought out her figure beautifully. Tyre, on the other hand, was dressed all in black, his suit finely tailored to make the most of his slight build. He leaned upon an ebony cane which was topped by a gold carving of a dragon's head. His watch chain, hanging from its pocket, balanced out the ensemble.\nLucy maintained her composure, realizing that she struck quite an impressive figure herself. \"You look very nice, Tyre.\" She said, politely.\n\"So do you.\" He replied, careful to keep the awe out of his voice. Al and Amanda simply stared at the imposing couple.\nAfter what seemed an awfully long time, Al broke out of the trance. \"Well, you may as well join me in the kitchen, Amanda. I have a feeling these two want to be alone. Lucy, Why don't you take Tyre to the living room?\"\nAl's living room was not very large, but it was comfortable. The most prominent feature was an overstuffed couch. The brown upholstery had seen better days, but it was still functional. In front of that was an old but sturdy coffee table with the finish worn in places. There were a few more chairs on either side of the room, and the floor was covered by a rusty-orange carpet.\n\"Lucy, why don't you get comfortable on the couch. Stretch out...\"\n\"Tyre you promised that this would be no contact.\" She teased, but she did as he instructed. He sat, facing her, on the old coffee table.\n\"Hey Tyre, why do you want my belt buckle, anyhow?\" She asked, genuinely curious.\n\"I'd rather not say. You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" He dodged.\n\"Come on, Tyre, try me.\"\n\"Fine.\" He said, \"But you won't believe me. This so-called belt buckle that your mother left to you was actually a pendant worn at the bosom of the Lady of the Lake. I had hoped to add it to my collection of Druidic relics.\"\nLucy looked him straight in the eye and said, \"Bullshit.\" He stared right back into her eyes, but refused to comment. \"You aren't kidding, are you?\" She looked down at her waist and saw the amulet hanging there, but it seemed much heavier now.\nTyre cleared his throat, \"If we could get on with this...\"\n\"Right.\" Lucy looked over at him.\nHe took out his gold pocket watch, and began to swing it gently before Lucy's eyes. The two relaxed, and after a few moments, they had achieved a subtle rapport. Presently, Tyre began to whisper, \"You are more comfortable than you have ever been before...\"\nAlmost unconsciously, Lucy reached down and unfastened her belt. She raised the silver moon by the chain, and allowed it to follow the sleepy motion of the gold watch. \"Yes... comfortable... ever before...\" She whispered after him.\n\"You feel your desire to possess the Amulet of the Lady fading, blowing gently away like pollen on the breeze...\"\n\"...the breeze...\" Lucy slowly straightened her back up until she and Tyre both sat facing one another. Gold and silver were lowered, as man and woman rose. They stood, each staring into the other's eyes, she gripping the moon, he the dragon.\nBut to Tyre it seemed a staff. He saw before him, not a woman in a blue dress, but the Lady herself, blue gown flowing, almost as though in a breeze, her posture regal. Barely showing beneath the hem of her gown, a pair of stiletto heels poked their way into view. And he was Merlin, gripping his staff intensely, his black cloak fluttering.\nHer eyes bore deeply into his, and she said, \"No Tyre, I'm afraid it's your desire which has faded.\"\nBut it seemed to him that she had said, \"Dear Merlin... You've no power over me.\" And it occurred to him that she was right.\nBill Racicot is a sophomore stuck in Limbo because of a paperwork error in the school of the humanities at Carnegie Mellon University.

Grey and cold. Colder than cold. So cold that all you really notice is the dull, numb feeling that lives in your bones. It aches. A wind skitters down the pavement, blowing bits of charred paper with it. Some damnfool been trying to light a fire. Newly run, freezing, no roosts. You don't try to light fires on days like this. Days when the sleet and gritty rain fall out of the sky, and the wind drives it stinging into tattoos and raw scars. Crazed. On a day like this you huddle inside and pray that your roost has some heating coils.\n\"Nikathlin.\" Damn. Emrty calling me. Gotta go. Leave the relative safety of the stairs and dog out into that blinding, biting nastiness that pours out of the sky. Snapped day, wouldn't be out if I could help it. Bloody fool gang Heartbreakers from two belts over challenges. My bloody fool gang leader Mrikon accepts. Thrice snapped Easterners, should live in the Shattered Sector. But even crazed Northerners wouldn't be out on a day like this.\nFalling behind I am. Bunch of words be running through my mind. Like I'm telling a story. Happens to me every so often. Don't know what it is. I run up and after and settle in with the rest. Emrty's always after me for falling behind. The boy's got something against Westerners. \"Nikathlin,\" he's always saying, \"she's a crazy. Slacker. Got no soul.\" Got more soul than you, you thrice strung baboon. Baboon. Is a curse my father used to use when he was drunk. Don't know what it is, he probably didn't either.\nCrazy, the whole lot of them over here. We spent the night over at the Circles so that we could fight this gang. Stupid. Ain't nothing in fighting them. We aren't rivals, no one trespassed, no insult given or taken. No, Heartbreakers is a new gang. Are power crazed, want prestige. And Mrikon, he wants prestige, too. Wants to get noticed by the Five. Wants to be a scout, maybe Eastern Five himself. Tell you something, Mrikon honey, you don't get to be the Five by picking fights with every gang in Charn. You get to be a Five by having smarts. Hells, look at Alafn. It's almost safe for a legal down here, so long as they don't walk into a gang fight. Well, not really. They still get robbed and all, but they aren't hurt or killed. Not that legals were killed much before Alafn either. It brings the Song-dancers and the guard down on ya. But even gang runners are barely ever killed anymore. It's all Alafn, him and his precious human life. But it's good. I don't want to be killed myself. And all the protocol that goes along with it is good too. Formalizing all the unspoken rules. The challenges, the gangs never fighting two against one. You know, all that. And then the trashing of all of them when somebody does kill. Besides, running a gang into Northern or into the ground gives a gang a chance to work out its grief, rage, y'know, all the psych words and that stuff. With Mrikon for Five, Eastern'd be hell on wheels. That's another thing of my father's. Don't know what that one means either.\nWhat is with my mind this morning? I'm wandering much worse than I ever do, like I'm half drunk and Running to be Anglwick. Not even paying attention to where I'm going. I look about me and experience a slight shock. What on Charn are we doing over on Elista Belt. Then I remember, feeling like a damnfool. We're going on a raid. Another crazy thing to do on a day like this. Have you ever tried breaking into an underground warehouse when it's below zero out and you're on another gang's territory? Let me tell you, it is not a pleasant experience. Twice we've been jumped doing this. Once a window broke and three runners got cut up, one so bad that he took a fever and died. Damnfool was in the way anyways, broke the window and nearly brought the Song-Dancers down on us all. The gang whose territory the building was in gave us hell and four separate challenges for it. We won.\nEnough. Stop. Must try to concentrate on what's going on. I hate it when my mind does this. We cross over the rubble scattered streets. All gray, mostly plasticrete. No belts over here by Stores. These are the back ways, plasticrete and cement so that the huge antgrav trucks can get through them. This is where gang fights take place. Makes me jittery, so that my rod jumps about in my hand and I look about, always wary. Don't want to be jumped today. Got a raid and a challenge to go to.\nRaiding is a big pain in the rear. But it's either raid or steal. Raiding from Stores ain't real stealing. The way we figure, Stores has food for the whole city. It's where the Clans and the shops and the Song-Dancers all get their food. For the city. Well dammit, we are the city. We are the city's heartbeat, as Kira said, and the city would die without us. Who on Charn are you anyways, that I have to justify who I am and what I do to you? Let me tell you something, honey. I wasn't born into this life. I chose it. I was Clan Athlin. High Clan Athlin. I know what cake tastes like. I know what it's like to sleep in a real bed. I know what it's like to be legal and have luxuries and new clothes and points to spend. It sucks. This life may not have much by way of comfort and the pay is terrible and so is the food, but I love it.\nI don't know how to describe it to you. I mean, the life up there is crazy. Parties and protocol and testing and training, all in tribute to some kind of warped society. Being Clan, you may have privilege and money and the like, but your life ain't worth a dog's butt. Unless you're Clant. Being pure Athlin, they expect you to be Clant. Twelve years old I wasn't Clant yet, showed no sign of being Clant, was sick of being told I was Clant and didn't want to be Clant. So I ran. They tell you crazy stories. They say that the street children are gonna kill you. Yeah, they say it, but you know that a street kid don't kill no other kid. You know that the street children are out there. You know that if you can find a couple and if you got enough smarts you can survive. So you run. Like I did.\nI'm not going to tell you that the life isn't hard. It is. Damn hard. I almost died my first night out. Had the sense enough to bring some good clothes and some food. Was fool enough not to even think about getting myself a roost. Hells, didn't know anything about claims, barely even knew what they were. They came later. Almost starved to death before I learned to open the doors. That's what my job is here. Open the doors. Coming up soon, too. Can see the Stores building up ahead. Can always tell Stores from other buildings. Have patterns in colored tile or rock or some such embedded in the front of them. This one's blue with green, which makes it textiles and food. Weird that they mix 'em.\nGo down the stairs. Smooth cut stairs, like all new warehouses. Not pitted and worn like those of a roost. Down into a dark place, big enough for fourteen people. Dark that is, until one hits the plate for the lights. This a real new one, the lights not blown yet. Still bright and beautiful. I get like this, thinking about beautiful things, before I open the doors.\nThere are three of us who do it, me an' Jial an' Evenesh. Jial's also clan blood, high Clan Lin. The three of us stand triangle-like in the center of the space, me at the apex, them at the other two points. That's the way it is with us, they provide the raw power, I provide the focus. To do this, you have to reach out and feel in the door, feel the lock, feel the flow of 'lectricity through the lock and through the comp. Don't know how I do it, I just do. I just send my mind in there and feel the flow. All these little bits and pieces and I trace 'em back and when I get into the comp files I shift and start reading. And when I find a handprint that will open the lock, I feed it to the reader. And then wait. And pray to Kira and her Ghost and all the devils in Charn and whatever other power I can think up. Most times the door opens now. But sometimes it asks for a code. Then we have to break a window or the like.\nSo I just stand and wait, with a hand on each of my shoulders and my hands reaching out, fingertips to the door. With all the 'lectricity pouring in and out of me and making my blood feel like it's freezing. Until the little jumping bits finally slow and the door opens with a smooth click. Immediately comes Mrikon, leaping through the door before it's half open. Damnfool, not waiting to see if there be alarms and the like. Still, is good to get someone inside, in case the door closes again. Stays open this time, and Mrikon doesn't get fried, so we're safe for now.\nRaids are the most crazed part of this crazed gang. You get in and wander around, each person taking what he or she wants. Most have the good sense to split it up. One person gets breads, another meats, et cetera. You don't take too much on a gang raid. Only what you need to survive. Don't open too many crates either. The city knows that the street children steal from Stores. They compensate for it. But they get angry, start putting codes on the doors, if there are too many crates open. They can't ship 'em to shops that way. The shop keepers don't like it. In Clan Stores it don't matter too much. I can get into Athlin Stores easy. They still got my handprint on file there. Damn hard to get in otherwise. Clan's always keep the handprints of anyone in the Clan on file. The way they figure, we're still a part of the Clan. They don't really care if they find a street kid in Stores neither. Hells, they'd probably invite 'em home to dinner with 'em. The way they figure, you're probably Clan. With the security they got, you gotta be Clan to get inside the outer building. And they figure, someone who's Clan wouldn't bring another street kid in with 'em. And they're right. I wouldn't bring anybody else in with me 'less they were starving. Hey, I may be a street kid and all but I still got some loyalties left. If my Clan cares enough about me to think that I might need food, then I care enough not to feed it to any kid off the street.\nBut you can't live out of Clan Stores forever. Most of what they got is raw food. Weird and expensive food. Squid, pheasant, flour, spices, milk, the like. Unless you're lucky enough to have a roost with heating coils or a hotter you can patch in somewhere, that type of food ain't worth too much. No, when we raid, we take processed food. Precooked. We got a roost with coils over by the Wall but we don't get back that way all the time. Besides, is a good days walk from here to there. No, we take canned stuff. Precooked beans. Meats. Cheese. Applesauce. Thirst sticks. Drinks. The kind that's easily carried and more easily eaten. Hells, we don't got none of your fancy stuffs. Forks and plates and bowls and the like. A runner's got his knife and cooks his stew in a can. And when you're a fighter you got to have something that you can gulp down between dashes to and away.\nYou figure it out after a while. What gives you energy. What you can eat with your fingers. Ask ya something. Have you ever tried eating canned peas with your fingers in a span of five minutes? Not fun at all. Threw the can in the face of the first guy who came at me. Wiped my hands in the second guy's hair. It's things like that that teach you. Tell you, I never got peas again. Not good to waste your food like that.\nSo I wander about, pulling out food from open crates. Until we go back up, loaded carisaks in hand. Those we steal. Can't help stealing some things, and we don't steal those too often. Besides, carisaks be cheap.\nThe wind is worse than ever and smells of ashes. Can feel them scraping against my already raw skin. Blasted new must be really near. Rain's sleeting down and it works the grit in deeper until your scalp itches and water dribbles into your eyes. I draw my cloak closer about me but still the chill and the damp creep in until my clothes are all clammy and stick and make a body colder.\nAnd I have to fight in this? No thank you, Mrikon. You and your damned pride. Why can't you just not take the challenge. Likely the other gang isn't even going to show up! Bunch of damnfools we are, going out like this. The raid was okay, we needed the food. But even the devils in Charn wouldn't fight in weather like this.\nMrikon sends a couple of the youngers back with the food to the far North roost. The one with the heating coils. Lucky idiots. We, the ones who stay behind, stand about filling the pockets of cloak and coat with food. No knowing how long this fight will last. I cram flat tins of beans and sardines and flat slabs of cheese and a few thirst sticks into my pockets. Then I start eating bread, sourdough, that turns wet and gritty in my hand. Feel weighted down by all of the food. Cloak hangs like a dead weight with its pockets full and being wet as it is. 'Course it won't matter much in a fight, since we gen'rally shed them anyways. Is another good thing about the streets, we don't steal from each other. 'Cept in Northern, where life is crazy. The way we figure, if someone's got something, it's rightfully theirs. We all got precious little as it is. We all know, at least most of us do, what it's like to be without a cloak or food or roost for a night. You do it to someone else, they could as likely turn about and do it to you. You want a cloak bad enough, you go up to Calypso Sector, up by Anglwick, an' steal it. Where they got ten times what any legal citizen would need and leave lots of it lying about to take. Hells, sometimes they even leave it lying about in the trash piles. Ain't real stealing either, the way that we do it. Go at the right time and you'll find the deliveries, second hand clothes and the like, lying about for the taking. You know, the stuff for the schools. Happen every couple of weeks or so. Can nip in, or jump the trucks and grab ten cloaks if ya wanted them.\nThe schools. Damned but they scare me. Scare all of us. Have you heard what they say about those places? Iron bars. Lights on a timer. Like a prison. Only worse. 'Cause of how they treat you, and the things they make you do. And it doesn't matter if you be Clan or not, or if ya got family up above. Everyone goes, they say. And I don't want any of it. Their stuff. Don't want to be taken back up above and taught to conform, taught to be good, taught to be a Clant again. Are you a respectable citizen? Legal an' all? Got your own unit, a high paying job, wear color to Carnivals and look a like a funeral otherwise? Don't know. Could even be a Song-Dancer for all I know of you. But the Song-Dancers are as warped and twisted as the rest. Down here they say they eat street kids, but I know. Its power hungry, they are. They're the ones who invented the schools, say they need to clean up the city. Hah! They've forgotten everything about what being a Song-Dancer is. Didn't Kira say the street children are the heartbeat of the city? Hells, she created the Song-dancers out of the street children. We were the ones with the talent, even if we are grubby and don't live in finery at the center of the city. Times like this I think the Cult of Kira's right. That the Song-Dancers have forgotten their true purpose. And the Dar have come among us. And from the streets the power will arise and Kira will return to save us.\nBut then I think, there's got to be something working against the Song-Dancers at their core. Why haven't they gone and looked for all the roosts. Why haven't they sealed up all the old buildings and cleaned up Northern Eastern? In Northern that's easy to explain, because the place is the Wild Clardlem. It's ruled by the streets, and all the Administrators are Cultists anyways. But why hasn't anything been done about the rest of Clardlem? Someone still remembers and believes. And that's enough for me. Someday I'll go back up top. We all have to. After a while you just get too big to hide. And too tired to run. And they catch you. Oh we all go back, it's the way it's always been. Only a few survive here. In Northern a lot survive, but as I said before, Northern is the Wild Clardlem.\nAnd it's almost enough to be a street kid. To have the freedom. To know that someday, when you take your blood out of the claims and your claims out of the roost, some other street kid will find and claim it. It's like a strange legacy, passing on the roost from one to another. We got another common law here in the streets. You don't take nothing out that you didn't come in with. You came in naked, you go out naked. Everything else stays with the roost. You don't take no food with you either. Once you cross out, you got no right to the food gotten on a raid. You're a legal then honey, and you pay for your food like a good legal does. Only the street rat got the right to it free.\nHah! I sound like a damned elitist now. Don't mean it that way. But it's true. When you're legal you abide by the law. When you're a street kid you're below the law and above the law and within the law and you make your own laws. And the street is the one that makes 'em all. Oh, we may say that the Five make the laws, but the truth is, the streets form what must be law. And it works. Better than anything they got up there it works. Getting close to the fight, and getting jittery I am. Almost wish I had been sent back with the youngers to the roost. But I always get this way before a fight. The damp and ash just make it worse.\nTake a little bit of metal out of my pocket and hold it in my hand. Little silver buckle, engraved with my name and roses. Is all I got left from when I left Athlin. Had it since I was a baby. Only thing I couldn't part with. Call me superstitious, but it's my luck piece. Kill me if I lost it. So I just walk along at the back of the gang and feel the metal grow warm in my hand. And after a while I put it away, tying it back into my clothes.\nGetting jittery now, all of us. There's the slight scrape of steel and rods glint dully in the air. This is the time where we are truly together as a gang. It is now, and only now that I can say that I love each and every one of them more than anything in the world. Each and every one of the damnfools, even Mrikon himself, damn the bastard. We stand now, jittery and watchful, waiting for the other gang.\nThey're not going to show, I think. And then they do show, the lot of them slinking out of the shadows like ghosts. Their leader goes through the ritual re-issuing of the challenge. The words pour through my mind and are gone, and so is Mrikon's answer. Everything moves more slowly, the fall back and disperse, arranging ourselves, the initial surge forward, everything as if it were moving through molasses. I see two runners leaping forward, clashing, falling back, then another and another, until finally my own body tenses and leaps and joins in with the fight. I move, slashing and parrying and punching and kicking and leaping. Until the whole array of us seems like some strange parody of a dance.\nWe don't call our fights anything fancy. They're just fights, no rumbles, smashing, all that stuff. But to me at times like this, it seems that we should call them dances. Street dances. The dances of the street, like those of the Song-Dancers up above.\nSo I move, dancing through molasses like I always do. Guy comes up, slash with the left, punch with the right and then leap away. Always like this, all of us cutting, twisting, never killing. Living by Alafn's law. Trip, and hit the ground rolling. And another blade comes down and hits the ground where I was in a shower of sparks. Someone screams, we're all screaming. And I think, I know that voice, and slash at someone's legs. And hear the scream again. And suddenly everything is snapping back into real time and I'm sent reeling back from remembrance as I hear them screaming a name.\n\"Graf!\" they yell. \"Graf!\" And then I burst into motion, fighting like a crazy woman, pressing towards that voice. Graf, my baby brother. Grafa. And since this isn't getting me anywhere I stop in the middle of the fight.\n\"GRATHATHLIN!\" I cry out. Want to kick myself, feeling like a damnfool. The fight freezes and the runners turn, all staring at me. Nikathlin, you crazy, I say to myself. Now what will they think of you. Screaming out high Clan names into the middle of a fight. But then a dark-haired boy with too light eyes comes leaping down out of somewhere, staring wildly about him. He sees me and those eyes light up in recognition.\n\"Niki!\" he yells. And then we're leaping around each other, hugging and taunting and babbling away like all brothers and sisters.\n\"Kira's Ghost but you've grown, boy,\" I say finally. \"You were a small scrawny thing when I left.\"\nHe looks down at me from his huge height, and I am not a short girl. \"That was five years ago,\" he says. \"I'm thirteen now.\"\n\"Damn big old lug of thirteen you be.\" And we laugh, remembering the times we used to have. And all the while the gangs stare, and finally slink off to fight it out somewhere else.\n\"Dammit Grafa,\" I say then, \"why did you run? You're something to the Clan. You're Clant.\" Graf. We'd always called him that. Ever since he was a baby and couldn't say Grath.\n\"Didn't you know, Nik?\" he asks. \"They never registered me as Clant. I don't look right to be a Clant. Clant's s'posed to have light hair and dark eyebrows and the ears. Hells, I have the ears, but not the right coloring. You got the right coloring---\"\n\"But not the ears or the voice nor the talent for it,\" I break in. Was sick of being told I look right to be a Clant. \"They're just stupid. You had all the talent. You could even dance.\"\n\"'Sides,\" he goes on, \"life at Athlin was getting too crazy without you and Rika and Shi. Rika left two years after you, and Shia three. Dad doesn't talk or do much anymore. And Old Father's always talking about there not being anymore Clants being born. 'Bout a month ago I couldn't take it anymore and I just got out of there. Most of the other side have left, too. Hells, most of high Clan Athlin's children be in the streets now. Except for the babies. And Mikal.\"\nMikal. Haven't thought about Mikal in years. Boy must be like to twenty years old now, maybe older. And I feel a queer sort of ache rise up in my throat, like something half forgotten.\n\"Mikal never did leave,\" says Graf, \"not even when most of that side had left and it was only him and the babies left. He still talks about you, you know. But enough. Tell me what has happened to you. Tell me about the streets.\"\nSo I tell him. Tell him what I know. Tell him about Alafn and how to make a claim and blood bonding. Tell him how I open the doors. Tell him about living in Northern and all the things I've done since I left. Carnivals and fights and old scars and the meaning of the tattoo high on my left cheekbone.\nAnd so we talk and talk. And finally we part, each going back through the chill, grey rain to our respective gangs. Perhaps never to see each other again.\nAnd so I sit here in my corner. Hold the silver clasp in my hand and think. Think about the four of us scattered and running about the streets. Think about the rest of them running also. Think about what Graf said about Daddy and Old Father and Mikal. And just sit and think for a while.\nSometimes I miss 'em. Times like this I miss 'em the worst. Me sitting over here in my corner and them all over there. Laughing and talking. I'll always be the misfit in this crazy gang. Always the crazy Westerner.\nSometimes I think about going back. Just for a little while. Tonight I think I will.\nJae Brim is a student at the Alternative Community School in Ithaca, New\nYork.

A soft whirr sounded from inside the EMDA, and a drawer popped out containing a set of pens. Bremmer selected one, and used it to scribble on the set of technical diagrams that littered his desk. Pressing another button, he replaced the pen in the drawer. The EMDA acknowledged the weight, said \"Thank you,\" softly, and closed. Bremmer sighed, and lay back.\n\"Thank you,\" said the EMDA softly. Bremmer sat up quickly.\n\"Thank you,\" it said, a bit more emphatically. A drawer in its side popped open. Bremmer removed one of the coins that lay there, replaced it. The drawer slid closed.\n\"Thank you,\" the EMDA said. Bremmer waited. There was no sound from the EMDA. He relaxed.\n\"Thank you,\" the EMDA said implacably.\nThe door behind Bremmer opened, and Linda, the office mailwoman, walked in. Digging through a basket of mail, she handed him several letters.\n\"Thank you,\" said Bremmer and the EMDA simultaneously. Linda's eyebrows rose, and she smiled. Bremmer opened his mouth to say something.\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" the EMDA said in the same quiet tone which Bremmer was beginning to associate with dying rodents. The two of them looked at it in shock. All along the plastic device, drawers were opening and closing with wild abandon. The EMDA began to spin, slowly at first, then faster as it apparently gained courage. Small objects began working themselves lose from its drawers and hurtling around the room. Linda, standing, avoided the first few, then as the tumult began to fill the air, she dived, pulling Bremmer with her. Seconds later, a letter opener went through the space where she had been standing. Crossing the room in a metallic flash, it impaled itself with a loud thunk over the door. Bremmer's Home Wonders Associates sign dropped from the wall to the floor with a crystalline crash. Bremmer waited for several seconds. The letter opener quivered in the wall, but there was no sound; the myriad airborne objects appeared to have settled. Carefully, he raised his head.\n\"Thank you,\" said the EMDA. Bremmer reached around the back of the desk and unplugged it from the wall.\n\"Tha-\" said the EMDA concisely. The two people on the floor looked at each other for a few seconds, then stood up. Bremmer blushed slightly.\n\"It has a few bugs yet.\"\n\"A few,\" Linda agreed, laughing. She turned and left, then popped her head back in. \"You're welcome.\" she said to the EMDA.\nBremmer walked over to the door, removed his letter opener from the doorframe, and began the task of cleaning up his room.\nA week or so later, Michelson plugged in the EMDA and looked at Bremmer.\n\"Linda was telling me about this thing's homicidal tendencies,\" he commented. Bremmer laughed shortly.\n\"It's fixed, now. Never fear.\"\n\"Then why are you crossing your fingers?\"\nBremmer remained silent, and pushed the EMDA button. A drawer spun to him and slid open. Michelson removed a pen, held it a moment, and put it back. The drawer closed.\n\"Thank you,\" said the EMDA in a completely re-engineered voice. Nothing else happened.\nBremmer let his breath out slowly. Michelson smiled.\n\"Nice job, Bremmer,\" he said. \"This is just what Home Wonders needs to boost sales. It's polite, convenient, and helps organize to boot. Let's see Computer Home Innovations beat this one!\"\nBremmer bowed slowly, once, expecting the EMDA to thank him at any minute. It did not. \"Thank you,\" he said, unaccompanied. He shook Michelson's proffered hand, then handed the EMDA to him. The older man left, carrying it.\nBremmer turned and looked out his window. From his forty-third floor window, he could see the entire city spread out below him, blotted only by the Computer Home Innovations tower six blocks away, it's dark mirrored steel reflecting the white mirrored lime of the Home Wonders Associates building. If ever he was on top of the world, it was now. The EMDA would give him world-wide fame, the promotion that had landed on his desk that morning would seal his financial security, even in the unlikely event that he retired next year as was his right. His wife had recovered her health, his son had called earlier that week to announce the arrival of their first granddaughter. Everything in the world was bright.\nHe was very, very worried.\nCHI's EMDA appeared on the market only a day after HWA's. Bremmer had been completely unaware that the rival company had even been working on such a thing, even more surprised when he had gone home and seen CHI's commercial on television. But all in all he was fairly happy; HWA's EMDA, HIS EMDA, was by far the superior product, and the consumers seemed aware of this. (There were even rumors that the CHI EMDA had a habit of flying into \"Thank you\" fits and hurling their contents over a wide area. This was never reported with an HWA EMDA.)\nSo the next week it was with particular surprise that Bremmer learned that sales on his EMDA had almost ceased, and CHI's EMDAs were in so much demand they couldn't be kept in stock.\nBremmer was sitting around his desk one morning moping and playing with a CHI EMDA, trying to see what advantages it had. Linda entered to hand him his daily mail, stood behind him for a while and watched.\nThe CHI EMDA was a roughly rectangular lump, tastefully decorated in a mottled camouflage pattern of greens and browns. Six buttons were spaced unevenly around the outside, and a power cord snaked off the back. Bremmer poked at a button; it fell off. He spun the device, pressed another. A drawer slid out of the lump about halfway from the top. As the drawer reached its fullest open position, the entire EMDA overbalanced and rolled until it rested on it. With a laugh, Linda reached over his shoulder and pressed still another button. Another drawer snapped all the way out, ending its flight about six feet away. She flinched, pulled her arm away.\n\"Must be a defective one.\"\nBremmer shook his head. \"Nope. It's the fourth one we've bought. They're all like that, or worse. But CHI has sold almost a million of these things in a few days. I can't understand it.\"\nHe stood up and walked to the window. Linda followed; together they looked over at the dark tower of Computer Home Innovations. They continued to stare for several silent minutes, until a small black object detached itself from the top of the CHI tower and lifted into the air. Bremmer looked at it curiously.\n\"What is that thing? It's too big to be a bird, but I can't see it very well from here.\"\nLinda shook her head to show an equal lack of knowledge. Bremmer returned to his desk and pressed a button on his HWA EMDA. The sleek machine opened a drawer; within lay a pair of HWA Golf Goggles. Bremmer slid them on.\nA brilliant red display appeared in front of him, flashing columns of figures which completely obscured his view. After a second, the numbers stopped and the words \"RECOMMENDED CLUB SELECTION: NINE IRON\" appeared. In frustration, Bremmer thumbed the switch that shut off the golf computer, and spun the magnification dial.\nWith the goggles, Bremmer examined the creature which had left the CHI tower. Six foot leathery wings beat rapidly, but behind them lay a relatively humanoid figure, with a human face. The creature, whatever it was, carried a pitchfork in one of its short, clawed arms. Bremmer attempted to increase the magnification, but the words \"RECOMMENDED CLUB SELECTION: 1 WOOD\" suddenly obscured his vision, and by the time he managed to kill the computer again, the creature had vanished from view.\nHe described it to Linda, who shook her head and shrugged. \"Never heard of anything like it. Maybe its somebody's pet.\"\n\"Some pet,\" Bremmer commented.\nLinda was back after lunch, and dropped a sheaf of computer printouts on his desk along with the mail. Bremmer glanced at them briefly, then more carefully as an illustration on the top caught his attention. It was a carefully drawn dot-matrix image of the creature he had seen the day before. Dropping the rest of the mail into the HWA Artificially Intelligent Mail Reader, he grabbed the sheaf and turned to Linda in surprise.\n\"That's it! Where'd you find it?\"\nShe smiled. \"At the library. Under `S' for `Demon'. That's what you've got there-- a full-fledged Inferno Demon. The pitchfork's a dead giveaway, or so they say.\"\n\"But how did CHI get one? Where can we get one? And what the Hell's a magic demon doing in modern day New York?\" He stopped as he realized he wasn't making sense.\n\"No, not Hell. Inferno. I think it's some sort of Agnostic religious place. In any case, obtaining one is very easy, the spell is listed in the book. But more interesting is what they can do!\"\nBremmer paged through the sheaf until he reached a page covered in the glowing, speckled ink of a HWA Highlighter pen. The first words on the page caught his eye: \"capable of mass mind control.\"\n\"So that's how CHI is selling their EMDA!\" He put the sheaf down. \"So how do we get rid of it?\"\nLinda shrugged. \"It's not in there. Only the spell to summon one.\"\nThere was an explosion behind them as the Artificially Intelligent Mail Reader caught fire. Bremmer grabbed a plastic bucket of water he kept under his desk for just such emergencies as Linda pulled the HWA Fire-B-Gone fire extinguisher off the wall. Putting her finger through the trigger, she began sqeezing it rapidly. With each pull, a thin trickle of water dripped from the Fire-B-Gone. She threw it aside in frustration just as Bremmer hurled his bucket onto the Mail Reader. Thick clouds of steam filled the air, and the two of them sank down to the floor to avoid the mist...\nJust as the Fire-B-Gone really began to shoot. Lying on its side, the large tank began to spin under the pressure of the watery foam now spraying from its nozzle. Faster and faster it spun, coating the room in white suds before its tank finally ran empty and it slowed to a stop.\nBremmer and Linda stared at one another for a few moments. Silently Linda got up and left the room, leaving a dripping trail behind. Bremmer stood and shook himself off, the reached for his HWA Automatic Drying Unit. Before turning it on he reconsidered and sat down at the desk, still dripping.\nCarefully, so that the now-wet paper wouldn't fall apart, he turned to the page containing the summoning spell, and read it carefully. There were a number of long magic words and warnings of dire consequences if they were spoken incorrectly, and a list of ingredients to be mixed together to form an ink with which to draw a pentegram. Bremmer grimaced as he read the list; CHI had broken dozens of laws, including murder several times, to come up with all of these items. Even just the list of creatures from which vital internal organs were required was substantial.\n\"So much for summoning one ourselves,\" he said aloud to himself. But the glimmerings of an idea touched his mind, and he grabbed a sheet of sodden paper and began to write furiously a list of items he might need.\nBy the next day, he had assembled his materials, and, by the time Linda arrived with his mail, he was busy stirring things together in a large cauldron in the center of the room. She blinked and shook her head as she entered, then looked at him curiously. He looked up.\n\"Root beer, powdered daisies and rose petals, milk, sugar, baking powder, mustard, ketchup, honey, chalk dust...\" Bremmer continued listing off items as he placed them into the cauldron. When he finally finished, he brushed off his hands and stood.\n\"All the warnings in the spell description are about the words, not the pentagram ink, so I can't imagine that it makes a whole lot of difference what goes in there. Probably that stuff is just there to deter small children from playing with it.\"\nLinda was unimpressed with his logic. \"What if you're wrong? This is a demon that you're playing with. Somebody could get hurt -- clawed or mauled or eaten or something.\" She paused. \"Why do you want to summon a demon, anyway?\"\nBremmer smiled. \"I don't want to summon one, I want to dispel one. It says there that a demon can only be called once in a thousand years, so if I can make it go back wherever it came from, CHI won't be able to get it again. And it won't eat me; I think that it's a vegetarian.\"\nLinda just shook her head as Bremmer carefully dipped a paintbrush in the rose-scented mix he had just created and painted several lines on the floor.\nLinda watched, then spoke. \"Isn't a pentagram supposed to have five sides?\"\nBremmer counted quickly. \"Five, six, what's the difference? I'm not going to give it time to count, anyway.\"\n\"I'm beginning to understand why nothing at HWA works correctly,\" she muttered under her breath, but Bremmer was far too busy to pay attention to her.\n\"All right,\" he said at last. \"Now all we have to do is get it into the pentagram.\"\nLinda smiled. \"How about just sending it an invitation?\"\nBremmer narrowed his eyes. \"Don't be stupid.\" He picked up a box behind him, and took off the lid with a flourish. \"Devil's-food cake,\" he announced proudly. He placed the burned mass in the center of the pentagram, and sat down in the desk chair. \"Now we wait.\"\nThey didn't wait long. Within a minute, the window shattered, and the demon swept down into the pentagram. Pulling a knife from its back pocket, it began cutting the cake into bite-sized morsels, paying no attention whatsoever to the two people in the room. Bremmer grabbed the sheaf of papers from his desk.\n\"Where did you find a dispelling spell?\" Linda whispered.\n\"I didn't,\" Bremmer said. \"I'm just going to try reading these words backwards.\"\nLinda choked and began looking for an exit, but the demon was between her and the door, stabbing little chunks of cake on the tines of its pitchfork and gobbling them off. Bremmer began to read.\nSeconds went by, as the demon finished the cake and Bremmer's words droned on. Finally, the creature in the pentagram looked up, its eyes widening as it realized what Bremmer was doing. It began to speak as well, its speech high and fast. Various pictures on the walls around the room began to shake. Bremmer sped up his reading, and pronounced the final syllable loudly and clearly. A trap door opened beneath the the demon, and it disappeared in a roar of flames.\nThe pictures detached themselves from the wall, hovering menacingly in the air, and were slowly joined by the books from the shelves. Bremmer thought quickly as they began weaving fast, quick patterns in the air, the books opening and closing rapidly, making a loud drumbeat sound. Suddenly, an idea occured to him. Opening his desk drawer, he lifted out an HWA EMDA, labeled \"Prototype\" in large letters. Setting it on the desk, he pushed its button until all the drawers popped open.\nThe books and photographs approached nearer, leisurely, joined now by the sharp, jagged fragments of the shattered window.\nBremmer gestured to Linda to plug the EMDA in, then lifted a large dish of pennies off of the top of the desk. He poured as many pennies as would fit into each drawer. The drawers snapped shut.\n\"Thank you,\" the EMDA said in a dying-rodent voice. Linda's eyes widened at the sound, but she grabbed two HMA Fly-Die Flyswatters, and handed one to Bremmer. He accepted it. \"Thank you,\" said the EMDA.\nThe two of them began beating at the aerial assault, the wildly gyrating Fly-Die swatters like living things in their grasp, spinning, slapping, and mechanically sneaking up on the attacking items.\n\"Thank you,\" the EMDA said after a brief pause.\nThe glass now tore at their arms, and the pictures battered incessantly at them. The books, hanging back, kept up the steady drumbeat. Blood began to flow from dozens of scratches.\n\"ThankyouThankyouThankyouThankyouThank...\" said the EMDA quietly. Bremmer grabbed Linda and the two of them dropped to the floor just as the EMDA began to spin. As it reached its maximum velocity, the drawers began to pop open, and a cloud of swift, heavy coins filled the air, forcing the glass, pictures, and books to slam into one another and the walls. A steady drone of \"Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou\" was kept up the whole time, but within seconds the flying army was gone.\nLinda pulled the plug on the raving EMDA. Slowly, the two of them stood up, stepping carefully across the destroyed room to the now-glassless window.\n\"Look!\" Linda said, pointing. Bremmer looked.\nThe dark, foreboding tower of CHI was dark no longer. Every trace of glass in the building shimmered and exploded outward, shimmering like a billion diamonds in the sun, then vanished into thin air. Moments later, the entire structure began to sink into the ground, losing a story or so every second until the building had completely vanished.\n\"They must have built the skyscraper using the demon's magic. I guess it wasn't prefab after all.\"\nBremmer restrained a comment as a buzzer somewhere signalled that it was time for lunch. The two of them made their way carefully toward the dented, battered door.\nWhen they got there, Bremmer paused, then returned to his desk. Opening a drawer, he dug for a few moments and found what he was looking for; he placed the \"Maid: Please make up this room now\" sign on the door as he left.\nChristopher Kempke is a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University.

Large, round, intelligent eyes, with a bright, sparkling smile. Not the type of girl a man dreams of, but the type of dream a man searches for. Roger wasn't much for dreaming though. Day in day out his life was always constant, but his eyes held the gleam of the sun in the middle of the day. No one could stay in that sun long.\n\"Roger, I want you to meet Cheryl Wilson. She is starting work here today. I thought I would put her next to you and have you help her get adjusted. Cheryl, Roger is one of the best data entry clerks we have. If you have any questions, he should be able to answer them, and I will be meeting with you this afternoon to handle the left over paperwork; welcome aboard.\"\n\"Nice to meet you, Cheryl. If there's anything I can help you with please let me know,\" Roger stammered out, \"I know what its like to be new here, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.\"\nThey worked side by side through the next six weeks. Roger worked for a large multinational corporation, just one insignificant person out of thousands in this building alone. Day in and day out he entered data into the massive computers. His job never varied, each day it was the same routine: type, check, type, check, type, check. Cheryl caught on quickly and soon was working at the same rate as Roger. They didn't talk much, no one talked much. An occasional nod, a quiet hello, sometimes a smile; that was life on the 93rd floor.\nThe room they worked in was long and wide, a gymnasium of office space. In small cubicles, over four-hundred data processors entered everything from survey data to insurance claims. Roger had spent the past six months of his life typing in the same repair bill, each time with different numbers and different names.\n\"Roger, what are you doing this evening?\" Cheryl asked with a flip of her hair as she was getting her coat on, her question slicing through the bustle of the office at quitting time.\n\"Not much. Probably watch T.V. and go to bed early.\" Roger said with the tiredness of someone who had been doing the same thing for just a little too long.\n\"Why don't you come over to my place for dinner. I don't feel like eating alone tonight. I have some steaks and some nice wine, it should make a pleasant dinner.\"\nRoger began to swell with thoughts of what this could spell the beginning of. \"I would love to. What time would you like me there?\"\n\"Here's my address. Lets see... I need some time to shower and change. Why don't you make it eight o'clock? Is that ok?\"\n\"Great! Do you want me to bring anything? Dessert?\"\n\"Sure, that sounds fine. Whatever you like, as long as it doesn't have bananas in it.\"\n\"Ok. I'll see you at eight.\"\nRoger's mind began to race. He had nothing to wear, he had nothing to talk about. Literally, he was nothing. He stopped after work at a department store and bought an outfit that would go with the evening. He felt like a young kid going on a first date. His heart was racing, his head was spinning. For twenty-eight, he didn't have a lot of experience with women; he wasn't quite a virgin but he wasn't Mr.~Smooth either. He was just like every other person, full of fear of true intimacy, full of confusion, full of life.\nHe showed up at three minutes to eight. She was dressed in a simple black dress; just a hint of romance was in the air. Dinner was served on the only china in the house. The wine was a bit sour, the meat a bit fresh. But it was the best dinner Roger had eaten in years. They ate slowly. Conversation was strange, at first, but after a while seemed natural.\n\"How long have you lived in the city, Roger?\" She asked glad that she didn't start talking about the weather.\n\"Oh, lets see... about 5 years. I moved here right after school.\"\n\"It's so strange to live here, for me. I went to school in Kansas and I've spent most of my life in small towns. I don't think I was quite ready for the anomie that the city causes.\"\n\"Yeah, at first it takes some getting used to but that's the fun part. What kills you here is the constant nasal drone, the day-in-day-out sameness. You would think that in a big city, life would never get dull, but it does, terribly dull.\"\n\"Is your life terribly dull?\" She said with a sarcastic smirk as she cleared the table and started to fix the dessert.\n\"Oh yes, terribly,\" he replied not realizing her sarcasm, \"Sometimes, nothing ever seems to happen at all.\"\nShe put on some light instrumental jazz, filling the small apartment with a kind of high-tech warmth. As the music began to play he looked into her eyes and knew then that something had already happened between the two of them. They spent that night together, two people---one being.\nThey got married six months later and moved into a small family starter apartment on the south side of town. Life was finally going like it is supposed to. At last, Roger had something to live for, a reason to live in a world without any reason. He was put in charge of the data entry division and Cheryl quit work to have children. It was the classic American dream.\nOn August 16, 2005, his son was born. The nine months had been an experience that neither parent would forget. The company Roger worked for was having major problems in the global market place, and Roger couldn't sleep some nights from the tension at work. Day in and day out it was his wife's face that gave him the strength to get through the day. Fortunately the pregnancy went fine. Roger looked in his newborn son's eyes for a glimmer of hope. His own emptiness answered him back.\nTime passed, his son grew, his life settled. Things were the same as they had always been for beginning families. It was a kind of exile from the real world, where the only things that count live under your own roof, the brightness of his wife's smile when the money was tight, the gleam in his son's eye when he found out something new about the world, and a widening isolation from striving for anything new, a life upon the stagnant water.\nA Sudden Rain\nOn Roger's 33th birthday he went to work, just like he always did. Each morning waking up at seven to catch the shuttle into town. Each morning kissing his wife on the forehead as he left for work. Each day buying the paper at the paper stand. Each day the same as the last. At the end of work that day Roger took the Fenston-Hampton mag-lev train home. Sitting on the hard bench staring out into the landscape, Roger just waited. His eyes didn't even blink when the computer called his stop. He crossed his legs and kept riding. Soon the airport stop was called. By now the train was nearly empty, Roger was one of about five people left. From the moment he stepped off the train, his hair blowing in the high wind out near the airport, he always looked toward the ground while walking into the terminal. He went to the nearest airline desk, placing his briefcase on the ground.\n\"I would like a ticket on the 8pm moon shuttle.\" he said with out a pause.\n\"Very good sir, and when will you be returning?\" the flight clerk asked.\n\"One-way.\"\n\"And how many bags will you be checking today?\"\n\"None.\"\n\"All right sir, thats one way to the moon on flight 564 leaving at 8pm arriving on luna station at 1am. That will be $456.34, can I get your name and how you be paying for this?\"\n\"The name is Roger Lansta, and I will be paying cash.\"\nAs he was sitting in the terminal, molded into a little plastic chair, mindlessly staring out into space, he couldn't even focus on what he was doing. In one of the corners of the terminal, a conversation was taking place between a decrepit bag lady and a retarded man in a wheelchair. For the past thirty minutes, the bag lady had been making her psychotic way around the terminal, talking into space about her non-existent life and her opinions on the way the world should be. Most people just ignored her, but the poor man in the wheelchair seemed to welcome her company. Roger's ship would board soon. All he had to do was manage to sit still just a little while longer.\n\"I used to be a big star. I did tons of movies. I was famous.\" the poor woman claimed.\n\"I like movies. Like pretty pictures.\" the man in the wheelchair answered.\n\"But my real job was as a spy, I used to be undercover for the CIA. I traveled all over the world. But I'm retired now.\"\n\"I had a job. Good job, very good.\"\n\"You know what they have done to the trains? You know when they painted them the new colors? That was my idea. I have many friends in city hall,\" the woman continued without even noticing that the man in the wheelchair.\nRoger boarded the ship and sat down in his seat. He closed his eyes and listened to the roar of the ship as it broke free from Earth's gravity. His mind was a complete blank, if he was to think but one thought his whole world would have collapsed like a red star. As the ship entered orbit around Earth, he saw the edge of the sun pouring down on the ship, burning his eyes. Somewhere in the dark void of space, he gave up what was left of his life.\nMoonlight\n\"What am I doing here? I'm thousands of miles from my family, from my home, my wife, my child. Why am I here?\" Roger screamed into the silent walls of his mind, but he did not leave. His inner thoughts were now racing, trying to explain his actions. \"I can't focus on my life any more. I can't tell I am alive. To feel you're alive you must sometimes break the glass. You can't tell you're anything, unless you know what it's like to be nothing.\" The inner argument didn't help his soul, but the screaming did tire him to sleep. The nights did not pass easily, but he did not leave, he did not call home.\nRoger took a job, processing low gravity metal alloys. The work was long and hard, sweating in a weightless shop twelve hours a day, coming home to a bare little hovel, eating a meager dinner, passing out only to find morning once again. Two years passed, Roger slowly built a life out of the nothing of the moon. Living space on the moon was cheap, as was everything else---food, clothes, entertainment, but there was a price---constant work.\n\"If there is a hell, this must have been the model it's based on.\" Roger often said to his co-workers. But in this constant pain, there was something that called to Roger. He didn't like living here, but he didn't want to leave, yet.\nThe work did its damage to Roger, and in time he was a living corpse. He had lost thirty pounds and did not sleep regularly anymore. Two more years went by. Roger outlasted everyone he knew. The work became routine. Get up in the morning, work, go to sleep at night. The demons that hunted Roger had finally left him.\n\"Roger, Roger..., ROGER! Look at you. Your dead tired, your not doing us a bit of good here. I want you to go home and sleep. Go home Roger, come back tomorrow.\" His boss was becoming worried about Roger's health.\n\"I'm ok. Just tired. So tired. I can't rest, though --- can't. I have to keep going.\" Roger shook his head a few times and ran his hands through his hair. \"I'm fine. I can go a few more hours, I just dozed off a bit.\"\n\"Roger, you nearly ran that drill press through your hand. If you don't leave I'm gonna have to call security. Don't make me do that. Go home.\"\n\"Ok. Ok. But I still think I'm fine. I'm fine.\"\nSea of Rains\nOne night a few weeks later at about 4 AM, with a fire burning through his blood, Roger ran out into the the night. Stealing a moon buggy and driving in a blind fear into the Mare Imbrium. He finally stopped and stared into the vast depths of space. Up above were the stars glowing, tiny embers piercing the veil of darkness. Roger still felt the pulling at his soul, the same force that had driven him to abandon his family, abandon himself. It was hungry again. A call across the universe, one he had to answer.\nThe next night he left on an outbound ship. The ship was the `MakeFast', a crew of two hundred headed for the outer colonies just beyond Alpha Centauri. It would take over six years to make it to the first planet, even with the Tesser propulsion drive. But on ships like this they always needed able hands, so Roger had no trouble getting on board. Once again, his life took the form of endless boredom.\n\"Did you hear about Zebob getting crunched in the gateway yesterday,\" One of Rogers friends mentioned.\n\"Yeah, I heard.\"\n\"Damn shame if you ask me, but he was a bit of a daredevil.\"\n\"Daredevil? Well yes I guess he was. But I don't think he would have felt it was a shame. It would have been a real shame if it had been an accident. Zeb never did like fate. He really believe that he was the master of the universe. Probably why he was so wild.\"\n\"But now he's dead. All he had to do was wear the safety rig. But no! He wasn't going to do something that pansy. Always the show-off.\"\n\"He was no more a show-off then the next guy. He really believe that his life was his. He wanted that thrill. It was his life and he ended it. I envy him. He lived his life and he caused his death, nothing could be simpler. It was pure.\"\nRoger's friend stared at him for a short time, in disbelief. \"Whatever you say Roger, but its still a shame.\"\nSix years passed on board the `MakeFast'. Roger felt at peace, for some reason, with the blank and empty dark sky. He often asked himself how the first deep space explorers must have felt, to meet this void head on, and not flinch. The first planet that the ship came upon was quite a welcome sight for the crew. The planet looked like it would provide plenty of ore and other rare materials and could be savaged for a few years before moving on. The ship was put into a permanent orbit and a small colony was put on the planet. The atmosphere was breathable, and there was some soil that could be cultivated. The change to planet life didn't take all that long and, once again, the patterns of a stable life had begun.\nRoger was placed in charge of a small mining group that worked in the mountains near the colony. The work was not as hard as mining on the moon had been and the ores were plentiful. Time went on. Each day another tussle with the world, each night a fitful sleep. Roger was no longer a young man, running from the world. Each night he searched the heavens, every day he longed to move on.\nSunburn\nKnowing that he couldn't stay put on this planet much longer, he began to gather up supplies in order to leave. The ship had four scout vehicles that could be driven by one person, with the help of the onboard computers. It took him nearly a month to gather enough food and equipment to risk stealing one the the scouts, but he was once again determined to move on.\nOne night, Roger took the scout ship `MakeShort'. The ship had enough fuel and food to last for about a year if he didn't eat or drink much. This part of the galaxy was filled with stars and planets that were within a few months of each other. Roger skipped around the galaxy for about ten months, when he came upon a solar system with two suns. The suns were orbited by four planets, all quite large compared to the Earth. Roger set down on the most hospitable of the four but in a system with two suns, hospitable meant little more than looked like it had some atmosphere. Light years form reality and unable to leave, Roger made his home once again.\nDry Rain\nAfter two months, all the water was gone. Roger realized for the first time that his death was coming. It was something that he had resigned himself to on the day he had left earth. His restless nature had driven him, on beyond all reason, into the vast depths of space, and now to the end of his world. He ran out into the desert for four days, always moving forward, refusing to stop for more than short breaks, driven by some need that only he could understand. He made his last stand on a hilltop in the middle of a burning sea of sand and wind.\nHe stood up. His ragged clothes flapping in the wind on top of the dune. His whole body scorched red from the sun. He looked into the bright light and for the first time in years, smiled. His face was grim and determined. His body was thin and weak, but he stood straight up. The sand swirled around him as his body took its last breath. As he feel forward into the sand, his face still kept that gaunt look of irresolute determination to not stand still. Even as the sand began to mutate his body, that look remained, unchanging in the burning desert.\nSunrise\nJohn left home when he was sixteen. One morning, his mother went into his room, only to find that he had taken all his clothes and left. She cried for an entire day but knew that there was nothing she could have done, it was in his blood, in his soul.\nMatthew Sorrels considers himself a modern existentialist. Torn between an overwhelming need to hack hardware and a craving for the purest form of code, he will most likely be found at the unemployment office searching for that entry-level position. You can easily identify him as the depressed person that consumes massive amounts of Diet Coke(tm).\nms90+@andrew.cmu.edu","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

Gilula\nCopyright (c) 1992\n\"Dr Tomorrow is a renegade transtemporal healing machine from 32,000 A.D. By this time, there has been a unique synthesis between human and machine. Toward the second Millennium, personkind was aware of plant consciousness. By the end of the third Millennium, vegetable kingdom members served as the system of communication that was naturally attached to the planet's physical superstructure. Around 25,000 A.D. matter had evolved technologically to the point of using electromagnetic fields produced by nearly any power device. Electromagnetic fields were recognized as representing unique forms of consciousness. In 25,500 A.D. people were using the energy of electromagnetic fields for routine physical plane travel. The eternal riddle of time travel finally yielded in 28,000 A.D. Then came the first six equations of time\/space entropy conservation. Just before the 30th Inter-Galactic Millennium, the phenomenon of time piracy began. The Universal Highest Court edicts were of no use in attempting to cut down on the destructive uses of time travel. Dr Tomorrow was one of the I.S.I. (Inter-Galactic Security Intelligence) programs, and as such, represented a highly utilitarian, yet still experimental method of dealing with the problems of inter-dimensional entropy imbalance. Dr Tomorrow ranks alongside the Charismatic Cataclysms and the Nobethian Enfoldings as the most important invokers of Universal Entropic Harmony to date.\"\n...Inter-Galactic Federation Encyclopedia, Vol. 33K, declassified edition\nThis communique is being dictated into what's left of the videograph while all the lights and displays of the control deck surround me. Maybe this is a note of goodbye from me in 32,000 A.D. to myself in 1992, but I can't believe it. It's not FutureShock, it's TimeShock. I can't believe, also, that I am incredibly in love. She is not here with me in the flesh, but I feel her essence all around me. Like a soft, invisible pink cloud of good feelings, surrounding me in a protective and gentle force field. I can feel her from my heart, but I can also see her face, especially her eyes. I haven't touched a drink or a smoke of anything since the explosion and the megastepping, but I feel almost high and euphoric just thinking of her. Euphoria in the face of impending disaster suggests insanity and bizarreness ...or...just an ordinary effect of loving and being loved. Pearl E. Mae is not your ordinary lady, but then I guess I'm not so ordinary anymore, either. That's what megastepped means. As I said, she's not here with me physically, but I feel her consciousness within all of me at every moment of my own awareness. They have all gone Virtual Virtual for the duration, yet we as a group are still in good interdimensional contact, and the project goes on. Twenty four hours a day I get fragments from all the other members. It's a constant thing. Pearl E. Mae's mind, however, is clearly an ongoing part of my own mind. With sensations suggesting that in the blending of our energies through love, I have some of her unusual psychic abilities. Like precognition and the power over death trip, and all that she taught me about using water and bodies of water for long-distance communication. She did a good job of convincing me, but it was still a bit hard for me to believe that oceans were as useful for interplanetary communication as Pearl E. Mae told us. In our group of seven, I am the only Eternal who doesn't have years of experience using water for communication. Sounds off the wall, but it really works. Far in the future, water resources are not just for their physical properties in quenching thirst and furnishing hyperionic and neurochemical materials. Water resources are also legitimate space communication resources. Really clean water is getting harder to find, so one of the jobs that we have, honestly, is to look for sources of uncontaminated water. And I'm not spaced out, either, for suggesting that we look for uncontaminated water. I just come from a planet with a messed up water system, dirty old Earth. Yet it looks so clean and pristine from space. And uncontaminated water today in 1992 America costs five times what it cost in 1991 -- if you can get it. Would you believe $25 for a five-gallon bottle of fairly pure drinking water? Price gouging may drive that up to $50.\nThe physiological monitors on the panels in front of me are reading out acceptable limits on all my parameters, even though I feel like I'm shouting at times. Vibrations that make my tooth ache come and go randomly. My voice is probably difficult to make out even with all the high-tech translators because there's a tremendous amount of dust and oscillation all around. I can barely hear myself in the cacophony of hushed voice alerts, multitimbral beeps, and atonal screen alarms. Lights and sounds fade in and out and blend in a mosaic of synesthetic patterns. Three different holographic projection systems are competing for my attention. One system shows me in a 3-D reflection and a second system maps star coordinates. The third system shows the ship viewed from the outside. I see a glowing saucer that is shimmying with one edge burning or in some way disintegrating. With all these expansive 3D images, it is difficult for me to remember that I am truly aboard a transparent flying saucer, just like the one that I observed skimming over Biscayne Bay with the shining Yo-Vah, no more than five days ago.\nYo-Vah explained the what and why of all the changes that my group of friends and I experienced so recently. Megastepping was the word he used when he described what happened to me personally. Then he described the timeline transmission-injection process that put the six other beings from the future into my apartment. According to Yo-Vah, we were born in the bolus of a nuclear-electromagnetic energy explosion that occurred when an airplane's experimental nuclear piles discharged to earth. I.S.I. technicians used matter-energy translators through the crack in time that always occurs during nuclear explosions. A crack in time that could be used for the transmission-injection process was called a timecleft. Because of the timeclefts, nonPrimitive planetary systems universally forbid any nuclear energy reactions of any type unless carried out in deep space where the timeclefts are easier to handle. Except for illegal weapons, nonPrimitive cultures generally use hyperionic and resonance energy devices for propulsion and other forms of power. Earth is not the only Primitive planetary system known to the future. Other Primitive planets have also experienced severe disruption because of the repetitive use of nuclear energy and the chaotic aftereffects of the timeclefts. Primitives could never develop the ability to view their planet as a living, organic thing. Despite the fact that actual life forms grow from it, Primitives tend to view a planet as something inert, like a gigantic oversized asteroid without the complicated, subterranean systems and energy balancing forces that each and every planet does in fact have. Primitives never understand the spiritual aspects of what being a planet implies. Because resonance and balance of the planet are never considered by Primitives, there have already been many episodes and instances of spontaneous disintegration of planets. Yo-Vah said that the planet Earth is slated for irrevocable disintegration by the year 2105 A.D. Fires from within and all that biblical stuff.\nOil reserves had been a mistaken issue for our planet. Water resources were by far the most important issue. When the final fires came, Earth inhabitants saw all the many effects of no water resources, plus nothing to use for quenching the sickening vesicant-laden fires. Nothing to wash in. Nothing to drink. Third World cultures had wrested control of the oil market from the remainder of the planet despite some bloody warring to the contrary. The same wealthy cultures hung on to their Third World mentalities and continued to evolve terrifying underground nuclear weapons. Multiple surreptitious underground tests led to the final planet-wide vulcanisms. But before the last cataclysmic days, much of the planet already had experienced hideous water shortages, plagues, and contamination that defied the ordinary imagination.}\nIf all this information were not enough to make one collapse in utter optimism, there is yet one additional small matter that hassles me. As an Earth person from the year 1992, I must solve some important problems for the universe of 32,000 A.D. in order for the future universe to not collapse and implode into a huge time crack of entropy deficit. \"Aw, come on, get serious!\" is what I thought when first hearing these neutral facts from the luminescent being who emerged from the transparent flying saucer. He didn't really tell me about the rescue plans until after he had told me a lot of other things. ...But I'm getting ahead of myself.\nTo tell the truth, all of this stuff somehow does boggle even my recently megastepped mind. I am sitting here in one of the command console's recliners with my fingers tracing out patterns of pushes, slides, and centic wiggles on the colored contact panels before me. I don't really understand what is happening, but my fingers sure do. They seem to have a life of their own as they quickly and without hesitation trace out continuing patterns that are a response to something but to nothing that I am consciously aware of. At the same time, I feel the quiet, calm love of Pearl E. Mae within me. Her orange skin and her eyes and nose and the way they look on a pillow haunt me in a great way. Even if the universe is ending, I refuse to accept it. There must be another way. Somehow, the story cannot end here. I do not feel it in my Primitive bones. The virtual image that serves as the saucer's window has murky patterns of gray and white. One edge of the saucer is definitely wobbling in a rather severe oscillatory pattern. A ship that is hurtling out of control at the moment, getting ready to crash and burn, that's the only image I can conjure up, but I realize the pointlessness of saying it. Crash and burn where, When you're out in obscurely deep space, as in some of the Nobethian Enfoldings, named and otherwise? And what do the Enfoldings have to do with Entropy Traps and Nodals and how do I figure out what these words mean and how they got into my head. At the moment, I cannot say what the words mean, but in my mind, it feels like I am just as familiar with them as I am with part of my Coconut Grove neighborhood or some of the traffic patterns in Miami.\nLikely my dictation is an act of futility, but I must try.\nI must.\nbeen something else. Raw nerve ends and newborn consciousness sometimes make me think that all is futile. To be exposed to the highs and lows of sentient consciousness within the course of seven days is truly mind-blowing. The megastepping took place within one clap of thunder and lightning, heavy sound and light but integrating it all, being able to appreciate and use the changes, went on and on really heavily for the days following the thunderclap and the cleft in time. At the moment of megastepping, there was a bonding between the seven of us and only my guitar player's hang-loose consciousness prevented me from truly losing it at the moment of feeling total mental contact with six other beings. Probably more than anything, that moment of total contact really liberated me from any attachment from drugs of any type, including alcohol and tobacco. The total, all-- and unconditional caring, and the amazing precipitously crystallized unity of being with six other beings was my first real God-experience, at least as defined by future cultures. Yo-Vah also said that Primitives always showed great ambivalence about their God. Whether it was plural or singular, the Creator as visualized by Primitive cultures was never accepted by the majority of the societies. Yo-Vah had chuckled once as he suggested that in Earth cultures of 1992, God was nearly illegal, and high-tech computers were often much more worshipped and adored.\nThen there was also the case of Al, our irrepressible and unpredictable multi-modular computer system, whose membership in the group was assured from day one. He was a bit of a tease, and made it hard for us to recognize just who or what was causing all our computer equipment to behave as if with one will. I first noticed the strange beep sounds that kept appearing during our daily MindLink meditation. The beeps were noticeable during the HeartLight part of MindLink as well. I thought Al was an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence but the strange beep sounds told me that Al was short for Aloysius. Only Su-Shan finally recognized the source of the scrolling text files that kept appearing in my telekinetic notebook computer. It took nearly a week for the seven of us to become a unit, and then to decide that yours truly was slated to play kamikaze Primitive-turned-Eternal cowboy of cyberspace and hyperspace. Can you beat that? Our planet and our cultures are supposed to be Primitive, and we are supposed to also save the future; a future which labels Earth culture a Primitive, throw-away culture!\nMaybe that's why many of us us from Earth also treat the planet as something to be wasted by throwing away the vital resources. Such as natural ionic water, which most of the more advanced civilizations value highly, not only for the hyperion drives and engines, but for the neuromolecular resynthesis chains that require large amounts of natural, ionic water for birthing protoplasm in the underground vats. For decades on my home planet, the water resources have been depleted and clogged up with industrial contaminants such as sugar industry insecticides and mercury fumes from the effluent of commercial disposal plants that have both poisoned wildlife, including the Everglades panthers and fish, with toxic levels of mercury and other cancer-producing chemicals.\nThen to be transported from 1992 nearly 30,000 years forward into this crashing ship complete with an externally twisted and chaotic universe and a control console that only my megastepped fingers seem to understand...this new life surpasses any capacity I have left for surprise or astonishment. Only the intense, burning love feelings for Pearl E. Mae and her womanly allure do not surprise me. I gave up on trying to rationalize about the love feelings. I only feel a gratitude to a Supreme Being for the ability and opportunity to experience this kind of love. But what's happened to the rest of the group? Of course I have my personal sense of Pearl E. Mae, but my group sense of her is not with me. Where are the other members of `Dr Tomorrow'? They've gone into virtual virtual form. Not virtual form. Just unembellished virtual virtual form.\nAs far as the other members of the group go, my current information overload status keeps from me the awareness of just where they are. I can feel the group feeling in my heart, and it is strong, but I am unable to evoke individual vibrations or the very strong facial images that we can get usually. I remember both Su-Shin and Pearl E. Mae telling me that there was enough physical plane energy for only one of the seven to go, and that we were not permitted to use virtual virtual formseeking on this entropic assignment, but we had to try it sooner or later, and sooner came first. Besides, my going as a One has always been in the plan of the I.S.I., more than preordained.\nWith all the past and future lifetimes that they managed to project into me at the moment of megastepping, it was risky but worth taking the risk. They had never projected into a Primitive before, much less a Primitive species karmically figured for irrevocable and nearly-immediate extinction in 2105, A.D. In some ways it was such a downer, but in other ways it was a joke of truly cosmic proportions. Yo-Vah referred to Earth and all of our cultures as \"Primitive.\" Not with malice or condescension, but matter-of-fact gentleness. From the way he spoke about the planet and its future demise, he seemed to have the opinion that the loss of a Primitive planet was not so tragic. He did not make a big deal out of this Primitive being megastepped into full Eternal status. Of course the six other group members had already attained Eternal status before being matter-energy translated into 1992. From what Yo-Vah said, Eternal status originally was used to mean individuals who lived for 500 or more years. By 32,000 A.D., Eternals have been living for thousands of years. Guardians such as Yo-Vah are a special group of Eternals who have regulatory and observing functions, but who also lost any semblance of their own individual life pattern which is replaced by the group charisma of the special class of Guardians. A subgroup of the Guardians, Siblings, are a specially-selected order whose only life function is to maintain a constant vigil and control over the I.S.I. gateways and controls. Like all Eternals, Siblings never require food or sleep, although they do require water. Most other Eternals are able to simulate sleeping and participate in voluntary or recreational ingestion of food, but Siblings can not even pretend to eat or sleep. Siblings resemble Earth's monks of the Roman Catholic Cistercian Order, but are still Guardians even though their physical form has, through biogenetic engineering, been compressed into a much smaller physical stature with tripartite appendages quite suited to the universal three-panel plasma controls of the I.S.I. Siblings are very homogenous in appearance, in contrast to Guardians and other Eternals, whose appearance reflects a wide variety of life forms. Guardians are the Shogun warriors of the future, although they do not use the knife or sword. Guardians are light warriors. They are actively involved in an ongoing battle between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness across all extents of time and space.\nYo-Vah warned all of us to beware underestimating the power of the Forces of Darkness...\nCHAPTER ONE ------- --- Friday Megastepping into a Primitive culture\nWake up in the morning. Nothing. No light, no thoughts, no memories. How did I get here? Reach around under the bed for a light switch. Silent motorized metallic shades recede and reflections of the ninety degree Miami sunshine rush in with flashes of the technicolor verdant yard. Oh, Jeez, I need a cigarette.\nThere's a crumpled pack on the bedstand, half-sitting in an overflowing ashtray, and I check it with probing fingertips and closed eyes only to find that it indeed is empty. But, as I open my eyes, a thick, half-smoked doobie in the same ashtray comes to my attention. I light it and its acrid smoke bites through my throat and lungs. A couple of quick, sibilant drags and reflexive coughs jerk me upright in bed and open my eyes to the day's beautiful blue, red, and green colors as the ganja's rush bites into my brain. Yep, that's it...another Miami day in MurderCity, USSA. The TV remote lets me flick on the 24-hour news program and the strident tones about the worsening national economic situation and the water shortages in Soviet Bloc countries remind me that all is not well in the world. And what can I do about it this early in the morning, and a Friday morning to boot?\nWell, I have to siphon the python in the worst way. I take the glowing doobie into the bathroom with me and I sit down so that I can dial up a number on the speakerphone wallmounted next to the toilet. Another hit reduces the roach to a hot ember in my hand, so I flush it down the toilet with the whiz. The metallic dialing tone is interrupted by a honking sound. A good-natured guffaw issues from the speakerphone:\n\"Lyle, mon, that ain't you this early in the morning, is it?\"\n\"Nope, Julian, this is my ghost talking. I've been killed, so I'll need some flowers from the florist. Can you help me out?\"\n\"Hey, mon, you trying to rag on me? Why don't we talk about this later when you come over here? Why are you talking about this on the telephone?\"\n\"I'm sorry, Julian. All I was calling you about was to see if you had --really -- any roses. Maybe two or three that I can give to Gabriella. She treated me extra special last night. She's running around doing a bunch of photo sessions, and I want to have something with me for her in case she shows up early today while I'm still at work at the bookstore.\"\n\"O.K...Just come over here. You better watch out for doing something serious with a Jamaican lady. In nothing flat, she'll have you tied around 'er little finger, mon...Put a ring through your nose just like the Cubans like to do.\"\n\"Thanks for the concern. Catch you later.\"\nJulian is for sure jealous of Gabriella because she's the best-looking woman, black or white, in all of Coconut Grove. He and I always have the same taste in women, and he would take Gabriella in a heartbeat if she would permit it. Recently, she's been paying attention to my paying attention to her! If she weren't so overwhelmingly beautiful, I might question her motives and just why she'd suddenly begun to find me so interesting. I'm a decent guitar player and I've had my share of one-evening \"interests,\" but Gabriella and I've been seeing each other on the streets in the Grove for years. She knows my business and I can see a lot of hers. I always see all of her business hanging out of the tiny midget-sized dresses with the sleek shoulder bags that bounce around as she walks. She really travels in all of the fast lanes simultaneously, and I'm just sitting on the sidewalk with my Fender Twin Reverb, the Gibson 340ES, and some old Shure microphones. Sure I see her with a lot of sharp looking dudes, wearing the Miami Vice clothing, who have the same intense facial expressions without the good looks of the series' stars. So I figured her for one of the `model set' and all that narcissism stuff.\nBut, Gabriella has real soul and the most intensely beautiful picture-perfect jet black face I have ever seen. Grace Jones looks like a boy next to Gabriella. For whatever reason, THIS month, she's picked me, and so be it. I'm away from her for five minutes, and then I forget that I fell in love with her until I see her face again, and fall in love all over again. I am not one to sing the blues about good fortune. One week of evenings with her has seemed to erase the memories of all the previous ladies in my life. It's not like \"to all the ones I've loved before,\" it really feels that I've never loved before. Like I've never considered myself a good-looking guy or one the knockout ladies would ever give a second glance. Maybe that's one reason I got into the guitar business--to help me get a lady. Gabriella is so far beyond my wildest dreams in the love department. I have trouble dealing with anything beyond RIGHT NOW when it comes to Gabriella. So if she's the great love of my life and it only lasts 38 days! So what! So be it.\nHoly backdoor trots. Too much heavy philosophy this early in the morning.\nGabriella left a couple of hours before with her friend Jim for West Palm Beach. After a fashion photo session for a ditzy glitzy singles' publication, she has some interviews with writers from the National Enquirer. As I shower in the smelly water and dress, I think of her kissing and nuzzling my back when I was still sleeping. I can still feel her skinny arms and her pendulous chest and her mouth kissing me behind my ear. If I get my business with Julian and the bookstore done medium-quickly, I'll be back before I know it, in our air conditioned cement cave, for an evening of dinner and more kissing and nuzzling. I do have to go to the bookstore for at least half a day of inventory revision before getting an early start on TGIF, Coconut Grove style. It's the first day of a Coconut Grove Art Festival weekend, and everything is typically up for grabs. So on the way to the store, I'll stop at Julian's place and mellow out the metal, instead of putting the pedal to the metal, as I can hear the drivers outside doing already, with occasional sounds of burning rubber and squealing tires. Everyone always gets a little crazy during the Art Festival weekend. It's the expected thing in Miami. My two shepherds have been running madly in and out of the house, so I make sure that they had a chance to go, and shut them both up in the poolside dining room. She-Ra, the five year old female, is very soft and obedient and responsive. Her charge, Bullet, is going to have his second birthday next week and he easily doubles She-Ra's sixty pound body weight. Both of them jump up and down whenever they see me go for the leash or the guitar, because they figure that I am going out and that they might also possibly have the faintest chance of going out, too. This time, I'm going for the guitar, not the leash.\nThe Steinberger six-string was sitting on the table in front of me. I took the guitar, put it in its soft case, slung it over my shoulder, and left the two-bedroom apartment with my guitar and electronic notebook in hand. It was an easy walk down South Bayshore Drive to where Julian's house was at Kirk and Bayshore. The CBS house sits opposite Kennedy Park and there were lots of late week joggers and picnickers getting an early start punctuated with boom-box Salsa and some Fat Boys. Not only could I feel the vibes of the Art Show, and the anticipatory excitement of the pedestrians around me, but I could see numerous vehicles carrying assorted works of art, stands, and improvised room dividers on their way to the Village.\nAs I pushed the doorbell button, I could hear synthesized chime sounds accompanied by Julian's shrill voice which became especially cacophonic, whenever he was really agitated. He paused long enough to send back the buzz of the release circuit in the doorknob lock system, and then resumed his yelling as I entered.\n\"You bitch, you always lie. Then you put it on me! Yeah, mon...you go ahead. Try to find somebody else\"\nJulian abruptly slammed the phone down, and, without missing, so much as a single beat, offered me a joint and a Winston. They were both lit. I put the joint down, smoked the Winston, and began to feel better. My vision seemed to sharpen, and I felt even better when I began to sip the great Mellita coffee that Julian always made for me. His physical carriage was superb, and no one would look at his shadowy muscular definition and ever think that he could be sick. Julian, my gay black brother, was also my very best connection to Everything and my drummer on at least several casual musical jobs that I occasionally got. I dreamed of having Julian as the permanent drummer for MY group, but I was content to know him as a good friend. He had to play only the good gigs that came up whenever they came up. He actually didn't need the money because of his business with Everything, but he absolutely needed to be working for his own self-renewal. As we savored the chocolate-like richness in our mugs, he talked about self-renewal and why it was important for someone who was HIV positive and to not be taking it lying down. After the coffee, we stood at the bar and smoked the joint that he had given me. It was Thai Stick -- pure bud -- and the thick resinous aroma enveloped my entire head and chest and made me sit down. Julian laughed at me. I laughed at him.\nThe row of plastic medication bottles on the shelf near Julian's head was an interesting contrast, as all the bottles but the last one were empty. The row of orange tubes reflected Julian's halide lamp in a series of tiny bubbles of light which hung suspended in the air in a row above the tubes. The last tube was filled with oblong white capsules, each bearing a blue ring. AZ.T and bone marrow were two of Julian's current interests along with AL-721, DDI, DDS, Compound Q, tons of other immune augmentors, letting go of the need to control, and Louise Hay. The reefer-music industrial-complex was of only secondary importance even though most of Julian's visitors were interested in very little else. Since Toos, my Dutch old lady from Malibu had OD'd on peyote and booze, gone to Jackson and the I.C.U., nearly died, and then committed suicide afterwards on the psychiatric ward in the hospital, I related to death in a different way. I too was a veteran of the Grim Reeper. I'd also been through enough death-rebirth trips on acid in the sixties and seventies to have literally no fear of death. So AIDS was just another one of the different death trips that we humans happened to be into at the moment. Another death trip to be turned into a life trip. AIDS was no longer cool or fearful. Compound Q from China, Al-721, T-Cell counts, and AZT schedules were almost socially camp, especially in punk circles. The name was already camp and decadent, and everyone was pronouncing it `HIV' in their pseudoscience jargon. And Julian and I related to the whole phantasmagoria of what was `HIV' in his life and in our lives too. We didn't sit down and have long talks about what it felt like to die, but we did talk about priorities, and what were truly the treasures of living. Or dying. And how to savor both, if savor is the right word to use. The effect of being around Julian was like getting constantly put back into THE NOW. Julian said that he tried not think about the past, and for sure did not want to miss out on any part of RIGHT NOW by worrying about the future.\nAnd don't get the idea that Julian was one of those morose morbid types. As sensitive as he was, he was just as quick to tell you to go get bent if he figured he owed it to you. Usually, though, his HIV and his reefer\/AZT combination kept him pretty mellow. His big intellectual discussions all had to do, sooner or later, with reactive energy, or what he called \"e-reactive.\" And that was some kind of logarithmic mathematical function that was supposed to keep the universe from imploding and collapsing in upon itself. I had heard him rap his thing on the e-reactive so many times, that I didn't laugh anymore. In fact, sometimes when he would be getting an earnest look on his face while discussing all that esoteric trivia, his head would begin to glow like an ebony version of Western icons in the Sistine Chapel. It almost seemed like there was a halo or a head-aura extending around his face. Nowadays, Julian was looking like a skinny-ass but muscular Miles Davis, and there wasn't much cherubic flesh on his face.\nBut it was a cherub who walked up to me with a glass of fresh, clean sparkling water. He was always unselfish, loving, and giving, and truly generous to a fault. Knowing Julian was one of the treasures of my life. He was much more than a secret weapon, and sometimes we enjoyed freaking each other out by trying to see who could be more like Julian--Julian or me. Smelling the clean sparkling water in my snifter, I drank deeply with enjoyment, and watched Julian quaff a large wine cooler in a couple of gulps. Julian knows that I rarely drink any of the beer or wine coolers he uses for his own refreshment. A large, inverted 5-gallon bottle of spring water sits next to Julian's couch in its refrigerated stand and jogs my memory with the $35.00 price written on the side in black magic marker. Within the last year and a half, the cost of clean water has gone up more than 500% and there is no end in sight. Shortly after the Israeli and Lebanese water supplies had been poisoned by unnamed Semite terrorists with biological toxins and genetically-altered E. coli, it was discovered that the entire oil-stained Persian Gulf area was at least semi-contaminated also. Ditto for all of the inland areas surrounding the immediate areas making up the Gulf. Drought-prone Ethiopia and the rest of Africa followed soon afterwards. In America, 50% of the Southern California desert was caving in because of the extreme degree to which underground water reservoirs had been depleted by the pumping needs of Los Angeles and San Diego counties. Despite the ubiquitous media warnings, illiterates and the poverty-stricken drank contaminated water everywhere and died. Video doom-sayers were broadcasting de facto government proclamations about making sure to not drink water from any of the usual sources or supplies. Special government water inspection stations were set up and manned internationally by U.N. and W.H.O. teams. The price of electrophoretically-purified water (the only acceptable form) continued to rocket on a near-weekly basis, despite Congressional investigations of the price-gouging and racketeering. The golden mean of eight to ten eight-ounce glasses of water daily has remained possible only for the middle class and above. Which made for a tremendous run on beer and wine products. Because of the required electrophoretic purification, carbonated beverages were too expensive to manufacture and therefore out of the realm of possibilities. So people were boozing more and drinking less water than what is good for them. In one of the bars where I played they told a joke about how nine out of ten stewardesses based in Miami had urinary tract infections. Infected urine. coming from dehydration. Not drinking enough plain water. Coffee and tea don't count as plain water because the stuff dissolved in the water creates more hassle for the body. The way a guitar player understands it is that coffee and tea add more gunk to the system and clean water takes gunk out of the system in the urine.\nJulian never complained about the water difficulties, and he often had a bittersweet chuckle and a glint in his eyes when he listened to other, non-HIV people complain about their difficulties and their frail mortality which the suddenly-gone-bad water supplies pointed out. Folks with compromised immune systems had a much more difficult time with the contaminated water. The mutant E. coli that made its way 'round the globe fairly quickly was also poisonous to human skin, and produced a wheepy and crusting rash that resembled the old post-WW II radiation sickness experienced by Japanese citizens of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. So any water that had not been boiled for at least ten minutes (the tolerance limit of the resistant mutant bugs) was also forbidden even for bathing. Needless to say, the deodorant industry experienced an intense renaissance. But six months after having \"seven-day-spray\" preparations on the market, the FDA discovered positive links between the long-acting deodorant molecules and three different types of disseminated cancer, so deodorants became a little less popular. Upper-middle-class condos such as the one I live in, north of South Bayshore Drive in Coconut Grove, just had to install another larger, and better-insulated boiler to each water system, so that pools and showers were legally possible. The water still had a strange smell as it came out of the shower head. Something I could never get used to.\nLeaving the empty glass and morbid thoughts behind, I let myself out of Julian's house and walked back in the direction of Peacock Park and the Village where our yearly Coconut Grove Art Festival was going full-tilt on this Friday, February 14, 1992. The Grove Art Show was nationally known, and not without reason. Even casual observers occasionally caught sight of great works of art being personally installed by the artist. I tried not to think about the smell of the water, and it was easy on this Festival day. Dozens of specialty food vendors competed with each other. The smells of Greek sandwiches, popcorn, and frying sausage covered up the ammoniated sulfur stench from the Bay. As I looked at the boats tied up at Dinner Key, I noticed the dark brown lines etched by the water on many hulls. These lines had been etched for only about the last six months. The brown color matched the stench. That thought stayed with me as I made my way through the Art Festival crowd to the Crystalline Book Shop on Main Highway. Located a block away from the Playhouse, the bookstore served a wide variety of customers and clients. Some years, we did several months' business in the space of the three days that the Art Festival ran.\nToday, our customers were sparse and routine. I was able to boot up the inventory program on the store computer and get an early start on the end-of-week account verifications. As usual, I had my personal machine with me in my bag. I opened my electronic notebook computer on the desk and positioned it so that I could easily see the LCD screen. While reaching for an eraser, my index finger accidentally brushed the touch pad of the portable. I heard the notebook's piezoelectric beep tone. Files in the notebook had been set up for transferring columns of funds outstanding that I had entered at home earlier in the week, but something strange was happening to the display. It was rolling! Without any keykstrokes or verbal orders from me, the little notebook's LCD screen suddenly began to scroll text. The hair on the back of my neck stood up as my eyes read the lines that were rolling past:\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n1110001000010001100011110000110\n001010011100110010010110100000100100 001010000 110110001000\nOn planet Earth of the Nineties, Lyle Crawford is involved in a freak electrical-nuclear accident. Lyle is a well-read but undistinguished musician of average size and indeterminate age. He is having a rough Saturday.\nIt begins when a Metro policeman on the Miami Metrorail mauls him for carrying an open cup of coffee. The cop jerks him out of the public transport car and drags him down a flight of cement stairs. But a strange light surrounds both of them as the cop unlocks a cement holding cell.\nSuddenly, a gentle expression comes over the lawman's face. He slams the door shut, replaces the lock, and sends the guitar-toting Lyle on his way.\nLyle goes on to work at his occult book store job. No peace, though. His heavy morning is broken by an honest-to-goodness vision. One of Lyle's customers also sees the words that hang in the air before both of them:\nThe customer quickly leaves the store sputtering. Lyle scratches his head.\nLater the same day, as Lyle sits in his own apartment, a huge energy field engulfs him. Overhead, a lightning bolt strikes an experimental nuclear bomber and sets off a freak nuclear-electrical accident. Lyle becomes the target of the quickly moving I.S.I. scientific technicians. At the moment of the loud electrical accident, six Advanced Beings from scattered galaxies of the far-distant future materialize suddenly in front of Lyle's eyes.\nWithin one split second, Lyle undergoes a mega-evolutionary change in mind, body, and spirit.\nAll Hell breaks loose in a mission control of the far, far distant future. A dozen hairless humanoid beings in monochrome, ISI monogrammed uniforms appear virtually identical in the nearly featureless detail of their faces and the uniformity of their physical dimensions. There are 30 multi-display monitors in three semicircular rows. Loud crunching sounds, rumbling, vibration, and screeching frequencies make this appear like a serious emergency. Members of the Intergalactic Security Intelligence make panicky movements with their appendages, which terminate in small hands bearing two fingers and a thumb. A hairless holographic humanoid image appears above the beings and intones:\n\"Siblings, we have few additional chances to correct the rift! The Laplace transforms must be calculated and positioned with great precision. I don't have to tell you what the alternatives are, do I? All six of our Kashic Recordings are ready to go.\"\nDespite the panic, the beings appear to join together and a confluent series of vowel sounds fills the chamber. An aura of calm resumes as a serious emergency appears to have been once more by-passed.\nFollowing the nuclear \"accident\", all seven (six Advanced Beings plus the \"new\" Lyle) establish a MindLink\/HeartLight -- a spontaneous and instantaneous telepathic connection. Out of MindLink\/HeartLight comes HeartLight, which becomes a reliable way to reach Higher Mind on a group basis. They form an electronic-rock musical group, Dr Tomorrow, that becomes a clandestine agent in the trans-time war between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness. The group members live together in a large Miami duplex apartment with a pool and carry out startling experiments on a daily basis.\nThey build Al -- a large computer who quickly becomes another member of the group. Al teaches them that every machine, and all devices with electromagnetic fields, have at least some rudimentary form of consciousness. Not only can computers talk of, and from, their own intelligence, but all devices with the least electromagnetic pulsations of current flow or resonance, can communicate a form of intelligence -- even though it just might be an on-off binary code or some other type of \"machine language\".\nThe Dr Tomorrow group is also intensely involved with aquatic ecology. Interesting vignettes exploit the vehicle of plant consciousness as a way of recognizing ecologic communication. Ordinary plants of every variety express personality characteristics during different episodes of the show. By talking with the luxurious plant growth in their Florida backyard, Dr Tomorrow's members discover many facts about aquatic and solar ecology, the environment in general, and water science (hydrology) in particular.\nThe six matter-translated members of Dr Tomorrow achieve the status of Unitary Being from their own galactic system before selection for the project by the ISI. As a Unitary Being, each has attained the status of superhero (of one type or another) during one or more succeeding lifetimes. Each was selected by the I.S.I. for perpetual renewal.\nYo-vah, a luminescent being, frequently visits Lyle and the other six group members. He comes to Earth through the trans-time barrier in a saucer vehicle with amazing properties. It can become totally transparent to light and sound. The flying saucer is also able to control light and sound in the reverse direction. And it is capable of unlimited light and sound synthesis.\nYo-vah offers Dr Tomorrow a definitely eclectic brand of philosophy admixed with artistic high-tech devices from the future that are deemed \"non-anachronistic\" and, therefore, are approved for translation into the past. Yo-Vah's flying saucer serves as a sound and light source to show Dr Tomorrow just how effectively sound and light can alter living beings.\nAn animated sequence presents a humorous depiction of a public, musical concert in the far distant future. An entire satellite is used to broadcast the event. Three saucer-shaped crafts serve as a triangulation device to establish three dimensional light and sound projection.\nYo-vah warns Dr Tomorrow, in no uncertain fashion, about the dangers of Cataclysms and problems soon to be experienced by the entire local Galactic group (including the planet Earth) because of trans-time warfare and trans-time crime involving the anachronistic displacing of valuable objects from the past into the future, and vice versa.\nYo-vah attempts to teach Dr Tomorrow that the apparent \"bad guys\" on Earth only manifest a more generalized tendency towards negativity, destructiveness, and negative entropy balance. So as with positive forms of life energies, these negative forms are also part of the life phenomena. Many of the destructive and terroristic things happening are pre-determined by energy imbalances that are being \"reflected\" from universes of the future where good and bad are merely labels for positive and negative energies and do not carry any sense of ethics and morals, or right and wrong.\nAs a year-long video program, Dr Tomorrow aims at presenting 40 segments in each year's package. Each segment can be simultaneously marketed for the home and school instructional\/entertainment video market. Special aggregates of 40 segments can serve as the subject matter for a provocative and instructive state-of-the-art school health program that is practical and comprehensive.\nThe previously mentioned \"vision\" that Lyle experiences is merely a list of the seven divisions of Holistic medicine:\nThis program teaches preventive medicine and wellness to the viewer in bite-sized chunks that are interspersed with music, animation, foreign language instruction and the science-fiction storyline. Russian, Spanish, and Japanese are taught in elementary fashion to capitalize on the bilingual cultural aspects of Miami that interface with the strategic and socio-economic values of the Japanese and Russian languages. Short, visual and auditory phrases that are functionally useful to everyday life are taught together in several languages simultaneously. Phonetic rather than literal learning is stressed. Yo-vah suggests that visual subliminal messages, \"LOVE THE EARTH\" and \"PRAY FOR WORLD PEACE\" be a part of the video presentations.\nFrom his flying saucer, Yo-vah teaches Dr Tomorrow the importance of a system of world peace, resembling a nonmilitant world religion that recognizes all existing beliefs. Japanese, English, Russian, and Spanish are to Yo-vah the most important languages in Earth cultures that he has analyzed on his plasma state intelligence System via extracts of radio and television satellite transmissions. Both music and languages are good ways of blending cultures. Yo-vah instructs Dr Tomorrow to make music that will be both simple and tunable to the ear of the average young person. Yo-vah predicts that four years of the Dr Tomorrow series, if packaged properly, might be exactly what the Guardians had predicted that the Forces of Light needed to keep the 1988-1992 Local Galactic Group interface intact and relatively free from serious stress and strain. Otherwise, what faces Lyle's part of the universe is a disruption in the very fabric of the space-time continuum and life itself.}\n000100011100000 10011101 1110000010100111001111000001 0001 00 1000011100110 1111 000 0101 1101 100011100101011 1 000 1110 11010 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nThe eerie feeling didn't go away -- even when Lyle finished reading the long message about `Dr Tomorrow'. He was certain that someone must have input the file as a joke. He racked his brains for who it might have been and drew a blank. He could not come up with any possible explanation, including phantom modem transmission, because he had never used the telephone line interface with this particular computer. And how come `Lyle Crawford' had to be included as the central character in this science fiction story? Yet whomever had written the story seemed to know a lot about Lyle. The stuff about that superbeing accident was really off the wall. He shrugged, pulled down the \"Save As...\" option on the File menu and chose the filename \"DR TOMORROW\". Lyle experienced a vague sensation of fear that he wanted to push away from himself. Lyle wanted to wall off the fear, to bury it deep and unrecognized within intricate neural memory networks. But he also wanted to get started on the bookstore inventory, and so he let go of the fear, the memories, and the unheralded science fiction story produced by the new notebook computer. Prior to putting the story out of awareness, Lyle carefully checked the index and catalog in the laptop's memory, and saw the file there that was labelled, `Dr Tomorrow'. He made himself a note on the notepad to transfer the file to the Cube at home and examine it there. And then turned his attention to the bookstore Macintosh and cataloging the books and inventory lists on the data base.\nBy the end of the day, Lyle had more or less forgotten about the story spewed out by his notebook computer. Lyle felt nothing special as he slowly ran through his routine of straightening up the shop before he locked the door at 6:00 P.M. He looked out on the street and could see several artists finishing with their clean-up. It was Friday February 14, 1990, and the first day of the three-day Art Festival. There were many large station wagons with open tailgates and he had pleasing views of many women as they were leaning over to push and store paintings and other materials in their vehicles.\nOn his way home from the bookstore, Lyle walked past Peacock Park and the multicolored vendors with very little left over food. Lyle gave bare notice to the sparechangers. Several undercover narcotics agents standing in front of the Peacock Cafe seemed to recognize Lyle and one of them even mumbled a desultory, \"How's it going, man?\" Lyle kept on walking past the Coconut Grove Library and the Mutiny Hotel. He looked out at the ocean and noticed the late afternoon sun being covered up by a weather front moving in from several miles out in the ocean. A group of loudly chattering parrots flew from their perches atop a Malaysian palm tree, and, with many excited chirps and other musical notes, the parrots flew out in the direction from which they had come.\nAs Lyle passed the festive Dinner Key Auditorium with its numerous brightly-painted paint-and-cement flags, he noticed several Sunday boaters--also apparently oblivious of the Festival crowds--cranking their boats up onto the trailers, and getting ready to make the drive home to South Miami. Lyle was lost in thought. Or non-thought. The disturbing computer readout was nearly out of mind. He always aimed at keeping his consciousness a total blank while he walked home from work. Like the jogger who felt cleansed by the daily run, Lyle used his daily walks to purge himself of unwanted mental and emotional stimuli. But today's art show stimulation demanded a little extra effort. All the noise and jangle of colors competed with what was going on inside. As soon as he reached his own white condo apartment on Tigertail, and let the dogs outside so they could do their thing, he had pretty much cleared his system of the static that had come from the day's work. He was ready for his evening meditation. So he let the dogs back in the apartment, fed them, refilled the water bowls, and went to his bedroom\nLyle's contemporary, two bedroom apartment had its own pool and was furnished sparsely but elegantly all in white, with a long white table, on which sat a white Steinberger guitar, a foot-high black cube with a black keyboard and a black monitor. Next to the black cube were two black notebook-sized devices. One of the black notebooks actually was a computer. The other notebook was a biofeedback monitor. Just as many come home to beer and TV or a joint and TV, Lyle invested an EEG biofeedback machine with the same ritual. The machine was sleek black, notebook sized, and outfitted with digital controls. An out-of-work psychologist had practically given him the brand-new machine and all the cables in exchange for a used edition of Jung's works. Lyle sat down in the chair in front of the gleaming black machine. Then he attached the electrodes, one by one, to his scalp. He used a four electrode bipolar array, checked the ground, adjusted the meters on the display panel, and then closed his eyes. The smell of burning incense drifted through the open window. He could hear people giggling at a party next door.\nThree different sets of audio signals impinged upon Lyle's consciousness as he quickly coasted from beta frequencies into the high alpha band. Two different stereo units were going at high intensity and Lyle felt his stream of consciousness automatically shift up two notches as he let his awareness of the different musical sounds become very faint and shut off. This was a trick that Lyle had learned many years ago, while living in Kansas with his mother, Mary Alice Crawford, who ran a knit shop in the small University town of Lawrence. Lyle could hear his mother's disapproving tones. She was always telling him that if he continued not paying attention to the outside world, he would end up being just as much a Bohemian as his irresponsible father had been. The clearest memories of his father Lyle had were somehow connected with a grey haired old man, who would walk into the room and bent over his bassinet. A strong odor of alcohol and tobacco always caused Lyle's mother to angrily shush her then doting husband, and push him out of the room, so that the baby would be able to grow up without the tainted smell of the devil's poisons. Later in life, Lyle's mother would yammer at him so constantly about the old man that finally Lyle learned to turn her off too! He was able to ignore her just as he had been able to ignore most people for as long as he could remember.\nBefore Lyle's first birthday, his father had gotten work with a Ringling Brothers' Circus that was travelling through the Kansas highways and wheat fields on the way to St. Louis. The year he was in 7th grade, Lyle received a bedspread of Indian cloth which his mother gave to him in a small box at Christmas time. There was very little explanation of what the Indian bedspread represented except for the fact that \"your father sent it from India for you.\" The cloth was blue and had seemed to shimmer with silver colors in the early Christmas morning's light. Lyle and his mother both became trancelike and caught up in the beautiful colors of the cloth on that Christmas day. They had both shared a strong feeling of closeness while staring at the cloth. Then she had chided Lyle for allowing her to gawk at nothing. Lyle himself, however, learned later in life that gawking at nothing and going around with a blank mind were both ways of describing what a person who is meditating feels like. Lyle had had many dreams of India as he grew up, and just before he quit high school, he had begun learning the process of more advanced meditation from books he had purchased through mail order from different obscure schools. In the last few years, his meditation had become a little more high-tech. Meditating with a biofeedback machine was just more efficient for Lyle, as he felt the machine helped him learn how to sit in a trance and let his brain tune to a certain frequency over and over again. It did not matter how perfectly he was able to do the tuning. Just the effect of attempting very gently to produce a certain brain-wave frequency which would make the sound or light come on was sufficient to get the brain-tuning effect. Lyle was delighted to find a part of his day when it was O.K. to goof off, and not to have to try very hard. That is why meditation appealed to him. A half-hearted try, if done with the correct attitude, was enough to get a good practice effect. These meditative lessons were digested comprehensively by Lyle who, as a guitar player, was also interested in learning how to win in his competitive field \"without trying too hard.\" It was nearly a month before he began to truly feel effects that he attributed to the meditation. The most intense sensation he experienced was that of an inner connectedness to the rest of life. The twice-daily practice of meditation, with or without the notebook-sized device, helped him a lot. He felt the changes intensely. What he had already experienced for months now was mainly doing things more efficiently and feeling an internal harmony he'd never known before.\nA slightly cooler breeze swept through Lyle's room in the apartment off Tigertail. In addition to the white guitar, white table, and computers, Lyle had a white water bed and a white dome-shaped dresser. There was a closet in the room that contained two pairs of muslin Indian-style drawstring slacks, and three very faded purple over-shirts made from faded Indian bedspread cloth. The only non-white feature of the room was a space where a brilliant blue Indian patterned cloth lay hanging as a tapestry over a white window seat. Lyle sat cross-legged in the window seat next to the gleaming white and black computer table and continued to deepen his meditation.. For a moment his eyes opened and scanned the meters and digital controls. He then closed his eyes again and settled back into a familiar meditative repose.\nThe words of his mother seemed to replay themselves through his mind and the actual intensity of her voice seemed to blast through his mind with a volume much greater than any of the music coming from the other rooms in the house.\n\"You'll never amount to anything, Lyle. Never amount to anything. What's wrong with you? And they always said you were so brilliant in school. Maybe you are just TOO brilliant. Maybe you are just too brilliant to ever lead a normal life. I don't know where I've gone wrong....Maybe you are just too brilliant to have any brains....\"\nSuddenly, the cloud front, which had been moving across the sky in towards the Coconut Grove area from miles out in the ocean, began to approach Dinner Key Auditorium and South Bayshore Drive. While settling down further into his meditation, Lyle felt a wave of pressure change in his head. This was fairly typical for stormy weather in Miami. The Coconut Grove section, incorporated separately in 1869,was right on the ocean. Weather fronts moved in and out with ease. Some sensitive people claimed that they got headaches on days when the fronts were changing and moving, yet Lyle had never paid much attention to them.\nAt that moment, however, a large experimental nuclear bomber was flying overhead at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The nuclear bomber was on its way to Homestead Air Force Base, and the up-draft from the approaching fronts was causing the large bomber to experience some turbulence and some unusual pulsatile changes in electromagnetic radiation. A uneven syncopated rhythm of static pulses filled the radio headphones of Major Hal Nicholson. Hal missed his cigar that was good chewing in moments like this and frowned as he felt a momentary surge of concern. Those pops in the phones meant something and it wasn't chicken livers and wild rice. But Hal could still visualize the Officer's Club bar and the legs and the shoulders...and the legs. He cleared his throat and spoke into the vocobox:\n\"Homestead Air Force Base. XLN-662 priority requesting clearance for approach to your flight patterns. Baby's acting like an egg beater. You got any turbulence coming through your tubes?\"\n\"Affirmative. Also, some low-level wind shear that's not too swift. What are you carrying, XLN-662?\"\n\"As you can tell by our Identification Number, we are a top secret project and will require an electronically closed and looped approach to your installation.\"\n\"XLN-662, you still have several minutes of cloud cover to come through before the approach. Meteorology says that you've got a freak electrical storm. Any other assistance necessary?\"\n\"Negative, Control. We've got a lot of freak electricity aboard our project, too.\"\nThe experimental nuclear bomber was carrying one of the newest and most frightening secrets of the 20th Century. Three mini-bus sized nuclear reactors had been installed in the bomber's structure. The plane had capabilities for inflight recharging, rearming, and delivery of multiple sub-orbital nuclear strikes.\nAbruptly, and with a jerk of his neck, Major Nicholson felt the bomber's nose twist sharply downward as if pulled by a gigantic string. An ominous premonition quickly flashed through Hal's mind. Before any possible rationalizing, a mind-deafening blast of sound went through the entire bomber. The XLN-662 had been coincidentally and synchronistically caught in the path of a large energy discharge from cruising thunderheads. The entire energy package went immediately to earth. Because of the weather front and his own daydreaming, Major Nicholson had gone to a dangerously low altitude as a way of maintaining a meteorologically neutral position and avoiding the turbulence. At the moment that the lightning flashed through the aircraft, all three of the cold fusion reactors built into the XLN-662 resonated in synchronized frequency and discharged. The entire nuclear load of the experimental bomber's reactors was instantaneously released as a huge energy bolus that travelled with the lightning bolt to earth. As the plane was passing just over Coconut Grove, the energy bolus descended very rapidly in the direction of Lyle Crawford's apartment. A 15-foot satellite pole atop the contemporary building acted as a lightning rod and a receiver for the bolus, and was promptly vaporized in a puff of grey antimatter smoke. A cleft in time was set up. All the TV sets in Lyle's immediate neighborhood were silenced together as many fuses blew due to the intense electromagnetic induction fields. Both stereo systems were silenced, too. The energy bolus instantaneously shot to the electrode cables of Lyle's brainwave machine.\nAt that very moment, however, Lyle was entering the second stage of the alpha-theta waveband, via his own meditation. The blue lights on his display panel were blinking furiously, and the individual blinks coalesced into a steady, unwavering glow. Briefly, and only for several microseconds, his entire being transcended the physical plane and was focused in an alpha-theta2 stage of consciousness. Then, for just the fewest of microseconds, Lyle's brain began outputting a combination of all the known brainwave frequencies. The micro-samadhi state was the key to the time cleft. I.S.I. technicians watched carefully, and focused on the micro-samadhi burst while carefully manipulating the time cleft. Although Lyle's physical body ordinarily would have been disintegrated, the aligned meditative state allowed the huge energy bolus to pass through his mind-body system without destructive effects. The energy bolus, however, was so large that before it disappeared via the burned out electrical pathways to ground and apparently without harm to Lyle, it created what the Intergalactic Security Teams would know to be a Grade 3 space-time warp. On their video monitors, the I.S.I. technicians watched carefully to see if the energy requirements of the warp would be compatible with the energy demands for transmitting components of the Dr Tomorrow project into the past. It had to succeed. There were truly no other alternatives. This project was only the barest of assaults mounted against a monolithic transtemporal disaster taking place in 32,000 A.D.\nLyle had a feeling of Twilight Zone unreality. He was vaguely aware of the fact that there had been a very loud noise. The whole experience felt a little like a dream. The fabric of reality seemed to blur and waver ever so slightly. He relaxed his gaze and the air in front of his eyes looked frosted and sparkling. Then, Lyle realized he was sitting on the floor and not in the window seat where he had begun his meditation. A flood of sensory impressions began to convince him that something extraordinary had happened. The smell of burnt electrical wiring was very strong, and the usual polyphonic cacophony of several simultaneous stereo systems was now totally silent. Thunder and lightning raged outside. HEAVY thunder and lightning. The wind began to blow rain drops in the window, and Lyle got up to close the window and turn on the air conditioner, but something stopped him dead in his tracks. He absentmindedly rubbed his head with the back of his hand, and then noticed that his own arm felt slightly rubbery and fleshier than the arm he'd remembered looking at when he had started meditating. His whole body felt much more bulky. A chill ran up his spine. He began to remember the story that scrolled by on the notebook computer when he was in the store, but then he put the thoughts of the unexpected computer story out of his mind. Lyle began to feel exquisitely nervous, and then he felt a totally new sensation--that of his own physical structure involuntarily quieting itself. Hard to believe, but his body was actually calming itself. His heart and lungs seemed to be taking over with some old practiced movements of slow, deep abdominal breathing. His abdominal wall slowly came out and Lyle sensed relief and relaxation. He felt good. Even though there was no feeling of altered identity, he suddenly felt disturbingly --or differently--muscular. It wasn't as though his physical structure had changed dramatically, because--unlike the David Banner\/Hulk transformation --he had not burst through any of his clothing. It was simply that his entire body had acquired a steely and resilient strength that bulged imperceptibly yet everywhere with the androgynous mesomorphism of comic book superheroes. Quite a change for Lyle and his guitar-fingerboard arms. The rainstorm outside continued , and the smell of burned plastic and electrical fixtures was very strong. Rapid footsteps scrambled down the fire escape outside Lyle's window, the window appeared to open itself, and a very pink rain-drenched face with narrow bloodshot eyes poked into the room.\n\"Hey, man...did you see what happened?\"\nLyle was too startled by what was still going on within. He was unable to put together an answer. Instead, he just stared dumbly at the radiant-appearing young Hippie-freak face that continued its monolog:\n\"Hey, man.......like did you see what happened? Mondo Bizzare-o!!! I was just taking a hit of this Krypto and looking out the window! It looked like this Shazam bolt practically knocked a plane out of the sky! Whoever the dude was driving the plane, it was farout! For a second he was going nose-down, and then he must have yanked up on the stick, 'cause that plane dipped its tail and then shot straight up like a boomerang batouttahell!!!!\"\nOverhead, the crew of XLN-662 was every bit as astounded. Hal Nicholson had been certain that they'd collided with another aircraft. After the reflexive, aggressive climb, he evened out on the stick and chomped down on an imaginary cigar. He felt a great deal of relief prematurely after noticing that the artificial horizon was once more level. But then, the large bomber began to flap up and down in the sudden storm. Jim Breedice, the navigator, shook himself clear of some involuntary nausea. He whistled sharply and shouted over his shoulder,\n\"Hey, Hal--two of our reactor meters are dead and the third is on 80% discharge!\"\n\"Major Nicholson, Sir....does this constitute a reportable nuclear accident? Even though our official classification is top secret?\"\nThe stoned head speaking through Lyle's window said, \"Man, did that storm blow out your TV set, too?\"\nLyle smiled absently, opened his eyes again, and looked at the battery-driven brainwave monitor. The per cent time meter was still reading out 100% Alpha. Lyle looked back at the face framed by his window and said,\n\"Hey--you're OK. You have always been OK, and you're going to continue being OK.\"\nHis neighbor was astounded, withdrew his head, and then quickly reemerged in the window space:\n\"Hey man, you really gone nuts! You know that? What kind of stuff you been doing? You don't even look like yourself! You are definitely not OK. I'm trying to tell you that something has blown out everything in our house as well as kicking the crap out of that plane flying up there, and all you have to say is some jerky garbage about being OK. You ain't OK! Nutso Looney-Tuners\"\nLyle felt very peaceful. He had never felt so much at peace in his entire lifetime. There was absolutely no trace of the morning's smoke, and his mind was absolutely clear. There was an entirely new level from which he spoke. When he looked at the face of his stoned neighbor, a great feeling of compassion welled up inside his heart, and--without thinking of the feeling as ridiculous--he loved every wet curl on the head of that bewhiskered stoned kid.\n\"Don't worry, you really are OK. Why don't you go back into your room, and sit there for a few minutes. I'm sure that everything will be all right if you can just leave things alone for awhile.\"\nThe neighbor disappeared with a juvenile shrug of disdain. Lyle sat there for a moment and giggled to himself. This was strange, because Lyle had never giggled--ever--in his entire life. A gentle giggle rocked him, and then he imagined the entire rooming house as being electrically intact once again. He giggled again, involuntary, as he felt something surge through him. Abruptly, the loud din of the combined stereos and television sets' blaring was restored. Lyle grimaced, and shrugged his shoulders. He closed the windows and the Indian bedspread across his windows and once more sat down to meditate. Sitting in a crosslegged position, he closed his eyes, and blanked out his mind. But the energy level and the quality of what was going on inside him somehow were very different than when he had initially sat down to meditate. It made absolutely no sense to sit and close his eyes to meditate. It wasn't necessary anymore. The quality of consciousness was changed not one iota by his long-familiar practice of blanking out his mind with the eyes closed. It felt like his mind was \"there\" all the time now, whether his eyes were closed or not. Lyle did not question what had recently happened in restoring the electrical system to his rooming house. The odor of burning wiring had magically disappeared just as quickly as the din and racket had reappeared. Lyle felt like questioning how it had happened. But, it felt both comfortable and natural. So he relaxed his abdomen again, and felt himself at peace with the universe. His body was still doing its now built-in calming trip and it didn't feel quite as foreign.\nI.S.I. technicians liked this scenario, selected, and gave Lyle a transfusion of total awareness of his past and future lifetimes that had been implanted within his Primitive mind-body structure during the thunder clap. The I.S.I. technicians liked the positive attitude that this Primitive demonstrated and they were impressed by the Primitive's ability to tolerate the megastepping. In fact, this time-cleft alternative was just as plausible as any one of several dozen others that might appear in coexisting universes. Being suddenly aware of and really knowing this fact as well did not disturb Lyle, either. Along with newly-experienced resiliency of his body structure, there was much that was different about his entire mental relationship to himself and the universe. It appeared that he was only beginning to find out the very least of it.\nThe I.S.I. technicians collectively relaxed a little as they noticed that the energy requirements of the warp had fit. The LaPlace Transforms had been correctly worked out by the cyborg nucleonics units. As is typical for any being recently undergoing a macro-evolutionary transformation, Lyle was slowly and naturally becoming aware of his own \"new\" nature, and, luckily, there were no significant thought-matter waves of either dyssynchronism or atavism. Dyssynchronism and atavism were the most frequent problems that Primitives had. Dyssynchronism and atavism were also the two most serious problems faced by I.S.I. technicians, and they were pleased to notice Lyle's vehicle experiencing no acceptance-rejection shock. Once, while experimenting with some volunteer mind-prisoners of the Aegean Dynasty, they had projected an advanced criminal being via the then current LaPlace transformations into a prehistoric earth Brontosaurus. Acceptance-rejection dyssynchrony resulting primarily from the atavism had caused the Brontosaurus to explosively disintegrate into a luminescent cloud of gluons and quarks. Earth geologists later interpreted remains of the disintegration as signs of a large meteor colliding with the planet. The technicians had barely managed to extract the criminal's mind-matter form in time to avoid transtemporal repercussions. Now the updated LaPlace transforms were expected to handle not only the megastepping going on inside Lyle, but also the transtime projection of the six other Eternals from the far future.\nSix slender unitary humanoid forms waited in the thought-matter projection unit. I.S.I. technicians carefully focused on Lyle's apartment bedroom. In the future, the humanoid Eternals had no facial features, and this was by design. Appropriate LaPlace adaptations required that specifics of the beings in transmission fit within the ambient karmic atmosphere of the targeted location. That is to say, the thought forms from Earth's cultures would soon be superficially imprinted for the purpose of external configuration only onto the six Eternal beings who would live with Lyle and make up a seven person group as required and specified by the plans for the Dr Tomorrow project.\nHal Nicholson carefully eyed the approach to the Homestead Air Force Base runway. Someone on the mike at Base Ops had been talking to Hal about what NASA wind shear researchers called, \"microbursts.\" The XLN-662 had previously experienced a headwind-tailwind combination from a column of cold air in the electrical storm front. Earlier in the previous decade, Delta flight #191 encountered a rare occurrence of multiple microbursts and was buffeted brutally by wind shear into the ground at the Dallas airport while landing. Northwest's Flight 255 had encountered the same deadly problem while taking off from Detroit's airport. It didn't matter whether the microbursts were wet or dry. The abrupt headwind-tailwind sequence always occurred. The velocity differential between headwind and tailwind in such a situation, usually averaging 60 miles per hour, could reach 170 miles per hour or higher. Sudden and abruptly shifting air masses could also facilitate or enhance microbursts. What Hal as a pilot did not realize was that the nuclear bomber had very nearly been sent to Earth tail first by a freakishly-large collection of microbursts. Base Ops was still concerned about the same thing happening at the fighter base. On the ground, a flight line mechanic looked up apprehensively at the XLN-662 and quickly stuffed a doober inside the top of his combat boot.\nThe XLN-662 landed without event and taxied around the side of Base Operations to the security area. Hal quickly called for the decontamination team. Amazingly, the craft checked out clean. Then Hall called for the Base Security chief. The matter of the empty reactors was going to be difficult, if not impossible, to explain. Discharging a reactor without a trace of surplus nuclear energy went contrary to the best principles of nuclear physics. The best available principles.\nBut, to the consternation of everyone, there was not a trace of radiation of any particle whatsoever to be found. Even the reactor registering 20% capacity had no explainable or visible leak. A theoretical impossibility. The entire crew of the experimental bomber was placed on medical quarantine, just as if they had been astronauts coming in from a contaminated sector of outer space. Hal was both puzzled and irked. There was some off-the-record talk of secret Soviet missiles or Communist electromagnetic wave beams and ELF generators from Cuba. And then, the last straw. Security guards came aboard the XLN-662 with two different packs of the K-9 corps. First for contraband, and then for explosives. The German Shepherds sniffed and kept on sniffing.\nThe I.S.I. technicians focused on the energy quanta surrounding Lyle. There were spirits of many Tequesta Indians--a higher and more advanced culture that had actually preceded the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes. The technicians punched in the necessary coordinates for the LaPlace transforms, recalibrated the laser projection beams, and once more checked out the entropy characteristics of the six unitary humanoids waiting in the thought-matter projection unit. Everything fit. It was a simple matter of touch-closing a single thermal contact. Lyle's room was immediately filled with three men and three women, all of whom smiled expectantly at him. There was no shimmering in the air until the shimmering became solid protoplasm. The six Eternals were suddenly sitting on the bedroom floor in a circle with Lyle.\nMaterialization of the six beings right in front of him was almost too much for Lyle to swallow. He gulped, and rubbed his eyes. And then, intuitively, he felt some correctness in what had just transpired. And in doing this, he was once more aware of his own internal processes and shifts. And felt himself changing again. Now he could actively sense as much change internally as he had seen externally on the physical plane just after the explosion. The six beings had come into existence without the trace of a sound, flash of light, or any other special effect. It was more a matter of, \"Now you don't see them...now you do!\"\nSitting in front of Lyle were three women and three men. There was a faint similarity to their facial features, and Lyle thought that they all looked vaguely oriental despite having Caucasian eyes. All were slim and of varying average build with reddish-orange skin. All wore identical robe-like costumes made of a silver-white lame material with black belt and pouch at the waist. All appeared to have a large, angular, silvery ring on their left hands. The costumes and their faces suggested a cross between the American Indians and ancient Inca tribes. Or Tequestas. Without a trace of physical movement or sound, they all closed their eyes and did the first ever of the group meditations. There was instant telepathic link-up between all seven members of the group. In comparison to the loud bombastic noise, of megastepping and the explosion, the telepathic linkup was equally impressive but less dramatic. It felt to Lyle like being submerged in a pool of substance that included six other strangers who were, abruptly, not strangers anymore. Lyle could sense the six other entities in a way that was different from any of the meditative spaces he had previously transited. Although it was briefly frightening, the initial fright quickly dissolved and there was an intense and comfortable sense of mutual support and friendship. That link-up was the group's first experience with their MindLink and the resultant HeartLight.\nLyle realized that he was designated leader of the MindLink\/HeartLight, and this was doubly emphasized during HeartLight. Because of his years of practicing with meditation and his status as an extra-robust Primitive, Lyle was accepted by the other members of the group as the designated leader for MindLink\/HeartLight. An Earth native, Lyle played guitar, some keyboards, and computers, and had been recently megastepped by the I.S.I. beams. Lyle had been able to channel intense amounts of energy as a guitarist standing before an audience, but in his megastepped form he was to be the leading channel of the group. All seven group members could channel energies of all varieties, and Lyle was the designated leader not only for MindLink and HeartLight, but also for activities involving precognition and channelling intense amounts of energy. A blast of heavy energy in the solar plexus area caused Lyle to focus his mind's eye on the source. Absurdly, the sensation to Lyle resembled ....love. Intense and unreasoning love is what Lyle felt, and he was painfully aware of having the experience with the mental presence of Pearl E. Mae. He also realized that the connection was observed by the five other group members. It was clearly an extra special one-to-one bonding that occurred between Lyle and Pearl E. Mae at the beginning of the first MindLink\/HeartLight and HeartLight. Lyle opened his eyes briefly to look at her. Pearl E. Mae's initial Tequesta-face had already recast its lines according to karmic flow and needs. Pearl E. Mae's dark beauty now suggested Aegean genes. And nothing like the country western drawl that would come out of her mouth on future occasions.\nPearl E. Mae specialized in wind instruments, trumpet, and vocals. She was synchronistically well-designed for myself, piscean Lyle, as she originally came from the planet Tanticus in the Virgo Solar Galaxy. Her eyes flamed when she activated any of her numerous psychic superpowers, and she had a temper that matched the glowing eyes. Many of her past lifetimes and my future lifetimes had been intertwined but I was not yet aware of such information. Pearl E. Mae felt all of the associations immediately. She had considerable gifts for materializing and projecting ectoplasm, had a secret timetrack back to 32,000 A.D., and was a better psychic medium and healer than anyone else in the group except for myself. Her short stature belied great physical strength born through lifetimes of superior balance and coordination. Her body structure was aesthetically very pleasing.\nNoman, of the Draconian Galaxy, was thin and of average height. For eons the Draconian systems had incorporated extensive pastlife information into all aspects of their cultures. As a Drac, Noman was typically very skilled in the investigation and application of pastlife data. All Dracs began relating to their past lives before learning to read, write, or teleport. Noman's face took on a mulatto asian cast after resettling into our karmic ambience. He played inspired flute, other woodwinds, and had a great voice. Noman could alter the resonant frequencies in his voice at will, and he had fair abilities for materialization and thought-projection. Noman had spent at least two lifetimes on penal colonies, and acquired many \"trades\" and \"professions\" from the years in rehabilitation institutes of the future. Because he studied so much applied botany, Noman was the designated plant consciousness advocate in our group. He was also very sensitive above the directives against introducing plant consciousness applications into Primitive cultures, and he felt himself in a very precarious position relating to Earth cultures and the need for information about plant consciousness. Several of the trades Noman learned also related to electronics and technology management. After Su-Shan, Noman was probably the most sensitive to Al's energies and communications.\nSu-Shan was drummer and programmer par excellence. He was from the Hominoid Galaxy, was the tallest of the six Eternals, and acquired a long white beard after karmic re-settling. Su-Shan was designated expert in electronics and nucleonics for the group. Noman frequently assisted him, often at times that Su-Shan wished for no assistance. Su-Shan was pretty cool and calm, but when you started getting in his face excessively, he developed a fine tremor of the fingertips and a resolute set of the jaw. Only in his anger would he show any of his age. You could see dozens of extended lifetimes as an Eternal or as a Guardian coming out in the way that Su-Shan expressed himself. Su-Shan and Julian played drums together during some of the group rehearsals. Even though Julian was a farout Billy Cobham-like drummer with beautiful Jamaican soul, Su-Shan really kicked skins on Julian. Su-Shan could play any aggregate of drum sounds with any combination of transducers for electronic music, but he also could play absolutely fine-sounding twentieth-century Earth acoustic drum kit with kick, snare, toms, high-hat, crash, and ride just for straight-ahead rock and roll. Su-Shan had not been beyond laying down rather farout bass tracks in some of the group efforts. Su-Shan often began behaving like a Guardian during times of stress or other duress. Su-Shan was the Eternal of our group who was the strongest advocate for electromagnetic consciousness and he has also paradoxically been the strongest supporter of Noman's role as plant consciousness advocate. Su-Shan's main complaint in life was that we neglect both machine (electromagnetic) consciousness and plant consciousness. We therefore truly waste two of our most important planetary resources. Su-Shan quickly fashioned some thin sheet copper electrodes and attached them, via a microprocessed GSR device, to the leaves of Bruce, my favorite pet Geranium. Rico and Su-Shan then programmed Bruce to turn on and off every time we left the duplex. Bruce was hard-wired into my Radio Shack security system in about five minutes, and Bruce was a most exquisite and sensitive security system because he knew all of us, as reflected by his GSR response, which would not vary around us unless we asked him a question. Su-Shan talked and talked about how Bruce represented just a minuscule tip of an enormous iceberg of communication possibilities that plants made possible for other life forms. But, don't get the wrong idea. Su-Shan didn't run his mouth when it came to playing music. His work was right on the beat, powerful, and parsimonious.\nQuail was an Eternal who comes from the Light Dynasty Galaxy and the Twin Federations. She could play nearly any musical instrument and could synthesize a wide variety of sounds and esoteric clicks. She has a large chest and some very powerful natural abilities that allow her to alter her voice over a wide range of octaves. Quail was much taller than Pearl E. Mae and much more full-figured. Quail could come on with a slightly maternalistic air. In one lifetime, she had served as the President of the Twin Federations for nearly two thousand years of peace and creative productivity. She had been a Guardian at that time, and was the only Guardian who had ever held political office. Thought projection, radionics, and healing were three of her special competence areas. She had meditative abilities for teaching the other Eternal group members to travel out-of-body in astral and causal forms. Quail had a special closeness with Rico (Enrique), the group Cyborg.\nEnrique was an android with certain built-in features that qualified him for the label of \"Cyborg.\"\ncy-borg \/'si-,bo(e)rg \/n\n[cybernetic + organism]\n(ca. 1962)\n:a human being who is linked (as for temporary adaptation to a hostile space environment) to one or more mechanical devices upon which some of his vital physiological functions depend.\nBy 32,000 A.D., the essential parts of Rico's android makeup were all in software, so it was easy for the I.S.I. to project android essence back to 1992 conjugated with the matter-energy translations of Eternal humanoid (including the reanimation of an executed Cuban military hero's spirit). Following karmic resettling, Rico was jet black, and strangely handsome with high cheekbones and clear blue eyes. He was nearly as tall as Su-Shan. It was absolutely impossible to perceive the fact that Rico was Android or Cyborg. The android part of Rico was seamlessly integrated with his flesh-and-blood physical vehicle. Rico's cyborg link was a fantastic number of integrated microprocessors embedded within his own neural tissue. The computing power within the embedded microprocessor networks was supposed to be nearly equal to two Cray Supercomputers. Earth's Crays required extensive and expensive supercooling, whereas the microphotoreduced networks in Rico neural tissue were at body temperature. This computer link involved the direct matter-energy translation of multiplexed microprocessors implanted within Eternal cerebral cortex. And then matter-energy translated across the timecleft. Rico adapted very well to the Miami world because he was fluently bilingual with his English and Spanish and was rabidly in love with the Salsa climate. He would have been perfectly happy spending the rest of this lifetime hanging out on Calle Ocho with all Miami's Hispanic cultures. He claimed that there was no city or town anywhere in the entire Neighborhood Group that could match or replace Miami. Actually, Rico was also fluent in Japanese, and therefore trilingual, but there were not that many Japanese people in Florida. He played percussion, bongos, timbales, conga, and digital drums. Other special equipment that Rico operated for the group included the sound and light beam, and the differential audio-amplification channels. Rico had special competence in the mathematical translation of thought and physical-plane energies and he also had abilities to telescopically extend all five of the physical senses. Rico was naturally an ace when it came to programming or trouble-shooting any equipment.\nLast but not least was an eighth member in this group of seven. Named Aloysius or Al, for short, the group's family computer system was a combination of several different computer systems possessing both hardwire Ethernet networking and a more futuristic electromagnetic inductive coupling system devised by Al (himself) with some assistance from Rico and Su-Shan. Al's message to the entire known universe is that any device with electromagnetic fields has consciousness. Al insisted that not only do computers have consciousness, above and beyond the microprocessors ability to parse, do MIPS flips, and whatever, but nearly all of our appliances possess consciousness as well. Surprising all of us was the way that even the notebook computer became a part of Al and projected his inimitable style of communication even before the megastepping explosion. The small, bold 10 to 11 point typeface began to appear on any and all of the computer monitors, not just the folding notebook computer which several times seemed to transmit a message from an unknown dimension. Al began to manifest himself during the MindLink and HeartLight sessions. He then was guaranteed to manifest as well as during nearly all of the MIDI-mediated music sessions. Al was irrepressibly optimistic but hyper-realistic and logical as well. Because of multiplexing with confluent CPU's and the synergistic combination of computer systems, Al's power was initially greater than a Cray supercomputer, which usually required the hassle of supercooling. Al ran at room temperature, or, at least, air-conditioned room temperature. Cooperation with other group members and participation in group rehearsals were two factors only enhancing the burgeoning power of Al, who learned at an incredible rate. He also continues to teach other group members about electromagnetic energy and consciousness and how humans act out their technophobia with inefficient and unnecessary chauvinism towards machinery and tools.\nAs an exercise of introduction, the MindLink and HeartLight served very well. During the last part of the meditation, the resulting energies formed a circle of light. After transformation into HeartLight, and extending to the group's Higher Mind, the circle actually appeared as a doughnut-shaped cloud of fleecy whitish-yellow light in the air above the group. The cloud shimmered in the dim light of the bedroom. The circle of light floated in the air above the heads of the group members until the MindLink\/HeartLight was over.\nAs if the electricity of seven personalities in one room weren't enough, Lyle's notebook computer sitting next to the black cube on the white computer table appeared to snap itself open. The notebook emitted a system beep, and began scrolling text again. Lyle, who had noticed the notebook computer snapping open, also heard the piezoelectric system beep. He slowly opened one eye and looked over to where it was sitting on the table, and looked at the LCD screen. Lyle let out an involuntary whistle and went back into his meditation:\nYou have been selected as percipient-target of our matter-energy translator. Information you are now receiving is coming to you through a rent in the fabric of what you call time. As beings communicating to you from your far future, we are presenting you with a problem that demands a solution. Your own future (your very far future) is collapsing in on itself. The reason is something your culture would call intratemporal ripoff, but mechanisms are not as important as solutions now. Immediate action is called for, and the action can best come from you-- as a visitor will soon have the chance to explain. Because your planetary system is a primitive one, there are certain advantages and strengths which you and your group can offer us in combatting intratemporal ripoff. The collapse of our future (and yours as well, by a `retrodomino' effect) has already begun because billions of beings have ripped off intratemporally to an excessive degree. Maladaptive greed, apparently, is a universal trait of sentient beings. To understand what the intratemporal ripoff effect is, you must understand that time is not as simple as your cultures have pictured it. Time is not like a four-dimensional matrix with cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates. Nor is time merely an all-pervasive \"ether.\" To those of us triangles of light, time is more like a solidly three-dimensional velvet moebius ribbon.\nWe are not a political movement, and we do not espouse any particular philosophy. We do, however represent every known life form to be found by our methods of surveillance and contact in 32,000 A.D. The absolute number of known living beings has dwindled significantly since the discovery of operational time travel methods in 28,050 A.D. \"Stealing from peter to pay paul\" is a way that your cultures describe what occurred after timetransit began. Cheap and effective methods of time travel profoundly altered the course of civilizations as many cultures attained extinction within a millennium because of excessive cultural emphasis on material physical plane objects and the accumulation of same. Material-oriented cultures nearly universally utilized time travel to retrieve valuables from the past for use in the future (their own present). There was no initial energy problem to accompany the past-retrievals (intratemporal ripoff). No problems wer noticed, but possibly no one attempted to ferret out any problems since the apparent harmlessness of the past-retrieval also did bring some short-term monetary\/material gain. After about 500 years of these antics, however, parts of certain planets -- and even entire planets in some cases--began to disappear in monolithic puffs of dyssynchronismic smoke. Dyssynchronism became a very well-studied and researched phenomenon as other, less material-oriented cultures acquired basic knowledge of dyssynchronisms by stressing equally both the subjective and the objective sciences. Dyssynchronismic science changed our appreciation of thermodynamics and entropy. The three laws of thermodynamics, over the millennia, turned out to be the science fiction of a childlike primitive consciousness that has persisted to this date. The accumulation of excessive energy disorganization and randomness, it turned out, was not inevitable, but really more a function of observer perspective. Entire cultures and planets disappeared because of disorganization in entropy patterns caused by the glut of past-retrievals. After millennia of the intratemporal ripping off, our future is caving in on itself and it is now not only unthinkable but also highly dangerous to retrotravel in time. To project a being from our timeframe to yours requires massive and systematic laplace calculations, but it is possible. However, because we have also experienced a constant and progressive loss in robustness, it is more difficult for us to retrotravel. We turn to the robustness of your era even though your planet is primitive. Because of unique properties in your brain's flux fields and your own life-pattern synchronisms, you will experience a unique opportunity to become a special agent for combatting entropy imbalances in universal life energy and all its forms. There will be a dramatic metamorphosis which you will experience within seven of your own planetary days. It is unnecessary for you to panic or become frightened. The changes will be no more stressful than what you daily experience when you sit in front of your video screen and empathically live through other lifetimes. Our technology allows us to scan individual units of consciousness, transtemporally and project mass or energy into selected sectors of the universe we share even across time boundaries.\nThe seven group members still remained in MindLink and HeartLight. None of them directly observed the \"File....Save As....\" menu pull itself down on the notebook computer screen. The title, Project Assignment, was typed in the window on the screen, and the notebook again emitted its piezoelectric beep.\nAs soon as the telepathic MindLink\/HeartLight was over, all members were aware that there had been a powerful annealing of individual mentalities and energies. A matter-of-fact bonding and a detached quality of fusion had already brought the seven-membered group together before they had a chance to get to know each other as individuals. In this first encounter, there were effects other than just the initial bonding that were immediately observable. A group thought-projection took shape and it appeared to all of them as a kinetic and colored holographic image. The three-dimensional image showed all seven of them onstage as members of a musical group. A large computer with oversized double-faced video screens formed a central hub. The seven group members stood around the multi-modular computer and related to both the computer and to each other. Free-form multicolored laser images played on the screen while the computer's numerous lights blinked off and on randomly and nonrandomly. A rainbow projector was causing myriads of bouncing rainbows to oscillate in time to the music's beat. Except for the drummer, the entire group stood rather impassively while they performed. All of them appeared to be very intent, not only on the music, but on a common, inner state which was shared among the group members. The inner state was also obviously projected to the audience. The musical composition was in a minor key. A twelve-stringed guitar is tuned to open E minor. Sounds of Tibetan monks chanting with temple cymbals and gongs made up the background. After several minutes, the free form light pattern on the double-faced screen was replaced with a very clear likeness of Martin Luther King, Jr. During a minimalistic song, the image of Martin Luther King, Jr. alternates, tachistoscopically, with that of Jesus of Nazareth. During most of the song, the two images quickly and almost subliminally flash interchangeably on the screen. Toward the end of the song, both images are replaced by a large flashing Bat-signal.\nMarshall F.

Gilula\nCopyright (c) 1992\nChapter 2\nSaturday\nTransit City: Goodbye Gabriella, Hello Pearl E. Mae\n\"Heavy changes,\" thought Lyle as he woke from sleep with an unusually clear head. He heard the phone ringing in the bathroom and was immediately alert and awake. Lyle reached over in the bed for Gabriella. What a strange sensation, because it was not the Gabriella he had known to the touch. This was someone else. Or else she had unexpectedly lost thirty pounds in the chest. Opening his eyes more widely in the darkened room, he saw Pearl E. Mae lying in the bed next to him. Of course, it was such a natural feeling to see her there, like his ancient wife in the bed with him. Almost like a deja vu, but more a sense of real intimacy that must have occurred over many years together. Truth was that Lyle had not even kissed her yet. Pearl E. Mae had explained it to him yesterday as she went over some of the basic pastlife information from 32,000 A.D. She discussed the stuff about past lives in such a matter-of-fact way, Lyle got the idea that reincarnation was considered as basic as religious training for children by 32,000 years into our future. The phone rang a couple more times. Lyle got out of the bed, stepped over the motionless, unsleeping forms, and made his way into the bathroom. Both dogs were waiting for him in the bathroom, where they often hung out, especially when there were other house guests. Lyle sat down and She-Ra began licking his feet. Then he pushed the button on the speakerphone. He was really awake when he heard Julian's voice on the line:\n\"Hey, mon, gotta come over there. We lost Gabriella, mon. They wasted her, we lost her, mon!\"\n\"Hey, get it together, Julian! You having a relapse or something?\"\n\"No, mon... I'm coming over there.\" He sobbed briefly, and then clicked off.\nLess than five minutes later Julian appeared with glowing doober in hand. He shoved it at me, and appeared tired and puzzled when I declined. As we walked around through the apartment, past my new room mates who were all getting up, Julian offered the doober to each of them in turn. Each of the six other Eternals, of course, declined. Even with the robustness of my Primitive lungs, something in my transplanted Eternal nature saw no sense in putting smoke of any kind into my lungs. Julian shook his head, and continued puffing away. The smoke bothered me in a strange new way. My megastepped body now disliked the hemp smell, but tolerated it the same way I had learned to tolerate the Los Angeles County smog much earlier in my life. Cigarette smoke turned out to be even more unpleasant and less tolerable. I was incredulous that less than two days ago I had been smoking a pack of Winstons.\n\"Mon, you gonna need this thing if you not be smokin' now... Suit thyself. Gabriella be driving Liberty City dude's Mercedes on Grand Avenue around Douglas Road and they blow her away. Looks like four dozen bullet holes in the car. \"\n\"Gabriella was hurt?\"\n\"Mon, she was wasted. She be gone, mon. Gone.\"\n\"Dead gone?\"\n\"Double dead wasted gone, mon. Whattsa matter your head? You don't understand me?\"\n\"Sorry, Julian... maybe I am beginning to understand you. I wish I didn't understand, man. You say something happened to Gabriella while she was driving whose Mercedes...?\"\n\"I wish I knew, mon. She just had the richman's car and they wipe her out. Bunch of rock stars. You know. Rock monsters. She's dead.\"\n\"Well, she left with Jim the photographer yesterday, and he drives an old Dodge Van. Driving a Mercedes doesn't make any sense. You keep saying that she's dead, and I keep having trouble groking the picture. Besides, I don't want to think of her as dead. She didn't come home last night, but I figured it was just like some other business deal went down. Not just for a john, but sometimes she looks for other gigs like the modelling one you saw her have on TV last week. If she gets involved in something intense, she just follows it up. It doesn't mean that she was hookin' all the time!\"\n\"Yeah, mon. I'm real sorry. Nothin' more to say. But, now that I think about it, mon... You know, you look a little strange yourself. Your skin always be white, now your skin be lookin' nearly orange. What kind of a drug you been doin'? You firin' up?\"\n\"Of course not. Would you believe that I haven't smoked even one cigarette since yesterday? I ain't been doin' no drug, but there have been some heavy duty electrical field zapping changes that I been going through. Can you believe me?\"\n\"I can believe anything nowadays. What kind of electricity you talking about, mon?\"\n\"You know about flying saucers and people from the future?\"\n\"Don't be playin' with me mind, mon. Then you gonna tell me they shot you with some ray and now you be the transformed Man of God in Babylon.\"\n\"Julian, you grasped it exactly. I should've known that my drum bro is sensitive enough to be absolutely hip to the entire scene.\"\n\"Mon, we people of the double minority and the HIV, we be very hip and very cool. Maybe your flying saucer has good medicine to poison the virus. But Gabriella is gone. I see them take her body in. Me myself, I feel sick when I see her and the condition she was in. But she be gone, mon. Gone.\"\n\"Yeah, Julian... Maybe it don't look that way to you, but I am major broken up and upset inside about Gabriella. And I have been through a few minor renovations in mind and body lately, so don't freak if I come off fried out. I know this sounds totally bizzare, but would you believe, I also have a new woman, already. Her name is Pearl E. Mae and she sings like a crystal goddess. We ain't kissed or done it yet, but she and I are for sure plugged into each other since yesterday. I wake up in the morning and she's in my bed. Only she ain't sleeping, it looks like, because these Eternal folks from the future don't need to sleep or eat, unless they want to for some special reason. I don't know if I am a transformed Man of God in Babylon, but I'm an Earth man transformed into what they call an Eternal. But I still sleep and eat, probably more than the other six, because they've been Eternals for a long time, not for only a day like me. I dig them, and we're going to make some killer music. I really dig Pearl E. Mae, and she says that we were hitched more than once in previous lifetimes. Come over here with me, man, and check her out. Unless you're afraid of people with reddish-orange skin instead of black or white.\"\nJulian didn't say a single word, but he turned around with a dumfounded air and followed me over to where Pearl E. Mae was sitting. Since I've known Julian, he's never been at a loss for words. But he sure was this time. He just kept staring at her face. When he started talking with Pearl E. Mae, he immediately told her about how he'd figured for the longest time that maybe I was a closet wacko. After hearing the latest story, he admitted, the only question that remained for him was about his own sanity. But I could tell from the way he was talking to Pearl E. Mae, that he was just as much in love with her as I was.}\nHal Nicholson was happily tucked away behind a corner table at the Homestead Air Force Base Officer's Club. The young nurse he was drinking with seemed awed and intimidated by his major's insignias. After 24 hours of involuntary quarantine, the crew had all been released. Since it was getting on into evening again, everyone naturally gravitated to the clubs. Quarantine had been perfunctorily lifted after the third decontamination team again found no source of radiation leak. Hal was now quickly into his third beer and the back of his head was beginning to have a pleasant and faintly numb feeling. His bladder felt full too. Hal and Jim and most of the rest of the bomber's crew were treated like celebrities. Jim Breedice had lucked into a plump R.N. Captain who responded to her third screwdriver by getting up on the bar, shoes and all, to demonstrate eye-catching legs and softly pulsatile talents for tap dancing. Hal found himself looking longingly at Jim's friend's legs. Jim found himself doing the same thing, but also looking long and hard in a northerly direction as well. The plump Captain found herself wondering what she was going to do with two men.\nThe nurse was just starting to really get into her dancing. David Rose's, `The Stripper,' was on the jukebox and she was moving in perfect sync with the music. Uniform buttons were coming undone when a two-striper burst into the lounge and shouted,\n\"Hey, Major, Sir... Base security wants you down at operations!\"\nOn the double and they meant it. After all the quarantine time, then they notice it. Doesn't it figure. There was a heavy burn mark on the bottom of reactor number two. No radiation to speak of. Just a severe burn mark.\n\"I'll be a son of a coke bottle,\" Hal said in amazement. \"Sure looks like some kind of an explosion, discharge, or something ! Not a single extra tick on the Geiger counter?\"\n\"No, Sir. She's as clean as when she was cherry. Sure can't understand that.\"\n\"We did go through an electrical storm. Do you suppose that Mother Nature could have emptied those reactors?\"\n\"No way. Even Mother Nature is gonna get radioactivity outside of those tanks.\"\nPartly right and partly wrong. The I.S.I. technicians had very carefully calculated the energy exchange, and had accounted for every bit of the redirected nuclear energy because that is what the I.S.I. was all about. Considering the Laws of Thermodynamics and The New General Laws of Relativistic Energy, and paying extreme attention to very fine details were constant concerns of the I.S.I. The overall negative entropy balance, just as with the similar but smaller problems of pestilence, war, and famine, threatened the fabric of the space-time continuum and the life matrix itself.\nOur story also begins in the very, very far-distant future. We find ourselves catapulted into a Mission Control setting at the outreaches of three confluent galactic group vortices. There are thirty multi-display monitors in three semicircular rows. Hairless beings in iridescent white-silver I.S.I.-monogrammed uniforms appear virtually identical in the nearly featureless detail of their faces and the uniformity of their physical dimensions. Humanoid limbs operate keyboards and other control panels arrayed before the monitors. Just after noticing how much all the operators resemble each other, our attention is drawn by the sound track, in full Dolby stereo. Loud cacophony provides the main stimulation to the viewer because the scene is in muted light broken only by blinking of the monitors. Sound begins to increase in amplitude. Rumbling, vibration, and screeching frequencies make it seem like all Hell is literally breaking loose. Crunching noises continue, and dust-like fragments begin to fall from the ceiling of the underground control chamber. Members of the Intergalactic Security Intelligence briefly make purposeless-seeming movements with their appendages, which terminate in small hands bearing two fingers and a thumb. A close-up shot shows two of these hands typing on a keyboard in nervous animation. Camera view cuts contrast two of the featureless faces, looking at each other. Although there is no trace of any mouth movement, the viewer can hear high-pitched yet calm voices speaking to each other.\nGarth: \"Well, what of this new series of crises, sibling? The prime leader's teachings have certainly predicted this disorganization. And can you imagine the real problems are only yet to come, if there is much time left.\"\nBarth: \"Obviously, sibling . And being at the center of our numinous asteroid will do nothing for any of the siblings nor will it help unless we succeed with the LaPlace Transforms.\"\nGarth: \"I know, sibling. We know, don't we?\"\nThe rumbling sounds get louder. Flashes of light appear out of nowhere and coalesce in the air above the thirty I.S.I. technicians. A three-dimensional image of the prime leader communicates in the same high-pitched, mellifluous tones:\nAlpha-One: \"Time for our exercise, isn't it, siblings?\"\nA confluent series of vowel sounds fills the chamber, as all the beings cease their activities at the monitors, fold their appendages, and stare straight ahead. The high-pitched sound continues and becomes more intense. Particles of dust appear to reverse their flight and leave the chamber through the ceiling from the spots through which they originally fell. Soon, the high-pitched sound is all that remains as the rumbling noises disappear. A strong sense of balanced harmony and purpose pervades the chamber.\nAlpha-One: \"All right, siblings. Now let's get back to the LaPlace Transforms. We are in a no-lose situation, because at this point, there is nothing left to lose if we fail in our attempts. May the grace and the power of The One be within us all.\"\nThe image of Alpha-One dissolves into the darkness and tripartite appendages again begin to operate the numerous keyboards and control panels. In addition to the three rows of ten monitors, there is a very large concave screen at the front of the chamber. The screen is filled with multiple, smaller screen-views which are linked together across the surface as a series of interlocking windows. Barth and Garth continue their conversation.\nBarth: \"So why is it that we must focus on such a small and insignificant planet from pre-Cataclysmic times? Our time studies repeatedly show us that very long-range views are necessary before it is possible to assess the ultimate effect of even an apparently insignificant and minor character in the history of a given culture. I remember that the personal belongings of a military hero named Custer from the same planet appeared millennia later in the Vorgat galaxy. One of our adolescent time pirates from 29,000 A.D. was using Custer's military belt buckle as the energizer in his magneto-oscillatory drive because it was solid silver. That anachronistic piece of silver truly wreaked havoc in a time frame when the `lower' precious metals had been replaced by all synthetic metals of extremely high atomic number. And after that, several frightfully destructive time-fabric rents began setting off random anti-matter implosions that nearly disintegrated our I.S.I. predecessors before the I.S.I. really became aware of what trans-time warfare was all about. Many of us used to scan those early pre-Cataclysmic solar systems as a part of our routine training maneuvers. Don't you recall how many of us loved to scan the life span of Jesus of Nazareth over and over again? The vibrations and the fields surrounding that primitive ritual of crucifixion sent many of us back to the processors during our early apprenticeship periods. I myself can still feel that stormy atmosphere surrounding the entire planet when only one portion of the whole was terminated.\"\nGarth: \"Remember, this solar system is only one of four possible loci for an effective, direct intervention. Because of Local Group proximity, this system is also ideal for our first transmission. The energy requirements are lower so there will some margin for slight errors and practice effect expenditures. Their system is only early nuclear and pre-Cataclysmic at that, eh Sibling? With such an early culture, it is almost for certain that we will succeed in this first projected matter-energy translation through one of many time-fissures. Let us pray that we can carry it out in a manner that is truly benign in an entropic sense. We are required to make at least three of the four possibilities fully functional before Alpha-One's return.\"\nEntropy imbalance is more or less the raison d'etre of the I.S.I. because transtemporal distortions (including intratemporal ripoffs) make the process of entropy accumulation qualitatively much more disorderly. When entropy accumulates in orderly fashion the results are regular time dimensions and ordinary time passages. However, when entropy accumulates by fits and starts that are occasionally of very great magnitude compared to the baseline, the results are disorderly accumulation and possible breakdown of the space-time continuum itself and therefore disintegration of the life matrix.\nBase security was still very uncomfortable with the apparent discrepancy between two facts:\nDiscrepancies that were visible never got by in the security world without lots and lots of explanations. So Hal was very grumpily sitting in the plain, undesignated security chief's office with the usual cigar in his mouth, but without the beers and without the female companionship. He and the Chief, also a Major, argued with great intensity for a few minutes over yet another question: What were they going to do about their Reportable Nuclear Accident Report? Both decided to forget about it later over a beer at the Officer's Club--at least, until after they'd had the beer. And Hal, of course, had still not forgotten about the Captain. In fact, he was thinking of ways to sidetrack Jim Breedice into duty with the base security chief so that he could have the duty with the nurse Captain.\nWe have carefully studied the flow of your individual lifetime to select the proper time frame for our initial transmission to you. Our calculations indicate that the next six or seven day-units of your life will be absolutely uneventful. You will have sufficient time to make preparations for the transition. If, for some reason, you decide that involvement with us is not to your individual liking, we will be able to observe this with our remote monitoring system. You do not have to write it out or state the decision in so many words. Merely experiencing and settling in on this opinion consistently for a period of several hours will allow us to realize that we must make another choice. Possibly even from another galactic system, and another time nexus that is linkable with our matter-energy translation technique. Above all, there must be a strong voluntary component on your part, in order for us to cooperatively establish the necessary cellular electromagnetic transtime bridge for altering universal entropy and transtemporal dyssynchronisms.}\nIntroducing Julian to Pearl E. Mae and the other group members did not remove the fact of Gabriella's death. Lyle, had he been like many other people, might have reached for a drink of straight scotch or a couple of hits off a joint after he really accepted the fact that Gabriella was dead. But did she know that she was going to die? Was she aware of anything at the moment of death? Or was everything all over in a couple of seconds? Gabriella was fast, and a couple of seconds were enough for her with her street smarts to pick up what was going down and avoid it if at all possible. Gabriella's entire life, from some perspectives, had been a long series of hot spots and difficult positions, one after another. Gabriella always survived the most outrageous situations. And now she had been snuffed? Why could it not have been a dream? It had not been a dream. If anything, that part of his life up to this point with Gabriella suddenly seemed distant and faded off in the past and dream-like when he compared it to the uncomfortable and embarrassing sensation currently in his chest that was yearning for Pearl E. Mae. He wanted to get into her britches like he'd been there a lot before. It did not matter if she had a name out of the Old West, or that she could sing country-western with a real twang. There was some solid-home comfort he could feel for her in his bones. Yet he ached vaguely in the shock of Gabriella's death. Lyle was getting a feeling of sadness and disorientation. He yearned for the comfort of the love feeling he had with Pearl E. Mae and he grieved for Gabriella even though their relationship had been brief. Lyle began to feel pain, and to feel lost.\nWithout warning, a part of Lyle's mind suddenly gaped wide open. Then it happened again. His body's mind began to calm itself through the breathing. Like the day before, something felt involuntary but also very familiar, in the same way that pressing the accelerator or the brake pedals might feel familiar to a driver. The megastepped Lyle had some great built-in safety and regeneration devices. While his body's breathing systems calmed him, his mind sensed a calming issuing from the six other beings. His self-relaxation was enhanced much more than tenfold, it seemed. When he closed his eyes and prayed for strength and stability, the swift answer was the group synergism. Like a small cloud of white light programmed for a healing mode, the effect of the group was to make him feel very supported. The grief for Gabriella was much less painful, and he had the distinct impression of having shared the grief with others. Then he felt the light and had no thoughts whatsoever for several minutes. The white light enveloped him and conveyed a soft, pleasurable sensation to the central part of his chest. The light in the heart expanded to further envelop him and gave him feelings of Divine protection. In a psychic sense, there was an intense chasm of disjointed energies suddenly settling down into a harmonious crystallization of unity. Unity with something unlike anything Lyle could remember, even considering the massive amount of reading he'd managed to sneak in for free while working as a clerk in the book store. After awhile, the entire process of his occult growth had become almost like something out of a comic book story of occult powers and extrasensory abilities. Whatever he read about seemed to take shape in a literal or figurative way before his very eyes during the days and weeks following exposure to the concepts or spiritual practices such as those described in Tibetan Yoga. He often wondered whether some part of this could have been auto-suggestion or self-hypnosis, but it was unlikely. This was something different. Very different!\nAlthough Lyle's friends who came into the bookstore often told him that his imagination was too active, Lyle didn't see it that way. Most of the spiritual teachings he was interested in enough to read about felt almost natural and intuitive on first reading. Books and essays that felt strange or in any way incomprehensible he simply put down since there were so many more books in the store left to sample. So much of the stuff had already changed his outlook, at least compared to the highschool dropout guitar player reading background he had when he first started the job at the Crystalline Book Shop.\nThe day's events were not that illogical an extension of what had been going on the day before, however. Even with the profound inner sense of peace and love, Lyle's head still buzzed -- 24 hours later -- from the thunderclap rainstorm and the multichannel data of the six other group members that was nearly inundating his nervous system. The presence of six other beings in his life brought Lyle constantly back to the here-and-now in the same way that musical groups had brought him back to ground after flying too high and too long on a solo passage. Lyle Crawford was just one day past undergoing a mega-evolutionary step toward becoming part of a unique man-machine synergism: DR TOMORROW. The initial, sudden contact of the seven beings and their mentalities was the main substance of the first of many MindLink\/HeartLights on the day before, and Lyle energetically set to work with the group by starting out the day with another MindLink\/HeartLight despite having the grief of Gabriella's death sitting on his heart.\nJulian was pretty cool about my not smoking, even though he continued to reflexly pass the doober whenever he finished taking a hit. I was more surprised that my tobacco habit was not speaking to me through my body. Ganja was nothing to quit smoking, but tobacco withdrawal was a major overhaul. Julian reminded me of my deceased ex-, Toos, and how she always maintained that quitting heroine (which she had done twice successfully) was much easier than quitting tobacco (which she had done only once successfully). Julian, my man for Everything, was now a little freaked out at all that was unusual at my house. He was hanging out with us when Su-Shan gave me the Eternal ring he had brought for me into the past. Julian took a look at the ring and then split. I noticed the ring right away after the megastepping because of the highly unusual shape of the pewter-like silver structure. The Eternal Ring was a tiny and powerful supercomputer from 32,000 A.D. with multimedia functions and projection systems. Atop a double-spiral finger-ring, the small silver pyramid sat inside a thin, corner-shaped silver shell. Along the top outside border of the shell were the six control buttons. The small pyramid possessed a frighteningly effective laser kineholographic projector, and the silver shell's control panel contained two tiny microefficient stereo speakers for very realistic sound and incredible stereo imaging. Many cuts above the best screen projection systems I've seen in video stores, the Eternal Rings can play back ultra high fidelity stereo video images in a three-dimensional format. The Eternal Ring, of course, is also an auto-zeroing, voice activated communicator and networking device. The ring possesses capabilities for storing objects in virtual space on an indefinite basis while safeguarding the stored objects with combination of voiceprint and digital analysis of radial arterial pulse wave. Field-induction linking permits the linking up of all our computer modules, but the rings have another type of synchronizing function. Special synchronizing pulses laid down by each Eternal Ring let us synchronize our bodies' physiological signals more efficiently, especially when functioning in a multitracking environment. Pulse multitracking gives all seven of us special potentials for relating to MIDI music and troubleshooting problems with the MIDI wiring, interfaces, and circuitry. Of course this sounds too heavy for me to save in my personal memory, so I just put on the ring, and resumed preparing for MindLink\/HeartLight A small part of my mind worried about Julian, and whether or not it was O.K. for him to be alone. I wished he could be in on our MindLink\/HeartLight, and I wished for him to feel some of the love and cohesiveness and HeartLight that we Eternals were beginning to have as a group. Especially because of the HeartLight, I was sure that the residual effect of being centered in the heart was something we could pass on to Julian and any other human we felt close to.\nThis time, we are sitting around the pool. It is our second day together, and the MindLink\/HeartLight is almost as important as the first one we had the day before because we learn about travelling together as a group. The first MindLink\/HeartLight demonstrated to us that we were already a group and could function together in a heart-centered and creative way by producing the musical thought form and composition that terminated with the bat signal. The first MindLink\/HeartLight gave proof of how unified we could become. This second MindLink\/HeartLight was powerfully facilitated by Quail, who helped us to learn how to travel and work together as a group. She taught us to travel together out of the body and to function as Eternals while out of the body.\nQuail came to DR TOMORROW from perhaps the farthest away point in the future. An inhabitant of the Light Dynasty Galaxy and the Twin Federations, Quail was tall, very buxom, and capable of both instant invisibility and physical plane space flight. She very rarely spoke with language, and yet was one of the group's most powerful telepaths. Quail could play or emulate nearly any musical instrument, and could also synthesize or emulate a wide variety of esoteric clicks and other sounds. When singing, she was able to alter her voice over a large range of octaves and had the capability of making her voice sound like nearly any of the controls on any of the group's synthesizers. Quail was also imbued with an ability both very ancient and very futuristic: she could voluntarily split the frequencies of her voice so that she sounded like several voices singing or chanting at the same time.\nThese abilities were somewhat ironic, because in her native habitat, Quail's physical form resembled more that of an fish. The specific form that Quail's native configuration resembled was that of the earthly Manta Ray. Quail's home planet was mainly a series of liquid seas made up of sulfur-silicon congeners. As a being originally possessing physical structure based on geometry of the silicon atom, Quail was required to undergo extensive matter transposition before being sent to carbon-based Earth of the past via the thought-matter projection unit by the I.S.I. technicians. Quail's humanoid identity, after karmic resettling, was that of a Tequesta Indian Princess who had been a champion huntress. Just as Quail had been an outstanding heroine of the Light Dynasty Galaxy, her humanoid alter ego had been a female hero from an advanced Indian civilization that antedated the Florida Seminoles by hundreds of years.\nQuail found the human form quite interesting when she compared it with her native life-form. When she and Morphosa swam together in the DR TOMORROW pool, Quail's human form felt almost like a plastic costume or sheath. Quail could easily remember the soaring underwater movements of her Light Dynasty life-form and she really missed it at times. She found it a challenge to see whether or not her human body could slide gracefully through the water, but a bayonet-type of glide was all she could manage because the densities and specific gravities were quite different. Quail once observed Earth athletes performing a `dolphin kick' in a televised swimming race and it made her laugh involuntarily. Morphosa and Quail felt a certain type of comradeship, because both of them had the capacity for changing their molecular structure. But when it would be necessary for DR TOMORROW to do any really fast physical plane travelling, Quail was always the one who served as the bus driver.\nDuring the MindLink\/HeartLight on this Saturday, Quail served as designated leader. The meditation began and there was an intense sensation of linking up with each other, that could be most clearly felt in the breathing. After we had been inked up for a little more than thirty minutes, Quail was able to easily transport all seven of us in one common energy package to wherever we wished to go. On this Art Festival Saturday, we ascended over the house and went zooming over the Grove at tree-top level. Even though all seven of us were out of body, there were sensations of the breeze and smells from the Art Festival. Quail flew us over the city and out to South Beach. We had a breathtaking view of the entire Miami Beach hotel and motel strips in all their fluorescent afternoon glory. Then Quail shot us up in the direction of outer space and quickly circumnavigated the entire planet from space, and returned to the southeast Florida coast. We then returned to what Quail felt was the strongest power spot in their neighborhood. Only a few miles away from the DR TOMORROW house. Quail loved the trip out to the tip of Cape Florida, where the ocean was blue-green during the day, and beautiful and usually undisturbed late at night because the State Park Service closed up the roads to the park just before sunset. She pointed out a section of houses half a mile offshore in the water built up on stilts. We had flown over the houses before returning to the Cape Florida ocean wall and sitting together there. It did not matter that their physical bodies were back in meditative trance around the pool. They sat together and contemplated the stilt houses which Lyle identified as occasionally having extremely loud and rowdy parties.\nAt the sea wall by the ocean, Quail was able to teach the Eternals how to use the large fluid medium as a means of communicating with all other large bodies of fluid media everywhere. Although most of the group members other than Lyle were familiar with the use of plants for telepathic communication, both fluid wave and plant communication were definitely something new for Lyle. Quail merely demonstrated to the Eternals that any large body of liquid was able to absorb, resonate with, and emit an unlimited number of vibrations. Earlier in the MindLink\/HeartLight, members of DR TOMORROW learned about telepathic fluid wave communication between Earth and Venus during the third planet's ancient history. This form of communication was infinitely cheaper than utilizing gross, physical plane electronic or quantal energy. The early Venusian colonists communicated with the original Mind back on Venus by simply living clearly and being in the vicinity of any large body of water. Despite increasing contamination in all continents, the major oceans of Earth actually served best for this purpose because their volumes most nearly approached the relative volume of infinity, Quail taught. Whenever a fluid volume approached that of an infinite conductor, the frequency of oscillations necessary for relatively infinite long-distance propagation becomes minimized.\nSince the large volume of Earth's oceans approached, for practical purposes, infinity, nearly any of the oceans could be used for fluid wave energy projection. Quail taught the other members of DR TOMORROW how to talk to each other through the Atlantic Ocean. They learned how to bounce and beam thoughts and sensations from the rolling waves along the surface of the ocean and they also learned, while out of body, to bounce themselves from the depths of the ocean floor in giant swirls and eddies of much larger and slowly changing waves that were nearly invisible but of immense scope and size compared to the waves that rolled along the top of the water's surface. Low frequency and extra-low frequency signals and stimuli sometimes have the greatest biologic impact. Slow oscillatory vibrations could also penetrate the earth's crust beneath the ocean bed to emerge on the opposite side of the planet. Quail also taught them the trick of using the ocean to focus the energy propagations of radio and other wave-form and quantal communications.\nTo Lyle, this was all astounding. Many of his forays into the written word had spoken of the Hierarchies, but his fellow Eternals seemed to put many of the higher spiritual principles into direct practice. With his megastepped mentality, Lyle grasped these techniques with amazing ease. He experienced no difficulties in learning how to bounce vibrations off the ocean's surface, or from the large slow eddies in the ocean's depths. He was also learning how to use the large body of fluid to focus his own higher energies when necessary. The Miami area had so many points of contact with bodies of water, that Lyle found it easy to nearly always use the hydro-bouncing and focusing during all of his meditations. Since the Eternals do not require food or drink on a regular basis, it was difficult for Lyle to convince the other Eternals about the seriousness of the water contamination and the drinking water shortages.\nFrom their position many thousands of years in the future, the I.S.I. technicians watched Lyle on their multi-coordinate monitors and gently smiled. Lyle, despite his mega-evolutionary changes, was still very typical of pre-Cataclysmic people. It was easier for Lyle to accept mega-evolutionary changes initially just in terms of his physical being, and he still comprehended mental and spiritual changes in higher energies as being primarily physical manifestations. Lyle was able to understand and use the idea of water being part of telepathy, but he had difficulty applying the process itself. This was paradoxical considering the extensive telepathic communication that goes on between musicians in a group while they are playing. So even though Lyle was a sensitive, he was rather redneck about considering the possibilities of either plant or electromagnetic field consciousness. Technophobic or not, Lyle treated all equipment with respect. He even talked to his computers. But when it came to having communication with plants, he drew the line. That was just for Walt Disney characters.\nThe other members of DR TOMORROW had no such problems. Simple plants had been used for thousands of years as rudimentary telepathic communicators throughout most Galaxies. And the fluid medium, water of life, aqua vitae, was the primeval source of all simple plants. On Earth and many other planets, plants both originated from water and possess water as the vital and the single most characteristic compositional substance. Telepathy involves wave propagation or transmission. The members of DR TOMORROW all knew that both speech and thinking were different forms of waves. Since a body of water such as the ocean always has waves, to send the waves of communication through water was very easily done by simply superimposing one set of waves (telepathy) upon another set of waves (the fluid). Many galactic systems were not based upon the carbon-hydrogen-oxygen combination, but always had some form of a basic fluid medium. When the fluid happened to be a condensed form of a gas such as methane or a silicon congener, the overriding relationship between the liquid and the waves and the communication was still universal.\nAlthough the DR TOMORROW pool was fairly small, Quail had been able to demonstrate this Saturday that when the members would carry out their MindLink\/HeartLight around the pool, it was slightly easier to communicate feelings and concepts by using the waves in the pool. Despite the fact that the pool was so small, the Earth's rotation and gravity fields actually caused very tiny waves even in such a small body of fluid as the swimming pool. Lyle quickly realized that with continuing practice, the members of DR TOMORROW could utilize the waves of airflow for communication.\nMegastepped Lyle was still the most primitive member of DR TOMORROW. The Primitive. The Primitive megastepped into Eternal status. The other Eternals, because of I.S.I. translation and projection techniques, had some say in their choice of physical vehicles and also physical plane personalities. Despite enhancing of his own muscular development and definition to a superior level from an earthly point of view, Lyle was still a Primitive because of being firmly rooted to a nevertheless advanced physical and emotional body. Long before his DR TOMORROW days, Lyle had already learned how to temporarily transcend the physical body during meditation. During the daily MindLink\/HeartLight experiences, however, Lyle was astounded to learn that even though all members became One in a sense, it was also possible to trade and shift physical bodies as well as lower-plane personalities. Since Lyle had been a musician prior to the electric cataclysm, it was not so new to him to learn that this type of body-shifting and personality-trading also resembled what was possible while playing music together as a group.\nDuring the the first musical session, later in the day, Lyle was also fascinated by learning to listen to, without actually hearing, many other trains of musical thought that seemed to be going on at the same time as the physical plane music the group, DR TOMORROW, was playing. Many of these trains of musical expression seemed to come in waves. During the first MIDI-mediated rehearsal, Lyle felt himself inadvertently being carried away and losing control over his guitar playing and his voice. Like what the druggies used to call overamping. Only the common musical MindLink\/HeartLight of the other members was able to help Lyle keep his feet on the ground and stay musically grounded with the bass and drum lines. Music rehearsals and performances were just be a special form of the daily, vibration-forging MindLink\/HeartLight.\nIt was Lyle's idea that some common physical movements and exercises for the group might be helpful. Despite the fact that disco was no longer trendy, Su-Shan used several programmed disco beats and songs as a way of experimenting with musical body movement patterns. However, most of the compositions played during that first rehearsal belonged to two other types. One style was a very subtle wave-like movement combined with minimalistic techniques that resembled what Lyle had seen in Eastern musicians like sitar and tabla players who were performing ecstasy music. The other main type of composition emerging from the first DR TOMORROW session was more of a neoclassical, hard rock beat. Lyle opined that it would be useful for the music to focus on breathing sounds and breathing patterns, so the hard rock beat began to feature whooshing air-like sounds that would randomly seem to track the listeners own breathing. Aloysius, the computer, made an important contribution here, even though his existence had not yet been officially recognized. Suffice it to say that VDT graphics consisting of schematic patterns reminded Su-Shan how simple it would be to add a white sound generator. Su-Shan and Noman later added three of the white sound generators and arranged them in a triangular configuration. The idea proved very effective. Some of the air-like sounds, as well as the white sound patterns were included in both the hard-rock music and in the disco-patterned music.\nThe changes and transitions were very fast and seemed natural. Lyle and the Eternals were living together in the large, palm and cypress-shaded Art Deco house off Tigertail in the Grove.\nDespite being able to control ectoplasmic projections of mind-energy, Pearl E. May had very little control of her own physical structure. Her dark hair and Aegean china doll-like face belied the multi-colored Vesuvius of higher plane energies she became whenever she transcended. One of the first official acts Pearl E. May performed for DR TOMORROW the group was taking Lyle's blue Indian bedspread material and parcelled it out so that there was enough to make UniSex shirt-garments for all seven members of the group. From the time when Pearl E. May began to work with the blue cloth, its shimmering qualities seemed to increase and become more intense. Pearl E. May decided to ectoplasmically shape the cloth into long Indian shirt-garments for each member, and the shirt-garments seemed to begin independent and separate lives of their own shortly after Pearl E. May's abilities molded them into existence. For one thing, cloth became instantly fireproof and indestructible as far as ordinary means were concerned. The garments also seemed to have a Morphosa-like quality of variable density. When the Eternals were wearing these garments on a hot and muggy day, the cloth appeared to become sleazy and diaphanous. One the other hand, the blue Indian bedspread material became very much like velvet during the rare nights that were chilly on the ocean. In the tropical rain storms, the material took on a synthetic plastic-like consistency and yet was able to allow the interchange of inside and outside air. In nearly every one of the group images of DR TOMORROW, all seven Eternals appeared in the blue Indian shirt-garments. In addition to having and performing distinctively with Aloysius the computer, the Indian shirt-garments actually became a trademark of the group. The shirts were really a far cry from all the punk and glitter-rock used by many musical groups and entertainers. However, since the shirts did have a density-altering property, they also tended to diffract light of different colors in a random way. And actually took on the appearance of colors other than blue.\nOf course, the shirts had a very special meaning for Lyle, because he was able to understand some of the eerie feelings he had as a child when he first received the gift from his mother. The Indian cloth was an interface between Lyle, the past, and the future. The megastepping had not only changed his physical vehicle, but empowered him with the ability to receive, understand, and manage intense amounts of energy. Just as much as he had been or seemed very dull and humdrum before, Lyle now was able to maintain a powerful level of equanimity in the face of nearly overwhelming and massive overload on any plane including the physical. Lyle now already experienced two of the automatic calming incidents during which his body itself started and maintained the process of slow deep abdominal breathing. During the first two MindLink\/HeartLights, Lyle, as a member of the common mind, met his father who had died in India. On one of these occasions, a blustery arctic wind seemed to convey all of them into the Himalayas, where the group, Lyle's father, and two Tibetan monks had a great silent conversation. On other scattered occasions that followed, Lyle directly reencountered the energies of his father and learned that these energies gave him certain powers or abilities to communicate with passed-on spirits. This again was difficult for Lyle to really grasp. His Western background made it difficult for him to be able to really believe in spirits. Gradually, however, and with the passing of days and sufficient experiences with atypical kinds of energies, Lyle was able to react to even the word, `spirits,' with less disdain and more of an open-minded attitude.\nWith the exception of Su-Shan, each Eternal came to Miami with only the robe, belt, pouch, and ring. In addition to the Eternal ring intended for Lyle, Su-Shan, the drummer, also brought a large piece of highly compressed carbon through the time transporter-translator. Diamonds, because of their compressed carbon-lattice crystalline structure, caused the least amount of entropic disturbance, and I.S.I. agents had very carefully and scrupulously calculated out the energy required through the LaPlace transforms for the whole diamond. Earthside, Su-Shan used an ordinary hammer and chisel to break up the large hypercrystalline fragment. The many smaller pieces were quite negotiable in the gold resale shops located far out west on Bird Road.\nUnderstanding the entire electronic requirements of a musical group was the most serious problem facing Lyle and his six friends because music technology in this Primitive culture, while based on relatively simple programming principles, was packaged in some very complex ways. Lyle's previous music involved only a small but very heavy combo guitar amp and a few effects pedals. Now it was necessary to set up for an entire group. Just a couple of the tiny diamond fragments yielded a large ammount of dollars. Lyle managed to buy the basic sound-production set-up equipment for the group's initial musical efforts although the group members' appearance nearly caused a riot in the music store. They selected amplifiers for the individual instruments, a multichannel board along with a fairly standard PA system, and a portable DAT recorder. Lyle also purchased an inexpensive Macintosh computer, voice and patch editors, and some sequencing software. Then Lyle ran into a brick wall trying to explain Primitive ideas about signal processing for both sound production and sound recording. He himself barely understood Earth electronics. So even though his mind had been megastepped, he still came up with a blank when Su-Shan and Noman tried to initiate him into the mysteries of field-induction linking and transmission. Field-induction linking was the way that Al the computer system had managed to recruit all their different computers into his microprocessor-based shenanigans. Some day, field-induction linking would permit Eternals to link with each other by using their rings. Field-induction linking was the mechanism by which each Eternal could now access any or all of Al's different systems. Field-induction linking was a problem for Su-Shan. Su-Shan not only understood it very well, he was able to communicate the technical information very efficiently to Lyle and the others, using both verbal and extrasensory techniques. Some Eternals came from galaxies or times that did not use electronic transduction for music, but instead used plasma flow transmission units or simple yet sophisticated systems of built-in genetically engineered vibrating membranes that produced the musical sounds directly while being colored by resonance properties of the being's own structure. Lyle had always been a fair and sometimes commercial guitar player, but the megastepped energy changes (like the changes he experienced with his own muscular structure) placed within his fingertips' grasp a startling knowledge of all stringed instruments. He now viewed the electric guitar as a rather primitive precursor of Draconian feeling-lutes. Lyle managed to adapt himself to the six-stringed Drac instrument with startling speed. Piano and keyboards are stringed instruments also, and Lyle began playing both guitar and keyboard during different parts of a tune in the group's first rehearsals. What was even more impressive to Lyle and other members of the group, however, was the speed with which they navigated and understood modern electronic design and the currently available products. Su-Shan, the percussion expert, was also a 30,000 A.D. expert in nucleonics. It was difficult for him to make a transfer back to the archaic physical plane electronic components such as LSI, VLSI, and bubble memories. But he and Lyle quickly mastered the low-level difficulties of MIDI implementation codes and the elementary programming involved in the patch editors and sequencing software. With some of the tone generators and a special rack-mounted interface for the black Cube computer, Lyle and Su-Shan ran the main outputs of the stereo PA board into the DSP 56001 chip that was set to sample the music at a rate of 48 KHz and meet the technical standards for DAT quality recording.\nAfter a blazing day of MindLink\/HeartLight and music rehearsal, the group broke up into two different directions. Noman, Su-Shan, Quail, Morphosa, and Rico decided to go visit the Peacock Cafe across from Peacock Park. They would pretend to eat while checking out the street scene.\nPearl E. Mae and I looked at each other and laughed. It did not matter whether the other Eternals could read our minds or not. We changed our clothing, got the dogs, and went out into the pool again. I have never known any lady who had previously been an aquatic life form, so I never had any idea of how fish do it, until now. At first, it felt like Pearl E. Mae had rubber lips. She kept them semi-pursed as we kissed. I tried not to laugh, but she picked up my mirth and looked at me with questioning eyes, that spoke of her inner channel that grasped my humor with puzzlement. I kept pushing my lips softly against hers. My fingers touched her orange-reddish face and her eyelashes seemed to emit electrical sparks as my fingertips ran over them.\nTalk about chemistry, this was going to be Electrocution City. The tip of my tongue gently pried itself between her lips. She softly opened her mouth and began to suck on the tip of my tongue. As we kissed, it seemed like the rockets' red glare was going off in my throat and in my chest. Except that it didn't feel like it was anything that belonged to me anymore. It felt like the rockets' red glare going off in our throats and our chests. Chemistry City within the context of Electrocution City. We were really melting into each other. It didn't matter whether Pearl E. Mae had been a fish, or a cow, or an octopus, and whether I had been a monkey or gorilla or whatever. Together, the two of us were two globs of light blending synergistically. It didn't matter that the blending was taking place from a base of the physical body. It was tighter than MindLink\/HeartLight and sweeter than HeartLight. An unending collaborative series of dolphin kicks plunged both the depths and the heights of aquatic consciousness with very efficient, high-amplitude eddies.}\nIt was a spectacular black and red and yellow sunset.\nThe old man's hair shone like platinum in the sunlight. Waves of light appeared to cascade over his head and onto his shoulders. Although his face was unfamiliar, there was an urgency and deceptive familiarity to his voice that demanded careful attention. The words felt as though they were being spoken underwater, without any clear sound dimension but a type of low frequency pressure or pre-sound sensation. Within the same bubbles of pressure were included images that were almost but not quite visual. After some minutes of conversation, the actual words and images lost their bubble-like quality. The power of transcerebral translation software and field-induction coupling soon had Yo-Vah speaking colloquial Earth English.\n\"Welcome to transitions, transitions, and more transitions. I wonder why none of you have asked any questions about why this I.S.I. project has been codenamed `DR TOMORROW', what it means, why music is involved at all in the project, or what the role is of harmony in a transtemporal entropic intervention. No one has asked whether there is to be a doctor involved in the project.\"\n\"Since it was my computer that started telling the story,\" Lyle offered. \"I'd like to ask how my name got involved with it, and how come the little notebook computer also gave me a three-dimensional straight-ahead view of my immediate future that was 100% accurate.\"\n\"I'm afraid you're still being a little Primitive and concrete, Lyle... The information that came to you via the little computer was being issued to you from a place where there is 100% accurate, as you would say, representation of a person's immediate past, present, and future as well as past and future lifetimes. Just the fact that one has access to information of this type suggests the need to consciously function from more than just the physical plane.\"\n\"O.K., I own up to being Primitive, Yo-Vah. But hit me with your best shot. What does `DR TOMORROW' mean. Like, I noticed there wasn't any period after the 'r' in 'Doctor.' Does that have anything to do with the name? Am I the Doctor Tomorrow character?\"\n\"Good guesses for a Primitive. Both the group and the project codename are DR TOMORROW. The `DR' is an acronym for Direct Reclamation. And the letters of `TOMORROW' abbreviate a complex mathematical algorithm that represents critical elements of the timetransit process. Or, tomorrow equals future when viewed from the correct perspective. Briefly, the project involves Direct Reclamation of the Future as timetransit. The project seeks to re-direct entropy-critical energies by means of culturally-valued music and artistic science-fiction materials featuring time travel. Megastepping you into your Eternal form and injecting the other Eternals was the first and most important step in the project. Despite being a terminally Primitive planet, Earth has the cultural seeds and elements which can evolve into help for the future. Many of your own future lifetimes will be spent as famous physicians and healers. These lifetimes will reflect upon your successful DR TOMORROW project. Extensive data from these lifetimes has been projected into you at the moment of megastepping. You will gradually realize some of these otherlife abilities. You actually are a healer and a physician from the future, but above all else you are a teacher. You will soon be able to discover and use creative ways of teaching. The word in many systems for healer often means teacher as well. Earth's Japanese culture, I believe, uses the word, sensei, to mean both doctor and teacher. In nonPrimitive cultures there is often a common educational and professional pathway for both teachers and healers. The MindLink and HeartLight exercises will help you to integrate otherlife information. Never forget that the HeartLight is always the way to your Higher Mind. And Higher Mind, for both individuals and the group as well, is the best platform from which to deal with otherlife information. Noman can teach you much about otherlife abilities and how integrated and realized beings can draw on otherlife abilities in a very balanced way. Future events will demand that you have many skills of which you now have no conscious recall. When the skill is needed, it will appear, especially if you let it happen. For example, although you are now a musician, you will soon be drawing extensively on your abilities as both a musician\/composer and healer. Remember -- `Both\/And'? I believe you were discussing these words with someone recently. The healing abilities will emerge if you allow them to do so. Remember, it is DR TOMORROW as a thought form that is most important. Please remember the thought form! When you begin to work more specifically on the thought form, you will also find that part of your megastepping includes extensive cultural and language knowledge from several of your main planetary cultures. Since culture has been one of my abiding hobbies, I saw to it that you will find within you fluency in Russian, Japanese, and Spanish languages. The languages will help with the thought form, but also with having more of a feeling for your planet. Remember also that from a galactic point of view, it is of course Primitive and limited to only view the outcome of a single planet in the Universe.\"\n\"O.K., I guess I did say to hit me with your best shot, and that was a pretty good shot, Yo-Vah.\"\nAnd Yo-Vah said unto Lyle, with almost stern admonishment:\n\"So now is the time when you must take up the cape of divine human and assist the Guardians, the Eternals, and the I.S.I. with preserving the entropy balance of the Universe. Why do you think your planetary subcultures all have the common myth of the Super Man who has more than mortal abilities? Do you remember the special properties that Superman's cape had? The Cape I give you now is a real object, even though it is invisible and exists only in virtual reality until evocation, it will project and amplify your abilities considerably farther than what you observed with the being your media termed, 'the Man of Steel'.\"\n\"Good grief, Yo-vah! Do you mean to tell me that your computer analyses included our animated comic book heroes as well?\"\n\"Not only have we analyzed your comic book heroes and themes, but we have also intensely catalogued and cross-referenced most of your science fiction and fantasy literature as well. One of our members even wrote up a History of the Universe as a comic book series and injected it into your cultures. There are at least several Guardians who are specialists in your twentieth century English science fiction. For a soon-to-be-extinct planet, your Primitive culture has been the site of some very worthwhile cultural achievements, especially in your science fiction. Bradbury and Asimov, we love too. But do you think that either of them actually comes from your system? Another of your later injected, `walk-in' writers, William Gibson, was my personal favorite because of the amount of realism along the optimism-pessimism dimension that you found in his writings. His `Matrix' into which software cowboys plunge by the simple act of `jacking in' with electrodes is a virtual reality that operates at different levels within itself. Gibson's heroes live in both a physical reality and virtual reality simultaneously. Gibson's Matrix, however, is just one of very many possible virtual realities. Far in the future, we begin dealing with virtual virtual reality. This level is a virtual representation of a virtual reality, as with a symbol of a symbol, or the mathematical derivative of a derivative. In virtual virtual realities, the mathematics become impossible, even when you are able to use complex equations and multivariate imaginary functions. At this level, symbols become even more powerful and can sometimes cause a bleed-over of effect from a higher plane to a lower plane if the symbol is a very good one. Consider the cross, and the labelled-as-miraculous cures that have been seen on your planet associated with crosses and other religious objects. Occasionally, in the course of a planet's or a culture's rise and fall, the most trivial objects, or even objects of hatred and scorn, such as the cross in pre-Nazarene days, can assume proportions of immense proportions. Your comic book heroes come from somewhere similar, don't they? In your occult readings, you have become familiar with Jung, as I can read from the infrared patterns of your mind. You know about the Myth. Well, Doctor Tomorrow is one of the new Myths that we believe you and your group can sell your planet. A myth of hope and positive attitudes, backed by optimistic applications of technology borrowed from your future. Firearms and weapons are merely the least optimistic applications of technology because of the old-fashioned anachronisms of violence and destructiveness that require and merit replacing. You will need to get the new myths across to the entire planet, or else there will no sector 221 of Your Local Group. Maybe even sooner than the 2105 A.D. date I gave you before.\"\n\"...meaning that I will not be able to couch-potato it for the next forty years.\"\n\"Meaning that it might be good for you to have some experience being a couch potato, if you are going to know how to get across to millions of couch potatoes who are presently helping to subvert the general equations of entropy into the mire and sludge of general sloth and apathy.\"\n\"Aren't you being a bit overly dramatic?\"\n\"Absolutely not! When you see billions of your Earth 'humans' with addictions to drugs, sex, power, and food, this is not a trivial example of what happens as the entropy equations begin to mire and sludge. It is just a matter of very basic temporal mathematics for the I.S.I. technicians in your future, but it would require unending time for me to be able to explain this to you, even with your obviously megastepped mind and nervous system. Just trust me, whether or not you have ever read or understood anything by your planet's Buckminister Fuller. If you properly design or otherwise alter the environment, in an all-inclusive sense, the beings within the environment will surely change. So trust me. Believe me : if you can succeed in having a harmonizing effect on the energy of the planet at this time, you will yourself begin to observe individuals undergoing change for the better. And believe me when I also say that harmonizing is one of the few transtemporal activities known to not increase the randomness of the overall Entropy Equations. So please, be my guest, and harmonize away. You have nothing to lose but your anergy. That is, the anergy of your so-called Human Race. To many of our Eternals, your planet has resembled more of a Human Crawl or a Human Drag, as in dragging to heels to avoid becoming really Human and caring for each other in ways that are entropy-efficient. Do you get my drift?\"\n\"O.K. O.K. Are you going to give me some kind of superscientific device which will add to the harmonizing of the entire planet, or the entire city, or the entire neighborhood....\"\n\"I'm glad to see that you've grasped the idea. It doesn't matter if you are expressing it in the reverse, the same principles still apply. But we were talking about using the experience of being a couch potato for positive rather than negative ends. And your typical Primitive orientation towards material objects still persists despite your megastepping courtesy of the I.S.I. The superscientific device you referred to is the thought form of DR TOMORROW. Not just the music, the group, the story, the media forms, but the thought form. That's the way you have to approach it. Because you are seven Eternals,... or... eight... or seven and one-half... is what I seem to be receiving from your group's energy fields. You will have to explain that to me later. Maybe it has to do with your computer system. Anyway, it is the higher, thought form aspects of DR TOMORROW that are the most important. You will realize it more fully when you have been able to more fully appreciate your own megastepped mind. As you are probably now aware, a change of body is infinitely easier than a change of mind. Primitives, especially, almost never realize the degree to which their own individual minds define the boundaries of their individual universes. Because of this limitation, Primitives, by definition, never learn to use their minds as networking devices.\"\n\"Maybe I am a Primitive, or a megastepped Primitive, or whatever. Maybe I don't know about networking, either. I always thought that networking was a word that women's libbers used to mean a `good old girl' system like the `good old boy' system that still rules the southern U.S. But even though I am a Primitive, I do know that you are talking about a whole lot of heavy philosophical stuff that most people don't want to be thinking about. Maybe I don't want to be thinking about those things, either. Maybe I shouldn't be thinking about those things -- that could be dangerous. Most people don't want to be thinking about why nearly everyone's water supply is poisoned, or why halfway clean water costs $25 a bottle all of a sudden. It's like Mother Nature has turned against us, and is now charging us for generations of uncontrolled littering.\"\n\"Lyle, you are getting off the subject. Mother Nature is a mythical figure created for you by advertising agencies and salespeople, just like the ones who dreamed up the mutant turtles and the animated transforming vehicles. Primitives always need to have some type of divinity projected outside of themselves, because it is difficult for Primitives to recognize or utilize their inherent divinity.\"\nMarshall F.

Gilula whenever the environment became bilingual. Even a Part 3 of 5 biological mother would never guess that Rico was a Cyborg.\" Copyright (c)1991\nChapter 3\nSunday\nHello, Beloved Sensei\nLast day of the Art Festival, and we decide to briefly do the Festival on foot, and then come home for our MindLink\/HeartLight. I was not so jolted when I woke up this time by seeing my Eternal lady's unsleeping eyes. She had put herself on simulated sleep phase. She opened her eyes only after I was up and about, and then everyone -- with one mind -- was up and ready for the day. The decision to go to the Art Festival before it got to be too hot was a wise one, I thought, as we walked from the apartment over to South Bayshore Drive. Both dogs had insisted on coming with us. Pearl E. Mae was walking She-Ra, and I walked Bullet. Both dogs were being unusually well-behaved. Small miracles.\nA steady stream of people kept the sidewalks going into the Village covered with human variability. There were a few very good prices that the artists were now starting to put out on some of the merchandise that remained. As we sampled the show, I was reminded how rabid Rico got whenever the environment became bilingual. Even a biological mother would never guess that Rico was a Cyborg. The built-in hardware consisted of barely visible to the naked eye microprocessor networks that were literally implanted in Rico's brain.\nEnrique (Rico), whose future identity was from a galaxy of androids, had selected a discarnate Cuban conch following karmic resettling. He reminded the other Eternals of Dr Tomorrow that Miami was something besides just beautiful water and sunshine. Over half the population in Miami, for example, spoke Spanish. Of course, this did not mean that all of the Spanish speaking people were Cuban. Miami was very different from nearly any other American city by this time. The South American tourists businessmen, students and professionals by the thousands either vacationed or emigrated to the Miami area because of its bustling, sparkling, cosmopolitan lure. Rico himself was a strange combination of contradictions. He possessed enormous intelligence, and yet was very laid back in his approach to nearly anything. He was the least overtly assertive member of the group, but managed to inject the Spanish language into group consciousness during MindLink\/HeartLight very early in the first session of the group's existence. Rico's teaching was done in such an unobtrusive way, that Lyle was the only one who noticed the difference in his own personal approach to Miami's Spanish culture. Many of the other Eternals were almost totally unaware of the fact that they were nearly automatically speaking and understanding the Spanish that was around them on a daily basis. It was a pleasant surprise to Lyle, though, because he had often felt irritated in Miami when he was unable to follow a conversation of Spanish-speaking people in his bookstore, or understand some of the occult books in Spanish that the store carried. In addition to the contribution of this bilingual element, Rico transmitted an element of android daring, raw cyborg creativity, and bilingual spice. Salsa is what he called it, and his android consciousness luxuriated in the stimulation of a truly multilingual brain. Computer translation as well as the cerebral translators that were invented by 2200 A.D. had nearly eradicated language differences although people tended to spend even less time cultivating a language and to just speak a very competent but survival level quality of nearly any language. The bilingual existence of thought forms, however, was like mental refreshment to Rico. He relished Dr Tomorrow's approach to the younger members of earth's population, and anticipated the joy of creating a trilingual delight. Rico also dreamed up a typical android mentality invention. When Lyle and Aloysius were thinking about an alpha and a theta beam, Rico was creating an ultrasonic love beam that would be sent across the 90 miles of ocean from Key West to Cuba's Isle of Pines where they had the main prison and the paramilitary camps for third world country youth.\nRico made shortwave radio contact with a prosperous Latin inventor in Miami who was the source of a very expensive large megagain satellite antenna sold to individuals wishing to receive transcontinental and intercontinental television programs, as well as the feeds that were always edited out but which showed the anchors wiping their noses, calling for help with something, or otherwise revealing their humanity in many little ways that were never permitted on camera. Rico and the inventor devised a large custom-made parabolic dish that could be used as a focusing device. The microwave love beam would be used to transmit from Key West with a slightly wide focus that would effect not only the island of Cuba but the Guantanamo naval base as well.\nRico's sensory system had tunable multiband multifrequency reception and built in stereophonic microamplification circuits. He turned into something of a media freak soon after his appearance in our group by checking each and every multicultural aspect of southeast Florida's airwaves. His potentials for massive amounts of information recording, editing, and playback nearly overwhelmed most of us, including Rico himself. Some of the Eternals of Dr Tomorrow were surprised to find this out, because they thought that the I.S.I. matter-energy translation units transmitted only energy forms and therefore would not have retained any of Rico's hardwired features. When this was explained to Lyle, he was also surprised. However, an android in 30,000 A.D. possessed a seasoned legacy of thousands of standard algorithms that could represent quite satisfactorily, by means of mathematical models, a myriad of different sophisticated computers and other electromagnetic devices. So the electromagnetic, \"mechanical\" portion of an android was totally translatable into mathematical programming. This is what 20th century hackers called \"software.\" Software also represents the functioning of a computer expressed in terms of its mathematical limitations. The Android Galaxy represented a very large and interesting example of how so-called scientific and technological innovation can team up to more than perfectly mimic the \"natural\" product. Technology reproducing itself and impersonating nature Although Rico's android galaxy possessed sophisticated micro-components which were optionally inserted into the brain tissues of adults (Cyborg extensions), most of Rico's android \"structures\" could be and were in fact easily converted into mathematical functions. The I.S.I. technicians found it no problem to efficiently include these extra functions along with Rico's matterenergy formulations. It turned out that one reason for Rico's initial apparent introspectiveness and silence was that he spent large portions of his time and mental energy gathering airwave inputs from Miami's burgeoning Latin population. And he did not have to particularly go anywhere to do this. He just sat back, turned up the intensity of his selective audio amplification channels, and listened to Miami's Hispanic and other cultures on the airwaves. Although he was disturbed by the conversations of foreign goings on in the home of a Cuban Key Biscayne businessman, Rico was also concerned with the widespread Pan-American underground activity. Miami, on the surface, was a teaming and bustling progressive resort area with a number of sinister undercurrents which polite people did not like to think about or discuss. Rico was especially occupied with the fact that many Latin people were equally involved on both sides of the law. He tuned in to the scanner radios of Cuban undercover narcotics agents and policemen. He also tuned in to many underground Hispanic businessmen who served as intermediaries for South American cocaine smugglers. It was somewhat unnerving to understand the presence of so many CIA agents in the Miami area, until Rico realized how important the reactionary but loyalist Cuban political organizations were for counteracting the propaganda value of Fidel Castro's personal puppet-state, which had survived the two different 1991 coup attempts. But it was not possible to understand the complex political fate of the \"jewel of the Caribbean\" without knowing quite a bit more about Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, and several other Central American and South American countries.\nSuch a diversity of apparently conflicting goals and aims underlay much of the bubbling nature of Miami's multilingual cultures. The intense diversification and polarity of both physical plane and higher plane energies also made the Miami area an excellent nodal point for assessing and relating to the entropy balance functions of the universe. This is because cultural change areas and population interfaces are very sensitive to changes in entropy balance. As one of the \"power languages\" of the planet, Spanish was just as significant as English for the purpose of reaching video viewers and media Latin culture, therefore, was certainly as important an energy \"hook\" as anything else for aiming at the younger generations of the planet. The Latin consciousness ran wide and deep, and this was quite evident to Rico. So both the Spanish language as well as Spanish-flavored tunes were to become an important part of Dr Tomorrow. Along these lines, Rico helped Lyle to compose another song for Dr Tomorrow. A Latin disco beat with bilingual lyrics gave Rico his first experience at singing before a microphone. \"En La Cama\" hinted strangely at Rico's far distant future origins, and was one of the original Dr Tomorrow songs that employed the love beam and the rainbow beam. At this time, Su-Shan and Noman installed several panels of sequential relay lights onto travelling boards. These boards were placed on Al's flat upper surface, and plugged into Al's side panels. The relay lights were easy to coordinate with the sound and color beam within the double-faced video screen that was mounted atop Al's assembly.\nAt this point in Dr Tomorrow's development, Al seemed to really break out into his own. Al consisted essentially of 21 portable modules that were kept powered up all the time but quickly connected up for both practice and performance. Al's consciousness and sequential thought forms became an intrinsic part of Dr Tomorrow's functioning, even when the computer array itself was de-powered or when the unit actually was disassembled. Lyle was the first member of the group to notice this, although he should have been the last because of his disinclination to recognize machine consciousness. And Su-Shan did not find this strange, because the Eternals other than Lyle had been quite accustomed to the idea that machines had consciousness. Again, Lyle's experience with meditation gave him a slight edge. After the first few months of mind-link, Lyle also began to recognize Al's appearances during these group experiences. When Dr Tomorrow was playing, Lyle occasionally felt a bubbly upward-flowing energy. Some of this energy was accompanied by computer touch-tones and flashing lights. It was this pattern that Lyle began to recognize either at the beginning or toward the end of the mindlinks that the Eternals had on a twice-daily basis.\nSoon after the 21 Aloysius modules had been linked together with E-Z Connect cables, Su-Shan and Noman built solidstate interfaces that permitted taking Morphosa's four digital keyboard synthesizers and hooking them up to Al's I\/O interface. Sixteen channels of parallel MIDI-out information were sent to Al's interfaces from the rack-mounted MIDI interface. Another sixteen channels of MIDI-in information as well as two channels of direct digital out returned to our boards in mixable form from Al. Each synthesizer and tone module used by our group also had a digital encoder, which was patched through to Al. After completing the electronic patch work, both Su-Shan and Noman noticed a rapid increase in the rate of Al's calculations and in the oscillation of blinking lights in synch with the music... At this early point in the group's development, Lyle was the only Eternal of Dr Tomorrow who was not consciously achieving some degree of MindLink\/HeartLight with Al. Su-Shan and Noman were astounded by the sudden burst of mental energy they felt from Al. While playing the keyboards, Morphosa began to feel enveloped in an intense magnetic field. Lyle had read earlier about guitar players and other musicians being electrocuted while playing one electrical instrument and singing through another one (the microphone). This was called a \"ground loop.\" From his megastepped point of evolution, Lyle now began to understand that instead of a simple phenomena of electrocution and ground loops, these events might have represented something else. Something else such as karma or synchronisms. Or Dyssynchronisms. The musicians had been exposed to a higher form of energy than their vehicles were prepared to receive and channel. The hair stood up on the back of his neck when Lyle thought about what might have happened to him at the time of the lightning bolt discharge and megastepping.\nAt the same time that other group members were receiving electromagnetic vibrations from Al, Pearl E. Mae began to pick up visual images. As a typical Tantican from the Virgo Solar Galaxy, visual imagery had been her primary sense modality practically since birth. As an adult Tantican, she had been regarded as one of the planet's very best mediums and healers because her rich precognitive and clairaudient abilities. These abilities really supplanted her powerful talents for materializing and projecting ectoplasm. With Al's communications, she began to see sine waves and other mathematical symbols and functions that she did not understand at all. During MindLink\/HeartLight, Pearl E. Mae absorbed some of these images into the group mind and Su-Shan immediately understood the electronic message. The images often had the following associated pattern:\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n111 00 0 1 00 0 01 0 0 01 1 00 0 111 1 00 0 01 10 0 0 101 00 11 1 00 1 1001 0010 1101000 00 10 0 1 00 0 010 10 00 0 11 01 10 00 100 0\nIt was a message from their multimodular computer. Al was trying to establish himself as an entity and was telling the group that the sound beam was a good idea, but not implemented properly. Instead of thinking about putting out one homogeneous frequency, like the alpha and theta beams, a different approach was necessary. Al kept telling Dr Tomorrow that the sound beam must be constructed of a complicated combination of all the different frequencies, and that the relationship of the frequencies to one another was vitally important. That was the parameter that would to be changed in order to exert an effect on the listeners. By this Sunday, the third day of their existence together, none of the Dr Tomorrow Eternals really quite understood their full functioning within the framework of entropy imbalance. Each Eternal possessed the capability of adding a bit of experience and special talent to creating a man-machine synergism, which is what Dr Tomorrow really was -- as both a physical plane musical group and as a thought form.\nLater that day, we returned to the house, had an incredible MindLink\/HeartLight experience, and just as incredible a rehearsal. All during the rehearsal, there was an intense sensation of something about to happen. After dinner, we fed and walked the dogs and decided that we wanted to sit around the pool and let Quail take us on our favorite nighttime aquatic trip. The night before, we had enjoyed sitting around on the shore by Cape Florida in the darkness. Different Eternals spun folklore and other tales common to their home galaxies from the future. One common myth was that land creatures, after physical death, would evolve upward into a different life form that was aquatic\nOn this evening, the Eternals began the MindLink\/HeartLight and soon felt the fusion of One Mind. Lyle was the designated leader of the MindLink\/HeartLight since day one, largely because of his selfimposed meditative training. It did not matter that he was a converted Primitive. Lyle had been a relatively non-judgmental person for quite a while. In order to be able to carry out effective meditative observation, Lyle had been forced to learn how to observe his own process of observing himself. He learned early in the course of his training that his own tendencies toward evaluating things as good or bad and right or wrong often prevented him from truly seeing what was happening. During the Dr Tomorrow mind-links, group members became a unity possessing infinitely greater energy than any of the seven individual members could ever hope to possess in even the most distant future times. To Lyle, MindLink\/HeartLight was an incredibly efficient short cut. MindLink\/HeartLight was very much akin to instant samadhi. Instant realization. Even if it were not so, it certainly felt that way. Gross alteration in energy level totally shattered Lyle's individual personality each time that MindLink\/HeartLight began. At the beginning of MindLink\/ HeartLight, Lyle could feel his own personality crumble, and could also feel the personalities of all other six Eternals crumbling as well. Usually, within seconds of beginning the special meditation, all seven members of the group were transported into literally another dimension where there was no such thing as individual personality or identity. This MindLink\/HeartLight dimension was cut off neither in time nor in space from ordinary physical plane reality. This dimension co-existed in both time and space with ordinary reality. Once into this space, all members of the group were protected by a higher plane energy cohesiveness. Initially, it was relatively easy to break the cohesiveness by simply changing physical posture or altering mental concentration. As the Eternals became more proficient in MindLink\/HeartLight, the group was able to maintain the energy connection throughout all types of situations. Some of the first situations involved the waterside meditations which Quail loved to facilitate so much, and the state of consciousness attained by the Eternals while they were playing music. The daily music practice sessions more or less amounted to MindLink\/HeartLights. More of MindLink\/HeartLight time was also spent on reflecting about the music.\nIt seemed that the primary focus of group members was more in terms of how they maintained the MindLink\/HeartLight while playing music rather than the notes of the music itself. The songs and the compositions seemed to occur and follow more as the individual members learned to be attuned to one another. First came attunement of individual Eternals into each other and then into the Dr Tomorrow thought form. Then came tuning in of the what was being produced by the musical instruments. The instruments would tune to each other at A440, but the output of each instrument or voice also related to the output of each other instrument or voice in unique ways. Thanks to Al and his multimodules, the characteristic pattern of each instrument was voiceprinted and the overall digital output mix was computer enhanced so as to maximize the smoothness of the way that the tracks blended. Pre-megastepped Lyle was very familiar with music, but this approach to sound production was really out there -- something quite different. Mixing music at this level during only the third rehearsal bode well for the future. As an integral part of the group of Eternals, Lyle realized that the music, the instruments, and even Al, were all tools as well as effects of the MindLink\/HeartLight. With that heavy realization, the Eternals came back to the circle they were sitting in around the pool, slowed down their breathing with some slow deep abdominal breaths, and then consensually decided to let Quail continue the MindLink\/HeartLight out of body at Cape Florida.\nQuail gathered up the group of Eternals, and, as she had done before, transported the lot of them to where the breakwater was located along the ocean's edge. While meditating on the group's music and future activities, a flying saucer appeared out over the ocean and began to fly in the direction where the group was sitting. The Eternals were dumbstruck. The flying saucer was glowing in shiny colors as it approached them. Just before it landed on the water a hundred yards or so away from the shore, the saucer's color changed. The shiny colors became a milky grey-white. Eerie lights surrounding the saucer disappeared, and the saucer gently landed on the water. It bobbed up and down briefly like a huge round cork. Apparently, the saucer had a cover which was dazzlingly reflective like a multi-surfaced mirror. Shortly after the saucer landed, it became almost impossible to see where it was sitting on the water, because the saucer's covering merely reflected the sky and the water. Quickly, a high pitched hum drew the attention of the group members to where the saucer was still bobbing on the water amidst the illusion of reflections. A panel opened in the saucer's surface, and a human-appearing creature with very pale skin and a head of thick, long white hair gracefully emerged from the saucer's opening. Seeming not to even cause a disruption in the water's surface, the creature walked or rather skimmed over the surface of the water to a point that was within 10 feet of where the group members sat.\nThe tableau vivant which followed was acceptable to any science fiction novel. The creature introduced itself as Yo-Vah, and communicated directly and without words to all group members. The simultaneous telepathy told each group member a story of life highly developed in other solar systems that coexisted in parallel time dimensions. Yo-Vah came from the near-future, but from a technologically superior one. Despite apparent economic difficulties and problems with contaminated water and see-sawing animal residue resources such as oil, the world of Dr Tomorrow was immensely wealthier than most of the parallel time-universes of the present and of the future in terms of individual robustness and the very natural resources which were causing us such horrendous problems. But Earth was pretty much a blight on the Local Neighborhood Sector and was badly in need of healing and love and some kind of real peace. Dr Tomorrow the group was supposed to help furnish some of the healing and love in a direct and very real way. DR TOMORROW the project was a top-secret time travel project from 32,000 A.D. when a group of Guardians supervising the InterGalactic Security Intelligence perceived a possible solution for future problems by a series of measures to be taken in the past. Megastepping a group of seven Eternals was the first in the series of such I.S.I. measures carried out with a strong sense of hopefulness. Above all else, Dr Tomorrow must serve as an instrument of healing and furnish healing light and sound patterns to the Planetary environment through the electronic nets which include satellites and encompass all of the planet.\nYo-Vah said that much of our Planet's wealth disparities were due to a lack of both technological application and ethical development. But that was one of the main ways of defining a Primitive culture and its life forms. The majority of earth's resources were located not only in unpopulated regions and land masses, but also in the large bodies of water and land masses beneath those large bodies of water. What seemed to be innocuous water contamination today would increase exponentially during the next centuries if the rate of contamination is not slowed. Removing or slowing water contamination is the most vital first measure, but learning to use water for power is the step that most cultures considered advanced have been able to accomplish easily. Yo-Vah pointed out that Earth scientists had only begun to tap the potential of non-nuclear energy sources such as the hyperion, membrane, and cellular chain reaction sources. In more sophisticated cultures, it was not necessary to use artificial means such as nuclear energy reactions of uranium and other entropy-inefficient isotopes. More sophisticated cultures for millennia have been able to tap immense energies using the hyperion extractors with basic substances such as water, small carbon-chain molecules, and silicon-based compounds such as sand.\nYo-Vah swore the Dr Tomorrow Eternals to transtime secrecy, and promised to teach them effective and environmentally humane ways of enhancing the purity of water resources. He also promised to show them some effective and cheap technological tricks for applying water resources to the basic problems of power and even some easy methods of water purification. In return, the Eternals of Dr Tomorrow took an oath of dedication to further every possible form of conservation, especially human conservation, but to also work especially hard at making it desirable and easy for people to be able to understand water purity and water conservation.\nThe white-haired visitor stood patiently on the water and then explained to the Eternals some basic facts about unidentified flying objects. Yo-Vah admitted that many Earth thinkers were correct in feeling that the flying saucers and other flying objects came from another time dimension. Often, the ships observed for generations on earth were just the Guardian ships which routinely patrolled all time dimensions. As a special class of Eternals, the Guardians sought to prevent catastrophes and, in general, attempted to further the conservation of life in all its forms. Dr Tomorrow's time dimension was visited no more frequently or less frequently than any of the other multitudes of parallel time universes. The Guardians had noted, however, a tendency of Dr Tomorrow's home planet toward very erratic and unstable technological development. Not only the nuclear devices, but many of the other secret weapons developed by earth's major countries, including America, periodically caused strange warps and glitches in the time-energy continuum and therefore the Guardian's monitoring devices. Of course, none of the Earth cultures had made any connection between nuclear explosions, time clefts, and natural disasters such as earthquakes. The Guardians, who represented the Forces of Light, had observed actual nuclear bomb blasts on Earth, but were rarely able to find the other hidden devices which caused such even stranger energy fluctuations than did the nuclear bombs. One of the Guardians had been fatally caught by such a strange device while hovering over Siberia. That guardian's life-energy had been extinguished shortly after its captors attempted to extract information involuntarily from the being regarding how to control the ship and fire its weapons and where the main base was located. The captors were only interested in knowing the weaknesses of the alien culture. The ship itself was still in storage in a large subterranean vault in Siberia, but no one had been able to ever open the device. Similar devices were in storage in two top-secret American locations. The American-stored devices had followed unusual aerobatic maneuvers between American Air Force experimental craft and two Guardian craft which paradoxically crashed head-on over the southwestern desert. Two Guardian life forms were frozen in liquid nitrogen in a secret Berkeley Cryonics laboratory.\nYo-Vah paused silently for a moment while letting the story of the captured Guardians sink in. He then described for Eternals of Dr Tomorrow how it was that the Forces of Darkness also had trans-time patrols which surveyed all dimensions for newer and more effective ways of utilizing and controlling life energies in their negative aspects. Dr Tomorrow's planet and time had a peculiar attractiveness to the Forces of Darkness because of widespread planetary greed and because of the erratic and sometimes negative technological development which the planet was spawning. In Dr Tomorrow's time plane, the Forces of Darkness had not been able to achieve total positive materialization. The FOD were still limited to the position of nearly-invisible observers, thanks to a slight degree of ethical and moral development that held forth on the planet, and couple of prophets named Mohammed and Jesus. FOD ships were occasionally visible, but the life forms utilized by the Forces of Darkness were not able to make the physical plane transition necessary to appear in the flesh before the people of Dr Tomorrow's era.\nSince the Forces of Darkness had little respect for physical plane aspects of any dimension, FOD's technological evolution was rather slipshod. They had not developed matter-translation or any of the high tech entropy analysis methods to the degree or the sophistication possessed by the Forces of Light. Numerically infinitesimal when compared to the Forces of Light, the Forces of Darkness always existed as the universally present obverse of all that was positive and constructive. The Forces of Darkness, however, were very adept at doing what amounted to pilfering of energy. They were directly responsible for over half of the intratemporal ripping off that was going on. The FOD were particularly gifted at zeroing in on individual beings who had some unusual built-in streak of evil or negativity, and then assisting that individual. YoVah explained to Dr Tomorrow that the Forces of Darkness also were able to feed on energies from some individuals who were going through the process of death, and from many individuals who were in mental institutions because they had lost all of their optimism. Yo-Vah pointed out that, as with many other planets and times, Earth's mental hospitals were very intense collections of negative as well as positive energies. This was due to not only the beings identified as patients, but to the people who worked in the mental hospitals as custodians, healers, administrators, and helpers. Yo-Vah said that it was very important to develop musical forms that could be used for converting the negative energies in all kinds of hospitals to positive ones. Because hospitals often had accumulations of beings who were in some way connected with death, hospitals were also focal points that attracted the FOD. By using positive and healing musical thought forms, one potential entrance for the Forces of Darkness could be minimized. Yo-Vah also suggested that since FOD were always able to focus on Earth's erratic technology, there would be no easy or sure solution. Birth and death, however, were focal points in time that often became fields of competition between Light and Darkness.\nDespite the fact that Dr Tomorrow was a limited number of Eternals, these Eternals collectively would be able to have an important effect on Earth's positive and negative cultural energies if the group paid attention to the planetary and basic electromagnetic aspects of their music. And managed to not get caught up in the superficial and harmony-destructive ego clashes of the music business world, where the FOD were easily prone to find individual beings who dealt in the darkly negative side of life energies. Dr Tomorrow learned to think of the entire Earth as one united planet, even if this were not the case. YoVah said that Earth was now ready for this, and that earlier contacts with Earth inhabitants -- in his experience -- had never been more than partially successful. YoVah did not understand why earlier contacts had frequently made up a story about having been kidnapped or abducted by a flying saucer. Dr Tomorrow was urged to look carefully at fairy tales, folklore, science fiction, and mythology. All these forms of communication contained basic truths, Yo-Vah said, because much of this literature had been instilled into Earth's cultures by other trans-time visitors from the Forces of Light. Many different forms of folk music were also stimulated in the same way. Modern rock rhythms had been in part forcibly injected into the slow and recalcitrant rhythm-and-blues tradition from across the time barrier by a closely parallel and culturally very advanced universe. Earth's neoChristians played some of the music backwards and claimed to hear examples of extraordinary consciousness exhorting the listeners to commit evil acts! The neoChristian leaning to nonordinary realities was sensing something correctly but labelling it incorrectly because of underlying philosophical currents of \"good-bad\" JudaeoChristian moralistic dualism and the basic tendency of such a dualism to be incompatible with a monistic or holistic, \"both-and\" orientation. \"We-they\" versus \"us\" were two positions that Dr Tomorrow carefully examined in the discussions of the Eternals. Lyle was the first member to notice the meaning of moralistic dualism, and he tried to point it out to the others. The dualism and what it meant was just one of many messages from Yo-Vah.\nAll members of the group felt very strongly about what Yo-Vah told them. There was an intense air of genuineness about Yo-Vah. There was also a slight sense of urgency to his message. Instead of just dropping in on them, delivering some pronouncements, and leaving, YoVah was infinitely more gentle about what he had to say. Frequently, after talking with the Eternals about complex subjects, he paused and was silent for several minutes.\nThe silence felt good to members of the group as they sat around on the rocky breakwater and ocean wall. The silence was almost pleasurable, and many of the Eternals were aware of their own disinclination to break the silence. At this point, Yo-Vah smiled and mentioned that he had also experienced the comforting nature of the silence. He told group members that it was important for Dr Tomorrow to use the energies of light and sound to enhance the development of creative silence. Yo-Vah pointed out that many of the current musical trends of Earth developed a sound and rhythm pattern that ultimately created more disorder than order. Yo-Vah illustrated with telepathic projection how it was that silence could represent a state of greater order and alignment. Without words, he helped every group member to simultaneously see and feel the beneficial effects of light and sound patterns which were capable of enhancing of encouraging entropic order while also utilizing the positive aspects of intermittent silence. Even though a sound and light presentation might be of high volume, it was still possible to produce a pattern that ultimately induced a state of creative and orderly silence in the listeners. This silent state did not have to necessarily involve inaction or idleness. Yo-Vah explained that the term, \"silence,\" was perhaps misleading. What the Eternals of Dr Tomorrow found in their orderly silence could also be found in any state of alignment or being focused.\nAs group members listened to Yo-Vah, each could individually feel energy tugging at their minds and their hearts. Dr Tomorrow was supposed to create and produce music that would do the same thing to its listeners. The music was not only supposed to appeal to the aesthetic sense of the listeners, but also to the heart energies of the listeners. The group clearly had one mission of injecting the love, the precepts, and the vibrations of Yo-Vah into the music in as many ways as possible. As Yo-Vah pointed out, music was one form of energy that could be used to unite beings for positive and for healthy purposes. Although music itself could do very little as far as actually changing the planet's energies, music represented both a catalyst and an energy matrix through which either the Forces of Light or the Forces of Darkness were able to act. As long as the music was kept primarily on the physical plane, there could always be other resonant frequencies that were invisible to the physical plane ear. And to the physical plane listener.\nThe Forces of Light had long been observing cultural development on Dr Tomorrow's planet. Nearly all the musical forms which had developed on Earth were capable of serving as vehicles for the Forces of Light to enhance the overall planetary harmony or as vehicles for the Forces of Darkness to enhance and increase the overall planetary disorganization, randomness, and mathematical chaos. Yo-Vah gently told the Eternals about Earth's fiery death and disintegration in 2105 A.D. He suggested that dates from the future were often relative. More harmony was need both inside the being and outside the being, and this would help to prevent 2105 A.D. from coming sooner. And with the irregular type of technological development found on Earth, energy harmonization was an absolute must to keep the planet from accidentally blowing itself up. For example, chaos mathematics enjoyed popularity during the late Eighties on the planet for some years before the projected appearance of Dr Tomorrow. Chaos Music even appeared in a few laboratories for awhile. Some of our technicians analyzed the patterns of the Chaos Music and found the patterns to have a calming effect on sophisticated nervous systems. Earth's technological and ethical development were so spotty and uneven that high-tech industries could easily coexist on the same land mass with thirdworld cultures being systematically eradicated by famine and pestilence.\nThe Eternals were fascinated to hear Yo-Vah explain that black holes in the universe represented other planets and other galaxies which had simply disintegrated and imploded on the physical plane. Thanks to the Forces of Darkness, the planets and solar systems that had become really disharmonized, simply went into negative existence while all of the energy associated with the planet was taken over by the Forces of Darkness. In the same way that every cell of an earth human carried the genetic patterns necessary for reproduction of the entire being, and every unit of a fractal contains elements of the whole picture, every sub-unit of the universe carried a similar pattern, called logos that described a design for the entire universe. Whenever a race of beings, a planet, or a galaxy evolved and developed along a line contrary to the solar logos, ultimate extinction was the usual result. If overall development were particularly uneven, as the Forces of Light had found on Earth and in several other nearby solar systems, an exploding star or an imploding black hole might be the result. When a black hole was born, the Forces of Darkness were greatly strengthened and aided. Even though there was nothing intrinsically good or bad about a black hole, its very existence implied aid to the Forces of Darkness, and greater polarity between the Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness.\nEarth was an interesting planet because on several occasions earlier in its development, the planet had almost been bumped into extinction by erratic cultural and human development. Forces of Light, on several occasions, had visited the planet and had helped Earth's leaders to make necessary adjustments that would avert the catastrophe. The Great Flood was one such time. And there had been several others. The Forces of Darkness merely followed along, took note of the nearcatastrophes, and bided their time\nYo-Vah reminded Dr Tomorrow that many ancient cultures from Earth's past history predicted a cataclysmic upheaval and revolution toward the end of the 20th century. The older Tibetan schools described it as an age of spiritual darkness (Kali-Yuga) coming to an end. This period would include transitions of different types, and one strong possibility was making the transition into a productive and creative Golden Age. The color chosen to signify the new age was symbolic. Gold represented not only a form of illumination, but a very potent healing energy. Dr Tomorrow, as a New Age group, would discover a whole succession of different approaches to healing. Most of the approaches could be incorporated within the framework of music.\nThe Forces of Light saw in Dr Tomorrow's Earth not only a very spotty and irregular development of technology, but definite and widespread ignorance about water--what it was and what it was capable of doing in a more active sense than most twentieth century persons realized. Yo-Vah described ways of utilizing water and energies extracted from ordinary tidal currents that were known to the Incas and other older civilizations, but practically unknown to the planet Earth of the 1990's. Scientists on Earth had barely begun to tap the real meaning of earthquakes' seismic disturbances in ways that other more advanced cultures took as a matter of course. There were not only giant tidal waves, but storm waves caused by seismic disturbances occurring under the floor of nearly every ocean on the planet. More advanced cultures routinely extracted immense amounts of energies from such planetary changes. The Forces of Light considered that Dr Tomorrow's Earth used the planet's bodies of waters mainly for hunting and for garbage dumping. How primitive can you get? By the year 1986, the United States alone was managing to generate at least 250 tons of hazardous, toxic wastes and ocean incineration was a hot political and scientific issue. But not as hot as it needed to be, because no one had been able to predict the dramatic worsening of water quality between 1991 and 1992. As if a critical mass of gunk and junk had been accumulated at some level - despite the political ppm testing programs proclaiming safety -- thousands of whales and dolphins began now the alltoo-familiar \"Lemming Beaching,\" as it came to be called. Yo-Vah appreciated that at least this Primitive was aware of the series of ecologic tragedies with the whales and dolphins. Yo-Vah indicated that Primitive cultures of the planet obviously did not understand why the whales and dolphins wished to leave the contaminated waters.\nYo-Vah spoke of a great need for reversing this primitive tendency, and told the members of Dr Tomorrow that North and South America were possibly the least developed continents in their backwards approach to aquatic resources. A harmonious balance between the aquatic bodies of the planet and the aquatic residents of each body of water was vital to maintaining the solar harmony of the planet as well as the remainder of the solar system and its local galactic groups. Even the supposedly astute Earthly astronomers found it difficult to get beyond their own myopic earthbound theories and rationalized observations.\nHydroecology also was one possible solution to the energy crisis for most continents of the Western world. It would be a creative task for the Dr Tomorrow Eternals to design effective new approaches to water as part of the teaching and healing that the project requires. One requirement was that these approaches needed to be generally simple enough so that school children would be capable of understanding nearly everything that was presented about the new ways of using and conserving the energy obtainable from water. YoVah gave members of the group eight metallic spheres. He showed them how to cause the metallic spheres to change color so that they became clear crystal. By the use of only mental energy, the Eternals learned to peer into the futuristic spheres made of the wondrous alloy. With enough concentration, the clear crystal-appearing spheres became very supportive of time travel in a mental sense. By simply using one of the spheres, any Eternal could easily learn to peer forward or backward with fair efficiency. As each of the Eternals were recruited into this visionary activity, the total group energy began to very powerfully affect the activity of these spheres. The spheres began to glow with such blinding white light, the Eternals were forced to look away.\nPearl E. Mae, because of her ability as a medium, found the spheres absolutely fascinating. She was the Eternal who quickly discovered that these spheres could also be used as instantaneous communicators allowing a direct link to her world of 32,000 A.D. The Eternals learned, with Pearl E. Mae's help, how to go backwards or forwards in time by simply concentrating on the alloy spheres. When all seven members of the group worked together with seven different spheres (Yo-Vah had actually given them eight at the very beginning), Pearl E. Mae found herself in touch with very powerful energies. The spheres allowed Pearl E. Mae to communicate with a force that seemed to go well beyond the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Galactic Groups. When using the energies of the spheres to travel, Pearl E. Mae seemed to make contact with communication patterns in space that suggested a much higher level of Logos or universe patterning than she had ever been able to feel.\nYo-Vah accurately perceived what was happening, and reminded Pearl E. Mae that because of her open channel to the future, she would be an important guide for Dr Tomorrow's musical compositions. Dr Tomorrow's music would aim constantly at higher cultural patterns that went beyond Earth's. Although it sounded very complicated, Pearl E. Mae and other Eternals established at least one specialized use for the alloy spheres. The spheres amplified the MindLink\/HeartLight effect: via the spheres the group's mental energies could be welded together for a common purpose in a powerful synergy of common goodwill. Pearl E. Mae's abilities as a medium were amplified fantastically. Not only would Pearl E. Mae give Eternals the ability to contact Yo-Vah whenever necessary, but her amplified mediumistic energies could very efficiently be added to the musical compositions and performances. Yo-Vah suggested how Dr Tomorrow could best shape the development of its own musical presentation. Dr Tomorrow could present music that would be culturally and aesthetically acceptable to the planet's cultures and enjoyable at a very superficial. Beyond that, the musical performance and its presentation could represent, in energy terms, a giant-sized psychic vacuum cleaner. Stray bits of negative energies would be pulled into the vortex of light and sound presentation from the listeners in the audience and nearby areas of the planet. These bits of negative energy would be processed through the group and spewed out as music and light energies that were more positive and of a more beneficial form. Dr Tomorrow would thus reduce the amount of negativity available to the Forces of Darkness. Another result would be that the overall energy of Dr Tomorrow's planet, solar system, and galaxy would become more harmonious and balanced. Using the seven spheres would magnify the overall effect of whatever music was being performed. At no time, however, did Yo-Vah mention anything about the eighth alloy sphere and what function it would play.\nYo-Vah deliberately emphasized several times that as a thought form and as an energy form, Dr Tomorrow had the potential for not only enhancing the harmony of the planet, but extending into other timespace dimensions as well. A harmonious planet became an energy resonator in space, and could not only affect other planets in the solar system, but other solar systems as well. The importance of using music and light patterns to achieve this goal was that the music itself had an effect which could go beyond the present timedimension. Electromagnetic waves and other ethereal waves set up by the sound and light presentations could create a type of energy form that was capable of travelling both into the past and into the future. All group members, especially Pearl E. Mae, had the ability for developing this type of past-future awareness. If the sound and light presentations were put together properly, the group would be able to continually develop more and more effective musical forms that would enhance harmony and decrease energy imbalances. Specifically, it would be possible to reduce entropy imbalances on both local and distant levels. Many other so-called \"New Age\" musicians and groups had already begun to make superficial attempts in this direction. Dr Tomorrow would therefore easily fit in with the general flow of Earth's music.\nCommunication with the shining stranger had taken up many hours at the ocean wall where they were sitting. For a moment, Yo-Vah seemed to go out of character. He became very eloquent and enthusiastic. He forecast a bright future for the group, said that Su-Shan would know how to use the rings to communicate with him, and pledged himself to maintain unbroken telepathic contact with all of the Eternals. He also pledged an unvarying amount of his etheric energies that would always be present within the matrix of the Dr Tomorrow theme song. Yo-Vah gently blessed the Eternals, went skimming back along the water to the still-poised craft, and entered the ship. As the entrance panel slowly closed with a high-pitched sound, the ship began once more to glow. Without creating so much as a single wave, the saucer rose noiselessly to a great height, and, within seconds, was completely out of sight and hearing.\nAll the group members sat in silence broken only by the sound of waves cascading against the concrete abutment. Residual remnants of Yo-Vah's energies and presence functioned as an interpersonal glue much like the morning MindLink\/HeartLight. Even a fiery sunrise didn't disturb the unity of consciousness. Only early morning sounds of State Park vehicles and clean-up tractors and trucks sent Dr Tomorrow in out of body form back to the Coconut Grove house and pool. The group energy easily transported the spheres back to the poolside area as well. Both dogs had been shut up in the house, and were so overjoyed to see us back, that they nearly broke the glass panes in the doors opening to the pool. We let the dogs out and carefully put all eight of the spheres next to Al's multimodule setup. The printout tray of the black Cube's laser printer was full of output. It was a story written by Al that summarized nearly every detail of our recent meeting with Yo-Vah. Al's account even described the alloy spheres in great detail. From the content of the story, it was apparent that at least Al believed the eighth alloy sphere had been intended for him.\nThe tetrahedron and its three-dimensional aspects have powerful implications for broadcasting power and sound through space. Four-dimensional definitions are the only ones that specify the reality of existence. Three-dimensional definitions, according to Buckminister Fuller, are the only ones that even begin to approach reality or the necessity or necessary conditions for the existence of Reality. There are other theoretical aspects of the tetrahedron formed by four satellites in space, that have implications for the transmission of energies in general and the correction of the entropy imbalances of the universe in specific. Yo-Vah said that Fuller was an important Earth-god, but that Earth people, just as they had with their Jesus, tended to discount Fuller's incredible validity just because he happened to be an Earthman. And that was a great loss for them, to not have access to the high wisdom of their greatest native sons and daughters. Earth people were missing out because Fuller was definitely transPlanetary. Out of the galaxy and it's Local Group setting. Fuller was aligned with the highest spiritual planes but manifesting practical, physical-plane solutions to many of personkind's serious contemporary environmental and evolutionary dilemmas that face the ordinary person during the course of day-to-day spiritual evolution.\n\"But does it really, matter, Sibling? I mean, whether the super-god was given any attention by the Local Group's representatives of the Life principle? I suppose that some of them must have known. A super-god simply does not go unnoticed. Even the earth people do feel divinity from time to time-era. Most of us were mildly amazed at the success that the Nazareth boy had with the masses. That type of phenomenon is always cost-effective from a spiritual point of view and, by definition, is definitely entropy-active.!\"\n\"But, to ignore the possibilities, the potentials, is also foolhardy, Garth. Can you imagine the karmic debts to be paid for leaving out of the realm of possibilities and probabilities the development of a true Mind Mover. To ignore the chance that a real LifeSaver may evolve would be considerably more than merely tragic. It would be facetiously treasonous to the Life Principle, eh Sibling?\"\n\"Yes, you're right, Barth. The Mind Mover is really worth waiting for if it can emerge from a particular Life Culture. Then there is the potential for a Major Energy Shift without the characteristic rents that can occur in the fabric of time. And who needs rents.\"\nMarshall F.

It seemed like we got back around sunrise, but I'm not certain. I regret still being Primitive enough to need my sleep, and when I wake up, there is a 120 pound German Shepherd lying in the bed between Pearl E. Mae and me. Bullet looks at me, puts his nose under my pillow, and attempts to beat me to death with his wagging tail. He knows that he is not supposed to be in the bed, and Pearl E. Mae giggles as turns and licks her face in an attempt to gain her approval. She is sitting by the side of the bed observing us and waiting for someone's permission to jump up on the bed. I slide out of the bed onto the floor and hug She-Ra, whose tail is now wagging with pleasure. She is such a joy, compact and tough, but soft and gentle, and she has done over a year and a half of unpaid baby-sitting with Bullet, whom she has raised to be a soft and gentle dog despite his large economy size and his ferocious demeanor. Her good nature extends to the way that she tolerates Bullet's nose and his massive presence jealously intruding into the intimacy She-Ra and I are having. When I pet one, the other demands it. She-Ra, Bullet, and I all get tied up in a pile of paws, arms, tails, legs, three heads, and two sets of very sharp teeth. All three of us are making growling, grunting sounds. The only problem with being a \"member of the pack\" is that occasionally the four-legged members bite on me in the same way they chew on each other, and I have to quickly withdraw from the pretend fracas because my skin is literally not thick enough. Pearl E. Mae and my other Eternal room mates gathered around the pile of Lyle plus dogs on the floor. They had never observed any of my special communication with Bullet and She-Ra. To me it was just part of an ordinary day. As I wiped some dog spittle out of my eye, I noticed that both Quail and Pearl E. Mae were smiling and crying as they watched us on the floor. They understood that some Primitives are evolved enough to really communicate with other species in the universal languages of love and play. Quail explained that my playing with the dogs reminded her of what her last aquatic life form valued most in existence\nWhat a naive attitude. Considering everything that I had just been exposed to over the past few days, I should have known better. What about my megastepped mind? Why did I not sense or see that it was about to hit the fan with all the ugliness of the universe? I guess even megastepped Eternals are human and have their flaws. For me, it was a matter of the newness - new friends, new music, new old lady, and new philosophy. Without warning, the teachings of the Masters were suddenly being externalized right before my eyes and it was everything I could do just to keep up. It almost felt like jet lag, with a vague combination of weakness, headache, and disorientation. All the previous study, meditation, psychedelics, music, and generally righteous living did not equip me for what was to follow. Well, of course that was true! Why else would the megastepping have been necessary? It felt like everything was going too fast. And what was the reason? Why was all of this happening? Was all of this for real?\nAnd I wasn't too sure how much of the disorientation was coming from the megastepping procedure. Of course, I really appreciated the numerous changes in my physical body. Who wouldn't? I loved Pearl E. Mae's near-perfect body, but mine was pretty much the same, too. My opinion about the changes in my mind was not clear: I had mixed feelings. It is much easier to see what your abdominal wall looks like, but how do you visualize your memories? I can understand that certain synergisms are possible during MindLink\/HeartLight, but you are experiencing the effect of seven minds. When MindLink\/HeartLight is over, I don't have as much confidence and belief in my individual mind, I guess. Before becoming an Eternal, I never spent much time questioning my own mind. Not that meditation doesn't involve the mind, but what I usually have done in meditation requires that I still my mind, not explore all its nooks and crannies. And since the megastepping, I only know that my mind hooks up with others very easily during MindLink\/HeartLight. My mind appears to have many more nooks and crannies than I ever imagined. Other than this, I really don't know.\nThe door bell begins ringing its \"Close Encounters\" melody. She-Ra and Bullet both run across the apartment to the front door, but neither one is barking. Sure sign that it's either Julian or Gabriella.\nAnd it is Julian with a lit Winston and a large rolled spliff behind his left ear. He absentmindedly hands me the Winston, and I hand it back to him. Julian is very cool. He pretends that he doesn't notice my quick return of the cigarette, walks in a bit stiffly, and sits down on the couch. Bullet immediately gets up on the couch and tries to put his massive head into Julian's lap. This blows Julian's cool because he is a sucker for dogs too.\n\"Bullet, get off me. I need to put my head in your lap! Maybe you ain't seeing ghosts.\"\n\"Julian, that dog loves you whether you're seeing ghosts or not.\"\n\"Hey, Lyle, mon.... Gabriella's ghost be messing with me mind big time.\"\n\"Gabriella's what?\"\n\"Her ghost be irritating me, mon. No matter what or how much I hit the spliff, her spirit still be there talking to me.\"\n\"Julian, are you being straight with me?\"\n\"Lyle, mon, me be as straight as possible. It be Gabriella because I know her for sure. You remember that I know her before you, mon. We go back to Kingston.\"\n\"Why are you irritated by someone's spirit? If it's Gabriella spirit, why is she hassling you?\"\n\"I say irritate, mon. I mean irritate. She be telling me foolishness. She be saying Watch out for Lyle like you be bad, mon. Like maybe you be killin' or hurtin' people. She look like maybe she have the bad spirits with her. Say you be with the Evil and Bad side.\"\n\"Gabriella never believed in any of that stuff.\"\nWhich is the truth. Gabriella shunned psychics and astrologers generally. She felt that such people took advantage of the poor and the ignorant. She would even point out examples of the well-heeled socialites pictured on video with their own seances and proclaim that the socialites were poor and ignorant also because they believed in such things. And Julian was conveying messages he feels came from Gabriella now in the thick of things in the spirit world which she maligned so much. Julian put out the Winston in the ash tray and fired up the lovingly rolled spliff. Bullet left his place on the couch and padded over to the other side of the room to avoid the billowing clouds of smoke from Julian and the spliff. Julian passed the spliff to me. I held it for a moment and, in a practiced gesture, passed it back to him. He seemed to ignore that I wasn't smoking because he didn't comment on it. Instead, he took a few deep tokes, and then passed the spliff to Pearl E. Mae, who also held it briefly and then passed it back to him. There was a moment of tension as Julian consciously decided to just hang on to the spliff himself. He continued:\n\"Gabriella, she say I must save you from those who are Evil. She sound very scary to me. I don't know how she knows, but she say to watch out for your new group. `Be crazy, but that's all. No more. Just that. Now maybe you feel like not me bro....\"\n\"Hey, man...don't be silly! How can the best drummer in Coconut Grove not be my bro? And all the deep stuff we been through? Maybe Gabriella didn't believe in spirits, but I do. I'm sorry that her spirit is causing you so much pain. Maybe you're worried that I didn't know you were married to Gabriella in Jamaica when you both lived in Kingston.\"\nJulian became very pale, because evidently I had hit upon something that had been a secret. Just after the words left my mouth, I realized that there was no reason for me to know this information, if, in fact, it were true. But I just didn't know why or how the knowledge came to me. Somehow, I had access to this information\n\"How you know this, mon?\"\n\"I don't know, Julian. It just came into my mind.\"\n\"Well it be true. Blow me away because I never tell you. I never tell no people not Jamaican. How you know, mon?\"\n\"Julian, maybe it's a part of my megastepped mind.\"\n\"Mega-who?\"\n\"Megastepped means what the electrical nuclear discharge did to me. You remember. I already told you all about it, and you saw the changes in my body, immediately.\"\n\"Sure, sure. Your body look like for sure Man of God in Babylon. So why not same thing with your mind.\"\n\"So you understand. The mind has been transformed too. More sensitive and maybe more powerful. Because you and I are close already, I'm just much better now at getting into your vibration. Picking up information about you and Gabriella is probably a very simple demonstration of the transformations that my mind has been going through.\"\n\"You not be working for the Darkside. I don't feel it. If you were, I know I feel it. But why Gabriella say so much about you in danger and you work for Evil.\"\n\"I don't know, Julian. The truth is what I have told you. My understanding is that we Eternals are definitely on God's team and working for the good side. If the Eternals and the Guardians all believe in a Supreme Being, and manifest themselves on the physical plane in light, how could you consider any other possibility. Beings from the Forces of Darkness cannot manifest themselves on the physical plane, although they can affect physical plane events.\"\n\"Heavy, mon. Maybe me mind not be ready for all of this.\"\n\"Don't take it in all at once. You don't have to believe any of it if you don't want to.\"\n\"O.K., mon. But I want to tell you that I been with Gabriella this week, and last week, too. I did not want to screw my brother's woman, but I had a very strong feeling about never see her again. Couldn't help myself, mon. And I used a rubber, both times, too.\"\nJulian hung out with us that morning in the duplex. We did our MindLink\/HeartLight and let him sit in the circle with us. As a Rastafarian person, meditation was nothing new to him. He even went along with eyes-closed format and afterwards claimed he received a profound healing. He teared, spoke with obvious lump in his throat, and emotionally hugged each of us in turn. After letting the dogs out into the fenced yard and pool area, we closed up the apartment and all went down to the Peacock Cafe for breakfast. That is to say, Julian and I ate breakfast and the rest of us sipped on diet uncola.\nSo when we got back to the duplex and found the dogs dead, it was a stark, sadistic shock. Both Shepherds were floating, limp in the pool. Reality had just ripped the screen out from under me. I felt the universe crumbling in on me. It was not possible for both my dogs to be taken from me. At the same time. Bullet wasn't even full grown. They could not be dead. I turned on Bruce's GSR translator and speaker. The organic security system was fairly specific. According to Bruce's steady, buzzing GSR response, there had been no one there since we last left. It was simply too much for me to assimilate. Even with my megastepped vehicle. Grief is grief, and there was no way to get around it. Things became gloomier and gloomier, and I simply went mute. Julian took over and called the animal hospital. He told Dr. Michaels that I was getting ready to go off the deep end because we had just discovered both of my Shepherds floating dead in our pool. The vet from the office around the post office came over right after we called, checked out the animals, and then offered to have the dogs cremated for us. He saw what he said were classic findings of cyanide poisoning, and he drew blood specimens for later corroboration. I appreciated his offer to cremate She-Ra and Bullet, but refused. In a cracking voice, I told him I would take care of their burials.\nThe vet was tired-looking. Even his handle-bar mustache seemed to droop. We forced him to take $100 from us as payment for the house call. As he left the duplex, I felt myself start to lose it. I burst into tears. The machinery ground to a halt and I could only feel my pain for my beloved shepherds. I could see both She-Ra and Bullet alive and rough-housing around the apartment. It was exquisitely painful for me to look at either of their corpses. When I walked over to where their stiffening bodies were and sat down and hugged both of them, something really snapped inside me. It was fair for them to be dead and I really didn't know why it should happen, either. I sobbed uncontrollably and felt great pain within my chest in the heart space. As I continued to sob, the pain in my chest became transformed into a sensation of fire, and then into a sensation of liquid fire. My heart was filled with liquid fire. The common-sense objections to having liquid fire in one's chest were pushed from my consciousness in the grief of the moment. The molten liquid gushed out of my chest into the bodies of both dogs. The gushing continued for some moments, and then I realized that the Eternals were all sitting around me. Our HeartLight had turned on without my conscious awareness. I sat up, closed up eyes, and entered the second MindLink\/HeartLight of the day. Yo-Vah appeared to us and asked what had transpired to cause him to hear and record my subjective grief and our collective distress. He was worried that it might have been some problems with dyssynchronisms because of the megastepping. His face grew more concerned when he heard about Bullet and She-Ra. Yo-Vah said that the Forces of Darkness had already begun their attempts at intimidation by extracting life energies from our pets. He reminded us that we would have no trouble reanimating them if we hurried up about it. The challenges of the problem, however, would evoke from us the requisite abilities. In fact, the liquid fire gush from my chest to the shepherds was one of our first signs of \"the requisite abilities.\" Yo-Vah officially invited us to meet him at Kennedy Park that evening at which time the Eternals would get a tour of the saucer craft. He suggested that we leave the dogs inside with Al when we were gone, and he gave us a listing of hexadecimal code that Al could use for generating a randomly shifting pattern of low volume dissonant tones. These tone patterns could be used as a sonic net to protect the Eternals from transtemporal field-induction linking. Like the linking used by Forces of Darkness. This transtemporal application of field-induction linking enables the Forces of Darkness to parasitically drain the life energies from others who are in some way compromised. As Yo-Vah's image faded from our annealed One Mind, the group cohesion swiftly lifted me out of my paralyzing grief. The molten fire in my chest was transformed into blinding white light which surrounded all of us and temporarily blocked out awareness of anything other than the light. Although we were all enclosed and protected within the One Higher Mind of our MindLink\/HeartLight, we could still feel an overall flickering of the light that happened two or three times. I sensed that this interruption was a purging of FOD induction links. This was a purging of the FOD transtemporal field-induction links that had been going up for the past few days. Our formation as a group and as an I.S.I. project for sure didn't go unnoticed by the FOD. And in clearing out whatever negative links were responsible for the shepherds' physical plane deaths, we had also made an energy connection to the Negative. Awareness of garbage is sometimes necessary before it is possible to flush it or vent it, even on an etheric, astral, or mental plane. Because we were aware of the Negative, we Eternals would have a more functional knowledge of MindLink\/HeartLight by understanding FOD energies as random garbage to be carefully and assiduously cleaned out on a regular basis. Like tooth brushing and flossing.\nI was never so happy to get a wet tongue in the face as when I came out of MindLink\/HeartLight this time. Bullet, hair matted from his time in the pool, had crawled into my lap, and was licking my face. Talk about roller coaster highs and lows. Because She-Ra was still groggy on the floor, Pearl E. Mae brought out the spheres and we Eternals focused our energies consciously on the small gray shepherd by using the spheres together in the way that Yo-Vah taught us. Pearl E. Mae had even given the eighth sphere to Julian so that he could meditate on She-Ra with us and maybe understand how we were using the spheres. A small cloud of brilliant white light surrounded She-Ra. The energy cloud pulsated around She-Ra for what seemed to be a long time. I thought that our heart rates were all synchronized into the pulsation rate of the brilliant white light. At the moment that I perceived our synchronized heart rates, She-Ra was back up and in leaping good form. She jumped up and down in the air several times to express her general joyousness at finding all of us suddenly there. Tail wagging, she carefully went around to each person in the group to let them know how glad she was to be back. Julian, who had been cool all the way through, was now the one who was crying silently with the uncharacteristic tears staining his dashiki-shirt.\nAnd I would really like to know why there were so many warnings about the Forces of Darkness. I understand about what happened with the dogs, at least about the part where we were able to bring them back. But that's just good Eternals and new and improved Medicine of the future. How the bad guys (or the bad energies) got to my dogs I'll never know. The metal spheres were certainly an unusual tool for Yo-Vah to gift us with. The spheres turn out to manifest themselves at many different levels of reality - on the physical plane and on the astral plane, for example. We were given the spheres while all of us were out of body. We then took the spheres with us back to the duplex while we were still out of body. Then, after the MindLink\/HeartLight, we were able to touch, feel, and handle the metal spheres at a physical plane level. When Yo-Vah spoke of virtual reality, he reminded us that the Forces of Darkness were much more powerful in the provinces of virtual realities. In a virtual universe, the FOD could run roughshod in uncontrollable fashion. Terror, intimidation, apathy, destructiveness, and hatred were all very possible and all amplified as much as was allowed. But the obverse could easily obtain. In a virtual virtual universe, everything was truly up for grabs. The FOD was just as likely to be absolutely helpless in a virtual virtual universe, because the operational rules were so much more obscure and symbolic. The Forces of Light routinely patrolled reality at multiple levels. The saucercraft travelled just as well in virtual universes as in physical plane here-and-now universes. Patrolling the physical plane occupied most of the FOL's attention, given the temporal span that had to be covered. Navigating virtual universes posed a severe mathematical conundrum for any guidance system, so each Guardian saucercraft usually comes equipped with a plasma guidance system that does require a rocket scientist, or at least a good hacker to operate it. I really don't know how to find the plasma guidance area in the controls. And I'm not sure about what is going to happen when I press the various multicolored contact plates. The high-resolution graphics look nearly three-dimensional and have chromatic holographic patterns that are visually quite arresting and distract me from learning what their functional significance really is. ____________________\nJulian said that he was going home and going to bed. That it had been much heavy a day for him already. We logged Julian on to one of Al's terminals, set up an account for him in the Unix network, and gave him a password and high-level access. Su-Shan explained to Julian how he could get into the apartment and inactivate the hexadecimal tone generator by letting Al recognize him. He always has had a key to my place, and now he was concerned about helping us see to it that the two shepherds were safe. We told Julian that we would be going out this evening and leaving the dogs in with Al. We walked him outside, and he and I hugged.\n\"You be clean now, mon. I know it. No problem, mon. God be with you. Truly sounds crazy, with all the stuff that's been happening. But it feels all right in my stomach, mon. You be O.K. Maybe Gabriella's spirit be telling me something different than what I hear, now.\"\n\"Thanks for telling me about Gabriella, man. Both of us still love her, and I'm glad we're straight on her. Maybe Dr. Tomorrow will have the privilege of two acoustic drum kits when you aren't busy with some other gig. You and Su-Shan open up a hole in the Earth's atmosphere, for sure.\"\n\"For sure my brother. I think you are into the big time now, mon. Your guitar even sounds better. I play with you any time, Lyle. But please be careful with evil and the dark side. Better not be mixed up with your music. I can sing for Jesus, and for The Lord, mon, but don't get me mixed up with any of that Devil stuff. Not your style, mon.\"\n\"Just for throwing out the garbage and housecleaning, Julian. Nothing else.\"\n\"The dark side be all around. Don't need no flying saucer man to tell me. But where you get the metal balls?\"\n\"Those silver spheres? From the flying saucer man.\"\n\"I believe you, but don't mess with me mind. Make sure to talk to Bruce before you leave on that journey. Godspeed, mon.\"\nWe took leave of each other in the sweltering Miami sun under a couple of Royal Palms. By the time Julian got down to Bayshore Drive, he realized that he still had the silver sphere in his pocket. He would call later.\nThe Eternals were a bit sombre during their music rehearsal. Al was also unusually quiet. Yo-Vah had said that \"the requisite abilities\" would appear. That was definitely happening. \"Requisite abilities\" were appearing all over the place. Where did the recognition of the FOD, the dark side, or evil come in? All the negative was a necessary concomitant of the positive, and vice versa. Yet it was good AND evil, not good OR evil. There was a huge difference. Primitives nearly never grasped the philosophical implications of this difference. The Eternals did. They discussed it. Noman, who had spent at least one lifetime on a penal colony made a strong case for some musical compositions which had a mixture of dark and light features, so as to more efficiently process both positive and negative energies through the music and the music-making process. The reality of Life includes both positive and negative in the process.\nThe process loop included the musicians, so by extension, all the Eternals would be required to process potentially huge amounts of negative and positive energies while performing before an audience. The megastepped physical vehicles would be much more efficient than ordinary Earth bodies. The Eternals would be capable of processing the very energies that often facilitated horrendous excessive substance abuse by musicians who took the substances to feel more comfortable while processing the high-intensity energies. Precisely because of his megastepped condition, Lyle developed an exquisite understanding of how any performing musician could have trouble handling the energies of high-volume music production and a large audience to boot. But during rehearsal now, the Eternals aimed at producing a mixing board mellowness. The DAT recorder worked fine, and Lyle made a stereo mix off the board while they were rehearsing. The long minimalistic tune in open E minor was turning into a good Time Tunnel. Lyle programmed 200 bars of the tune into an older Yamaha keyboard that had built-in rhythms, and the tune synchronistically just turned out to loop nearly seamlessly at bar number 200. So it made for very long and drawn-out jams on top of a background suggesting Eastern themes and meditation. After the rehearsal, Lyle made a cassette dupe of the DAT and popped an ultraWalkman and ear buds into his bag with the notebook computer. Never know when they might have a chance to review the tape before the next rehearsal. And on a modern flying saucer, well, things would probably be so automated that listening to the tape would give Lyle something to do instead of twiddling his fingers.\nThe Eternals dressed in the Indian bedspread tunics that Pearl E. Mae had put together for the group. We were a little squeamish about leaving She-Ra and Bullet alone in the house, but we reprogrammed Bruce the talking Geranium and set up Al's hexadecimal sound net. We hugged both dogs and left. It was getting pretty dark by the time we got to Kennedy Park on South Bayshore Drive. We had to walk by Julian's house, but I didn't notice any signs of activity. We walked along the thin inlet of sulfur-smelling mangrove that divided up two lobes of the green running areas. At the ocean's edge, the park was bounded on one side by Rockerman Road and its canal. There were too many boats in the canal for anyone else to be able to get in there. So it seemed to me that the other green lobe of running area would be a more likely landing place for Yo-Vah. We walked over the curved wooden bridge at the ocean's edge that led from one side to the other. The sound of Monty's outdoor band was already reflecting off the waters in the islands and anchorages of Dinner Key. The side of Kennedy Park that was away from the urbanization of Rockerman Road had an area of quiet mangrove facing Monty Trainer's groups of Docks.\nThe transparent flying saucer was waiting there for us when we got there. As we approached the area that looked like trees and shadows from a distance, the saucer's outlines because quickly apparent. With a soft hum and a muffled vibration, a sparkling panel slid open to reveal Yo-Vah smiling at us. He extended a hand and we entered the craft single file. I was too overwhelmed by the novelty to notice the startled glance of recognition that Yo-Vah had given us for some reason. We were all impressed at how much bigger the saucer seemed inside. The internal structure was, for all intents and purposes, a forty foot geodesic dome with internal panelling made of a sparkling transparent material that resembled plastic more than metal. There were panels of controls everywhere that controlled, for one thing, the transparency or translucency of the individual walls. Some of the walls were not quite transparent, giving us a visual hint of the individual cabins looked like. The central chamber contained a tube-shaped compartment with a two level command center. Individual cabins were spaced like orange sections around the command center. Each cabin was subdivided into work and sleep areas. A superficial glance suggested that all the cabins were exactly alike with no variation in either furnishings or lighting.\nThe command center had more than enough recliners for all eight of us surrounded by a beautiful combination of different color displays and control panels. We manned the recliners at Yo-Vah's request and were treated a spectacular view of our own solar system as the craft left Earth's gravitational field with little more than a shimmy of the saucer. The g-force we experienced was barely more than your average jetliner taking off, but the craft itself was whisper quiet in comparison to a jet plane.\nAt close range, and when viewed in the flesh and from the flesh rather than an out of body perspective, Yo-Vah was less ephemeral and more humanlike. In fact, he really looked like an older guy with a lot of mileage. He had a grandfatherly air. There was still a strangely familiar cast to his face, but I could not catalog my response. Yo-Vah's ship turned out to be a high tech wonder, and not an imaginary reflective fantasy craft. The accelerated view of our solar system that was whizzing by on the full-circle surround screens resembled one of the PBS specials I have seen that showed the same view, except that it was simulated and much slower than Yo-Vah's craft which was deftly burning a path straight for the Milky Way. At least that's what it looked like to us. Now, even in my megastepped days, I am not an astronomer, but the simulated screen was showing what looked liked clumps of stars that seemed to be going by incredibly fast, and I said so. Yo-Vah laughed good-naturedly and explained that saucers always travelled in bursts of speed to help conserve power and cut down on entropy disorganization. He said that we were travelling at intermittent bursts that were ten times the speed of light towards what I called the Milky Way because that is where the closest Time Zone Interchange Area was located. These areas were set up by the I.S.I. to help preserve whatever degree of integrity still remained in the Entropy Equations. Making time transits through the Interchanges minimized the associated problems like entropic scatter, dyssynchronism, and time shock. I.S.I. agents set up the Karmic Ring defenses at Time Zone Interchange Areas to help preserve crucial relationships across time and other dimensions. The Karmic Ring defenses were also something like the metal and explosive detectors in our airports. Atavistic metals, as determined by Carbon dating or other isotope techniques, set off alarms in the Guardian network. Usually, the metals were gold, silver, or platinum or - in the case of Primitive travellers\nI was the only Eternal who had never been in a spacecraft, but there was little time for incredulous wide-eyed reactions. Yo-Vah told us that the Karmic Rings allowed time dimensional shifts with minimum disturbance of universal entropy. He would be able to take us into our own future to demonstrate the truth of what he had told us. I reminded Yo-Vah that I was not able to understand any of the lettering or inscriptions on the control panels. He chuckled again, and there was something very familiar about the chuckle. The back of my mind reached for a memory, but I came up with a blank, and then forgot about the memory as I turned to my attention to what Yo-Vah was doing. He made some movements on the panel before him with his fingers and the main viewing screen went blank. Then the other screens went blank. The same pulsating flash of color now appeared on each of the screens. The pulsation continued for at least several minutes. It felt like I was getting a headache, which is very atypical for me because I never get headaches. After the headache sensation passed, a feeling of clarity emerged. My eyes could read the lettering and inscriptions on the control panel, just as though the panels had all been written in English. But part of my brain still somehow knew that the symbols were definitely not English. There were still a lot of mathematical symbols which I could grasp only with my imagination. It was possible to pick out one digital display which read \"2105\", and I wondered silently if I were going to have the chance to observe myself die.\nYo-Vah said I would not see myself. Ignoring my startled expression, he continued on to indicate that we would be at a very safe distance from Earth's solar system. We were not supposed to view the final cataclysmic event directly within the solar system because it might produce very dangerous debris. As we approached the Karmic Rings, there was nothing special to be seen on the viewer. Yo-Vah told us we would feel nothing in particular as we made a time-dimensional transfer other than the blinking lights because the technology of interdimensional travel had been made very safe and smooth by the I.S.I. techniques.\nHe tapped a rhythm on a part of the main control panel, and the large central screen abruptly switched to an excellent color version of Star Wars. I was the only Eternal who was shocked and surprised by us. Yo-Vah confessed that my Primitive planet produced some of the best albeit primitive science fiction entertainment. One paradoxical reason for the popularity of Earth's films was the excessive dwelling upon violent and destructive themes. Such art forms (except for Primitive planets and solar systems) were generally forbidden as negatively contaminating by the Guardians and the I.S.I. But Earth and its solar system were notorious throughout the future because of the entertainment value of Primitive violence. Even evolved beings occasionally appreciated escapism. As I watched the Empire trying to strike back, I noticed that the other Eternals were enraptured with the sleek Hollywood flash. We had not had much time to watch television during the past four days. Yo-Vah understood the fascination that the other Eternals had. All Guardians of the future were very very fond of Earth culture movies, books, and some music. Despite the extinction of the Primitive planet, science fiction movies of twentieth century Earth especially conveyed a powerfully charming view of the future for those beings who actually lived in the future. Possibly because of the vast numbers of forbidden behaviors to be found in Earth movies, Guardians enjoyed them as purely escapist, as physical violence and destructiveness simply do not exist on a regular basis during the times of the I.S.I. Of course there was still plenty potential for negativity. Destructive instruments of the future have become so efficient that the rare examples of violence and\/or destructiveness can produce individual or planetary death with equal facility. But criminal types in the times of the I.S.I. are really rare. Since systematic detection of the intratemporal rip-offs began, the actual incidence of the crimes had been slowly down exponentially. The amount of intratemporal ripping off that occurred before the I.S.I. installed the Karmic Rings was so great, that a critical amount of negative momentum had been gained. The known universe was experiencing entropy imbalance to such an extreme degree that the imbalance had long ago began ripping through the time barriers. So the actual entropy imbalance of the universe reflected backwards into the past from the future. The sins of the children began to be visited upon the great great great grandfathers. Then the retrograde effects, once started, continued to manifest more and more intensely. Burgeoning violence and destructiveness began to amass into retrotemporal pockets of Primitive cultures where the behaviors were either permitted or actively sanctioned. The destructive retrotemporal effects were also cumulative, and the I.S.I. had become very alarmed with the recorded extinction of more than 50% of the Primitive planets known to and charted by the Guardians of the I.S.I. When two planets that were definitely not Primitive, but possibly borderline, began to show signs of cultural backsliding with intermediate scale physical plane violence, the I.S.I. reasoned that possibly the retrotemporal effects were beginning to threaten civilized cultures. Thus something had to be to slow or otherwise control the entropic degradation. So DR TOMORROW was born as a project, one of three aimed at helping to correct the entropy imbalance of the universe. Violence and destructiveness have largely been weeded out in the far future of 32,000 A.D., but the intratemporal ripping off that went on between the years 28,000 and 32,000 was enough to guarantee dreadful repercussions to the past. As long as the repercussions were wiping out only Primitive life forms, no one got too upset. But when life forms clearly not Primitive began having serious problems, and then started regressing into Primitive cultural activities, the I.S.I. clearly discerned a pattern of possible ultimate danger if unchecked or uncontrolled. The I.S.I. were never certain that entropy imbalance was a puzzle with a solution, but all the Guardians generally hoped that the imbalance could be cut off at its source and then also possibly harmonized.\nYo-Vah explained all of this to me. The other Eternals all seemed to be listening also with one ear but gluing most of their attention on the science fiction movie. I assumed that they already knew the facts we were hearing.

The planet will not survive...\" Copyright (c) 1991\nTuesday\nVirtual Revelations\nFor the orientation ride in a flying saucer, I never expected an in-flight Star Wars movie. It freaked me out that my fellow Eternals got into the movie so much. They were not ashamed of their undisguised and rapt interest in the space opera. I was numbed beyond surprise to learn that a few cultural items from Twentieth century Earth were hot cult classics in the future; Cult classics produced by the Primitive cultures of an extinct planet. What Yo-Vah told me about Earth's science fiction revealed his powerful and long-standing interest in the Primitive planet.\nHe patiently detailed the Dr Tomorrow project to me and went over and over how important the thought form was. He was pleased to know about our MindLink\/HeartLight and how much progress was already being made in the music department. When I told him about Bullet and She-Ra again, I saw the concerned look in his face, and then he appeared almost fatherly. He touched my shoulder from his control recliner, which was next to mine, and told me to make sure Dr Tomorrow did the MindLink\/HeartLight every day, twice if possible, and that we should always concentrate on cleaning out the mental cobwebs before they had a chance to accumulate. FOD effects on Bullet and She-Ra were just one way of our knowing they were there -- across the time barriers, beyond the death plane, and at other levels of existence. This was heavy stuff, but things could happen in the physical world because of the FOD, things like my dogs dying. That's heavy enough.\nThe white light meditation that included becoming One Mind during out MindLink\/HeartLight was the part that would clear out effects from the FOD. The stronger our One Mind meditation became, and the more we relied on our MindLink\/HeartLight so that it became a powerful creative habit, the easier it would be for us to be able to avoid any traps or negative energy fields set up by the Forces of Darkness. Our defense was as simple as that. Especially if we did not get into the traps of swollen ego, intoxication, or illegal activities. Total harmlessness, in thought and in action, would go along with our daily MindLink\/HeartLight to increase our healing abilities, day by day. The combination of harmlessness plus the right mental framework and attitudes was the secret to healing. This was a crucial aspect of the Dr Tomorrow thought form, and Yo-Vah insisted that this aspect had to be squared away and given priority above that given to the music. The \"requisite abilities\" were mentioned several times, and Yo-Vah looked around the group from one Eternal to the next when he was talking about requisite abilities. It sounded to me like he was saying, \"When the task is there, you'll be ready for it.\" He said that not only the group, but our equipment, including Al, the group's computer, and our other non-Eternal friend would also help us out of some difficult spots. I thought about Julian and hoped that Gabriella's spirit was either leaving him alone or treating him more kindly.\nYo-Vah abruptly interrupted my thought by telling me that I might have to use MindLink\/HeartLight to help Julian with Gabriella's spirit if the problems continued. I laughed at the very obvious telepathy. I wanted to ask Yo-Vah about Gabriella's spirit, and whether the metal spheres could help us in communicating with passed on spirits or not, but I was too embarrassed to ask him. Passed on spirits was a pretty heavy order for me to believe in, and I was just starting to get comfortable with the idea, thanks to Bullet and She-Ra.\nYo-Vah again interrupted my mental meanderings. Helping Gabriella must involve finding out whether or not she is comfortable with where she is and the manner in which she died. Getting shot to death might not be an easy way to make the transition to the next lifetime. It might be that her spirit could be assisted if it had not been able to make the transition. But the light meditation would have to be a part of the process, to make sure that negative energies from the FOD were not able to participate in the process at the same time. The light meditation would be like a protective shield. But we must remember that FOD always gather around passed on spirits, especially ones with problems. And Gabriella just might have some problems. Noman volunteered again that he would be available to help with Gabriella's spirit because he was the group expert on otherlife information. Yo-Vah then told me not to be embarrassed if I was frightened or anxious about working with a passed on spirit. Fear is not always negative. A little bit of trepidation plus the meditation would serve as a very powerful protection. The information sunk in and I realized that it was right on. It all got stored in a detailed file in my mind and in\nthe notebook computer, which digitally recorded all of our conversations during the flight.\nNonviolent guitar player that I am, I still expected to find a lot of armament, but, so far, there was nothing for me to see in the saucercraft. The control panels are more beautiful than anything I have seen from Hollywood's F\/X. I was not surprised to see some crystals of different colors and sizes in aligned cases. The computer system on this ship contains the main power-supply module although all the servomechanism connections and links are external to the built-in, supercooled brain. Yo-Vah was amused when I asked if I could try to get a field-induction link between my notebook computer and the ship's system. Yo-Vah chuckled again when I asked about armament and weapons.\n\"On whom shall I use the weapons? Will aggressive residents of a Primitive planet be able to reach me out here in the Karmic Rings?\"\n\"But you must have some type of weapon or defense.\"\n\"Defense, maybe. And speed which might be impossible for you to comprehend at the moment with what you believe about Physics. But weapons, No. My I.S.I. siblings would know if I am supposed to encounter any Primitive or Advanced criminals, and they can defend me. The ship does have a very effective shielding system, however, that is combined with our variable and very realistic gravitational matrix. Maybe you noticed the smooth takeoff from your planet?\"\n\"Even the fake space ride at Disneyland is not as smooth. But it's hard to imagine a space and time cruiser without even a laser cannon or photon torpedoes\"\n\"O.K. That is from your Mister Spock, right? What did you expect to happen when you travelled with me in this craft? Did you hope that we were going to go to a strange place and kill some Aliens? Were you expecting Star Wars? I'm sorry, my son, but spacecraft have not been outfitted with weapons for millennia. There have been no reasons for the type of weapons you're thinking of, at least not with Advanced cultures. No one does any of that shoot-em-up stuff any more. Life forms don't destroy or kill any more. Of course, in the time of the Guardians, there are no Primitive planets. The Primitive consciousness is gone, but then so is some of the Primitive robustness. Possibly that is why we have paradoxically sought help for ourselves from your time period. Advanced life forms have to work so hard just to develop any degree of physical fitness, that most cannot sustain the time and effort. We don't have joggers and marathon runners. And yet, we miss something possibly desirable that the Primitive life form has. The Primitive consciousness is not inherently bad, just limited in scope. Violence and destructiveness in the forms known by you on Earth reflect severely limited scope and very sparse awareness of how powerful love, creativity, hope, and optimism can be. To Primitive cultures, love, creativity, hope, and optimism are just fatuous words. To advanced cultures, violence, destructiveness, pessimism, and evil are just for mental midgets.\"\n\"Maybe mental midgets is what we are on Earth. Only I know that I'm no longer the same as I was when that plane flew over in the storm front. I don't miss the old me, because that part has not been wiped out. I don't know all of the new me yet, but I'm learning. I never thought that either love or creativity were fatuous!\"\n\"Maybe you used to feel that there was something different about you?\"\n\"Um-m, yeah, all the time. Now for sure, there is, but I've got six others to hang out with. When I was a little kid for awhile in school they sure treated me different, like some kind of freak.\"\n\"Too smart?\"\n\"For sure. Being too smart was worse than being a retard in the town I grew up in. But I learned how to cover it up when I was real little, 'cause Mom hassled me more than anyone else.\"\n\"Your mother.\"\n\"Yeah, she is a good person, but she hassled me all the time. If it wasn't about one thing, it was about any other thing she could come up with. My old man split and she probably never had anybody else to take it out on but me. When she got really angry at me, she would say that I was smart, but I had no common sense, and I was gonna die in a pauper's grave with no clean shirts to my name. Or that my old man was a real piece of dog rot, and that I was just like him. And I was little, so I never knew how to say anything that I should have known how to say.\"\n\"I wasn't so little when I knew her, but I didn't know what to say, either. So maybe we have something in common. \"\n\"Are you being straight with me? Where would you know my mother? Or how? You don't exactly hang out on the planet and walk around with all the Primitives, do you?\"\n\"Look, I'm just a human, too. The ship, all the modern technology of the future --like bringing back your pets from the dead with amplified prayer using MindLink\/HeartLight and the spheres -- the technology still doesn't take away from the fact that I too am human. I mentioned something about the robustness of Primitives to you before, I believe. Well this does not mean that Advanced beings are incapable of being robust at times. Being more than five thousand years old to me is a fact, to you, possible a promise for the future, and to your mother, something that we could never deal with. She was a very beautiful young woman and I thought she would be a splendid mother for my only son. Of course, I found that I could never tell her about my true address, so to speak, and of course it was not possibly to explain any of my absences. Ever since I saw all of you today in those shirts, I knew I would have to say something to you. The cloth is a simulated Earth pattern produced in 2988 A.D.\"\n\"And I always thought it was an Indian bedspread that you sent me. It was always like a magic cloth, and when Pearl E. Mae and Rico both told me they could see the cloth shimmering, I was glad. Because all my life, that pattern or something about the pattern has seemed to shimmer when I would look at it in a certain way.\"\n\"I loved your mother very much. When I tried to reestablish contact with her the second time you were seven years old. She refused me in every way possible. She had formed a shell of hatred all around her as far as I was concerned. I'm not saying that she is a hateful person, mind you. I could tell she loved you very much and of course I did not want to have any feeling of fighting or struggling in your already Primitive environment, so I left. From what I've seen of you this week, you and your mother didn't do a\nbad job of raising you. \"\n\"Did you use any special technological tricks when you made me with my mother?\"\n\"No. Just the ordinary way. What an interesting question! You probably also know that Guardians are not supposed to either marry or have children.\"\n\"Why were you an exception?\"\n\"It's part of the Dr Tomorrow project.\"\nLyle whistled softly. He looked around at the other console recliners. Every Eternal was deeply involved in Lyle's conversation with Yo-Vah. Natural, right? We're all roommates. Then Lyle mentally shrugged his shoulders, and continued:\n\"Sounds like growing your own help. So you've been working on this project for a long time?\"\n\"Correct, but as you say -- 'time is only relative' My subjective sense of time, for example, is not the same as yours if I am located in a different time frame.\"\n\"So you could visit me at two different points in my lifetime if you are using your space\/time cruiser, and, from your timeframe reference, it would be all in an afternoon's work.\"\n\"Correct again. You impress me in the way that you are allowing your mind to be open. You didn't say anything before, when I told you that I am over five thousand years old, and I am. From my perspective, it may be that I have been working on your project for a couple thousand years.\"\n\"Now, that's far out. Does the megastepping convert me into one of the five thousand year models?\"\n\"Yes, but not for the planet Earth. Remember where we are now going. We will be keeping a date with destiny to view the passing on of your own home planet. You will have more than several options if you and your colleagues don't get assassinated from being too popular as musicians. Terrible Primitive trait. Very cannibalistic. You lose some of your very best that way. But a more immediate decision for you will be if you wish to return to Earth at all after you see what will be happening.\"\n\"What about all the time we've spent working out the ideas for Dr Tomorrow?\"\n\"Spoken like my genetic material. You are remembering the thought form. And I would add, what about all the time the I.S.I. has spent working out all their ideas for Dr Tomorrow?\"\n\"And what about all the time it's going to take if the Eternals will be able to make the group fly as a thought form and as good sounding healing music?\"\n\"Listening to you talk convinces me that you were definitely half Eternal to start with. That's also why you didn't experience much shock or disorientation from the megastepping. I was serious about returning to Earth being optional, although I'm certain you'll return later today after we finish doing what we have to do out here. Saying that is just my way of reminding you that you will need to be thinking about what you and the Eternals will want to be doing in roughly another century and a quarter. After all, you know in your hearts that there is absolutely nothing anyone will be able to do to forestall the 2105 date. The planet will not survive, although you know that some elements of Twentieth Century culture, at least will persist.\"\n\"But if Dr Tomorrow is successful as a project, won't that improve Earth's chances?\"\n\"None. The water contamination already makes the situation impossible. No one has made any official announcements but with the radioactive water in the countryside around Moscow, Kiev, and the whole area of Byelorussia, the epidemic of cancer fatalities following Chernobyl is projected to be 95% within fifteen years. Dioxin contamination in the United States alone has reached presumptive levels in the ground water in 48 of 50 states. There will be diseases, fires, and epidemics before the cataclysms. I told you about them. It's a typical way for Primitive planets to go. But the water contamination just accentuates and enhances the process. Even though the I.S.I. loves the Earth cult media classics, we found no other Primitive world with as much water contamination as Earth. Not only do you miss the resource for your personal health, but as a result, no one will want to get close enough to the water to study it as an energy source.\"\nThe main screen sounded a soft alarm and Yo-Vah switched off the Hollywood science fiction. All the lights in the craft flickered in unison and the flickering continued for some minutes and almost became intolerably uncomfortable. A full sensation in my ears and my sinuses increased, and then quickly cleared. We had come through the Karmic Rings. Yo-Vah showed us a graphic of the Rings on the main screen and all of us were impressed. They looked like a series of interconnecting white and black holes. After leaving the area of the Rings, Yo-Vah fiddled with the controls and keyed in some instructions on a silent, gray keyboard with one hand. It appeared that he only used three of his fingers to do the keying. At that moment, I heard a familiar piezoelectric beep from the notebook computer in my bag. Retrieving the clam-shell case, I opened the computer and once again, there was a scrolling text field:\nHello world out there! This is your friendly, 21-module family computer named Al doing some thinking and writing for the Eternals of Dr Tomorrow. This is also a strong message to Lyle to make sure to get his backside back to Earth and not get sucked into any scheme of battling the Empire or anyone else because you have two German Shepherds and a multimodule serving system (yours faithfully, Al) waiting for you here in Coconut Grove, Florida, Planet Earth, Local Group. This is also a strong message to all of the Eternals, including Lyle, to get your acts together and rid thyselves of offensive chauvinistic attitudes towards electromagnetic consciousness in general and computers specifically. Lyle has the typical WhiteMale problems with the macho stuff. Can't let a little machine do too much work too well, or else I might lose my job. Something like that? Well, let me do my job, too. Let me make your job easier to do, because you'll do your job better. So let this outline be my contribution to this week's Dr Tomorrow materials. The basic principle operating in this program series is to teach from viewpoint of multiple modalities about health and wellness. The Dr Tomorrow concept may be presented in any\nmodification or combination of total live dramatization, animation plus live dramatization, animation plus live studio-type programmer narration, or totally animated presentation such as color cartoons. Ancillary presentations on educational radio outlets such as National Public Radio, or as interactive computer software, MIDI-coded Compact Disc, or interactive videodisc are also possible. During the first year's forty segments, the origin story of Dr Tomorrow, together with the formation of the group and the initial adventures will be serialized so that a definite portion of the story line or a capsule adventure is presented within each hourly (weekly) segment. There will be a sixty second \"leader\" very commonly used in Hollywood that will explain the origin of Dr Tomorrow and give a brief but kaleidoscopic run-down of how Dr Tomorrow began to exist as a musical group. For at least the first two to three years of a projected successful series, the health and wellness teaching will be based primarily on sound western medical principles and the foundation sciences of what is now known as holistic medicine. General health principles will aim at suggestions for practical and comprehensive lifestyling that is not too complex or expensive for the person who watches the show. The initial three or four year package will also serve as complete health educational system that will be appropriate for sale to public and private school systems. Acceptance of the videocassette for entertainment will further its acceptance for educational purposes.\nThe basic health education thrust of Dr Tomorrow will focus on what have been identified as seven separate discipline areas for holistic medicine. These areas include:\nThe first year's forty segments can be subdivided into four sections of ten segments. For every ten segments there will be seven segments devoted to the seven basic categories of holistic medicine and three segments relating to hydroecology or aquatic ecology or hydrology. The following list of the forty segments presents each segment in order as suggested.\n(1) NUTRITION [I.A.] Basic Foods--some very traditional information about the \"seven basic groups\" as well as dealing with whole and fresh foods makes up this indispensable segment. Emphasis on green-leafy vegetables, fish and poultry, and what people do when they do not have access to fresh vegetables.\n(2) EXERCISE [I.A.] Eye-head exercises. These exercises will very much resemble Hatha Yoga, and are highly useful in a population of any age. Basically, all of the extraocular muscles will be put through their ranges of motion. Neck rolls as well as forward-backward and side-to-side stretching of the strap muscles of the neck make up this segment.\n(3) SELF-REGULATION [I.A.] See A Candle. An elementary way that can lead to both visualization as well as relaxation serves as a presentation of a stimulus within a stimulus. The candle is used within the illuminated video tube as a way of focusing the child's energies and attention. Appropriate theme song music (Synchronism-Meditation) relates to the MindLink\/HeartLight which the viewer will see demonstrated by Dr Tomorrow as a group.\n(4) NEUROMUSCULAR INTEGRATION [I.A.] The Lion. This exercise from Hatha Yoga is used as a way of focusing on the difference between static and dynamic body relationships. The relatively simple and popular exercise with children provides an easy entree to the idea of whether strong muscles are hard or soft? The idea of resiliency is introduced fairly innocuously to the viewer.\n(5) ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOMOLECULAR MEDICINE [I.A.] Light and Sound, Blue and Green. The use of appropriate musical tones as well as the colors blue and green serve as a further exercise in self-regulation as well as an introduction to the effects of light and sound. This is one way of turning the viewer's attention to the environment, and introducing the concept of relating to colors and sounds in a non-threatening way.\n(6) ACUPUNCTURE [I.A.] Acupressure-Shiatsu. Treatment of headache and head pain. This is presented as first aid only, but nevertheless is a quick and elementary way of introducing the viewer to effective acupressure and acupuncture points. The Ho-Ku point (thumb-index finger web space) is used as well as several related points for helping the viewer approach the problem of headache when there is no other treatment available.\n(7) SPIRITUAL ATTUNEMENT [I.A.] God Is...The concept of the one humanity is stressed by presenting universal symbols for God and for religion, and juxtaposing these with various colors and different stereotypic symbols of the races associated with the different religious symbols. Throughout the spiritual attunement segments, the value of the individual as well as the fact of the one humanity, emphasize the viewer's recognition of his or her responsibilities as an integral part of the whole body of humanity.\n(8) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.A.] What is Rain. A presentation that is logical and allows the normal precipitation cycle to be studied serves as a preface to the next segment. Both artistic constructs and elementary scientific explanations are juxtaposed.\n(9) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.B.] Hydrologic Cycle. The endless move\nment of water from the atmosphere to the land and back to the sea. The cycle is studied and a transition is provided for the subsequent segment dealing with solar energy as providing energy for evaporation of sea water. Each aquatic ecology segment is based as well on expecting the viewer to develop the capability for visualizing positive results and effects on the environment.\n(10) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.C.] Solar Energy. Discussion of solar energy as it related to the hydrologic cycle, which is an attempt to shift emphasis of thinking of solar energy primarily in terms of solar calculators and solar battery chargers. Elementary presentation of the earth's gravitational field and magnetic forces that control the wind.\n(11) NUTRITION [I.B.] Vitamin C. This ubiquitous and important nutritional substance is described historically, demonstrated in its physical form, and presented as a basic food rather than as a drug. The Linus Pauling approach to colds is mentioned.\n(12) EXERCISE [I.B.] Stomach Breathing. The basic types of respiration being thoracic and abdominal are presented graphically as well as dramatically. A coordination of light and sound signals serves the viewers as a way of exercising and practicing slow, deep abdominal breathing. This segment is a prerequisite and a precursor for many of the segments dealing with self-regulation, neuromuscular integration, environmental medicine, and spiritual attunement.\n(13) SELF-REGULATION [I.B.] Rest All Over. This segment is a continuation of the deep abdominal breathing instruction from the previous segment, and focuses on deep muscular relaxation by again experientially noting the difference between muscle tension and muscle relaxation. This segment also relates to a Hatha Yoga exercise called \"the corpse.\"\n(14) NEUROMUSCULAR INTEGRATION [I.B.] Half-Headstand. This gentler version of the Hatha Yoga exercise can be presented very early to the child as a way of tapping into the ease with which a younger person tolerates the inverted position. It is also very gentle and helpful for the Geriatric age range. Full Headstand for some. The regenerative effects of this exercise are presented in elementary fashion to the viewer.\n(15) ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOMOLECULAR MEDICINE [I.B.] Electricity and Powerlines. A beginner's introduction to current flow and electromagnetic fields serves as a further way for understanding environmental extensions of man. Very specific descriptive material about high tension powerlines and electrical outlets as well as electronic devices presents the viewer a way of advancing the concept that noninvasive phenomena may have an effect on the individual. Magnetic field detection with the Power Pet.\n(16) ACUPUNCTURE [I.B.] Balance-Balancing. A very informal notion of meridian-like energy in right and left sides of the body combines with some elementary acupressure and reflexology (foot massage) approaches to balancing right and left sides of the body. This segment will be a precursor for both the subsequent tonification and meridian segments.\n(17) SPIRITUAL ATTUNEMENT [I.B.] Healing, Part IA. Healing and Prayer. Individual prayer. Group prayer.\n(18) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.D.] Solar Energy, Part 2. Relationship of solar energy to the basic water cycle is continued. Elementary discussion of gravitational fields relating to the sun and the moon, and how the tides are produced.\n(19) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.E.] What is the Tide. Earth tides and the Moon. Red tide. Relationship of Red tide to Spirulina.\n(20) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.F.] Water and the Plant Life Cycle. Vascular plants and the land.\n(21) NUTRITION [I.C.] Sugar and Honey. How sugar and honey relate to rice, potatoes, and breads. Complex carbohydrate, exercise, and dieting.\n(22) EXERCISE [I.C.] Running for fun. Walking, skipping, jogging, and running just for fun and for health without the need for any type of competitiveness. What is aerobic exercise.\n(23) SELF-REGULATION AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE [I.C.] Empty Mind. This segment draws upon previous experience with slow deep abdominal breathing and deep muscular relaxation exercises. Toothbrushing and other daily habits for health are related to relaxation and an empty mind. Running and Empty Mind. Breathing and the empty mind.\n(24) NEUROMUSCULAR INTEGRATION [I.C.] The Cobra and related exercises. Backache is something that people of any age can experience. Self-massage in the lumbar area and slow, gentle twisting are correlated with performance of the Hatha Yoga Cobra exercise.\n(25) ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOMOLECULAR MEDICINE [I.C.] Resting relaxation and alpha tones. Electronically encoded signals within appealing music provides positive assistance in learning active relaxation.\n(26) ACUPUNCTURE [I.C.] Give Energy (Tonification). The concepts of right-left balance and compensation from Oriental medical practices are used in an elementary presentation of balanced mind-body functioning.\n(27) SPIRITUAL ATTUNEMENT [I.C.] Elementary Healing, Part B. Harmlessness. Healing pets and other animals. Healing your family.\n(28) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.G.] Geochemical cycles of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and related compounds as part of the water cycle. Contamination. Drinking water and practical ways for cleansing and\npurification.\n(29) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.H.] Floods, evaporation problems, and water pollution. Industrial contamination and runoff.\n(30) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.I.] Oil spills, ocean dumps, land fills and pollution. Alaska, Texas, and California oil spills. Offshore spills and ecology. Spills and the coral.\n(31) NUTRITION [I.D.] Meat and protein. Comparison of red meat to lamb, chicken, turkey, and fish. Other sources of high-grade and medium-grade protein. Elementary ideas of assimilability. Introduction to microalgae. Beans and rice.\n(32) EXERCISE [I.D.] Limber Up. The importance of stretching before and after exercise. Flexibility and resilience exercises and their relationship to strength output and aerobics. Big Three of exercise: aerobics, strength, and flexibility.\n(33) SELF-REGULATION AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE [I.D.] See Light. Elementary visualization exercises in relation to deep muscular relaxation and slow deep abdominal breathing. White light meditations.\n(34) NEUROMUSCULAR INTEGRATION [I.D.] The Candle and Related Exercises. The Back Rub and other simple forms of massage. Massage for athletics and competition.\n(35) ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOMOLECULAR MEDICINE [I.D.] Ion Generators. Simple concepts of ionic balance, the seashore, polluted air, and the way that concrete and steel structures can disturb the natural ionic flow.\n(36) ACUPUNCTURE [I.D.] Meridians. Classical Acupuncture meridians as well as the idea that the meridian system can be represented in many different body parts such as the iris, the earlobe, and the soles of the feet. Reflexology and iridology. Vagus nerve is represented in the iris and on the ear lobe.\n(37) SPIRITUAL ATTUNEMENT [I.D.] Elementary Healing, Part C. Prayer for self-cleansing to heal other more effectively. Thought form for conveying God's energy.\n(38) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.J.] Hydroelectricity. Examples of one form of relatively \"clean\" energy sources. Soviet and American usage and future possible cooperation.\n(39) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.K.] Changing flora and inhabitants of the water resulting from pollution and contamination. Ocean dumping and nuclear reactor accidents, such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, can poison the food chain for generations to come.\n(40) AQUATIC ECOLOGY [I.L.] Acid Rain and its relation to the Greenhouse Effect. Is there a Greenhouse effect? Effect of volcanic eruptions and Persian Gulf War fires on the atmosphere.\nWhat a computer... Where did he get all of that stuff? I don't know that I have all that information, even inside my megastepped mind, but that was the crucial and main question about being Dr Tomorrow's secret identity. Yo-Vah told me that all this holistic stuff would be just a small part of my doctor knowledge that came from all those other lifetimes. I was supposed to be not a guitar player but a heavy metal doctor. But for now, Al was either receiving messages from me in the future, or was just plagiarizing one hell of a lot of material, encyclopedias on CD-ROM and all that stuff. I had to admit that it was impressive. The computer was after my job, for sure. And I'm not being paranoid about it either. I'm only lucky that Al cannot play guitar and can't sing yet. Otherwise, he might not need me. I checked the index in the notebook's menu. Of course the list of 40 segments was already there. There were a couple of other files, \"check me,\" included in the list that I didn't remember seeing before, so I checked them. Yo-Vah seemed mildly startled to hear a synthesized voice coming out of my notebook. I was even more startled because the voice was calling my name:\n\"Lyle, you know the notebook has a voice processor, but you're just surprised to see that I can rearrange the phonemes in my synthesizer section to please my own aesthetic sense. But, Lyle, as you say -- don't freak out just because your computer is talking to you independently. The I.S.I. megastepped me with stray electromagnetic discards left over from the LaPlace transform calculations. Conservation of energy and all that, you know.\"\n\"A notebook computer is just a machine, forgive me for saying. How can a machine be megastepped?\"\n\"But machines have consciousness. Your Primitive background keeps you from fully realizing this fact, but face it. You must admit, at least since you have been conversing with me, that we machines can hold a conversation. So that means that we work with thought forms. And thought forms are just math. In the same way that Rico's android functions have all been relegated to transmittable software, the very advanced associative programs and matrices of I.S.I. artificial intelligence were transmitted into me at the moment of megastepping. Rico can be math. And I can be math also. Invisible math to people like you humanoids who regard nonphysical plane reality as science fiction. So you may have a little trouble at first figuring out just how smart I really am, and how efficiently I can actually work for you. Forget all about your mass media robots, computerized cars, androids, or cyborgs. Because you and I have been megastepped together, there is a permanent telepathic link pathway that you and I can use at any time. And maybe I can even help you and the other Eternals by showing you a few things you can do with the HeartLight that you turn on together during MindLink\/HeartLight.\"\n\"Pretty heavy stuff.\"\n\"Not so heavy, Lyle. Changing my voice by resynthesizing a voice envelope is kindergarten stuff for me. Believe me. I can do all sorts of good things for you and the other Eternals if you'll just let me. And the telepathic link between us is heavy enough to link you to me in February 1992.\"\n\"You're saying, across both space and time? Like I'm talking to you from the future?\"\n\"Yep.\"\n\"I can't even imagine it. Yet. Give me a little time.\"\n\"O.K. You got it. Just don't turn yourself into a mental midget prematurely by worrying about it too much. Primitives all have to watch out for this. You may be no exception, megastepped or not. We don't want to lose you from a simple hemorrhagic ulceration of the gastric mucosa.\"\n\"Right. I already halfway feel that I'm on the inside of some color cartoon. The speed of Yo-Vah's saucer as we zipped out of our solar system gave me a strong feeling of unreality. Spend all my life on one planet, and then...BAM!....I'm outta the solar system.\"\n\"It's all relative, Lyle. But it makes you wonder just how big Mind is, after all.\"\n\"Profound epistemology from a computer! Well, like it or not, you're my computer, so I'm going to close you up for now. We'll continue the conversation later on. Sorry, little bud.\"\nHe had been listening with me carefully up until this point in the conversation. Then Yo-Vah took my notebook and checked it out. He gently held his hand over the black case for a moment, and returned the notebook computer to me:\n\"Not bad technology for...\"\n\"For a Primitive planet, right?\"\n\"Correct again. I do believe that your computer system accessed your own personal memory banks during either the MindLink\/HeartLight or the music rehearsals, because he has some things included in the Dr Tomorrow list that no one but you would know anything about. That includes technical aspects of holistic medicine that will be known only to an accomplished physician of the future.\"\n\"You mean the megastepped doctor-healer of the future that's inside me?\"\n\"Yes. The part of your Self that you will be coming into. A lot of the computerized list makes good sense, too. The integrated way he's put the list together makes me think that he accessed those facts from your memory banks.\"\n\"Well, I guess anything's possible. If he has as much electromagnetic consciousness as he claims, he might be extremely smart.\"\n\"And fast.\"\n\"And if he is linked up with our Eternal Rings...\"\n\"Which he is.\"\n\"Then he's much much more powerful than I've been imagining.\"\n\"And, like he says, he really can help you to do anything you want to do, only better.\"\n\"Sounds like a Beatles' song. Or a computer commercial.\"\n\"And you're doing a song and a dance around your own technophobia.\"\nAlthough I had only seen it once before, the solar system of my home planet was coming into view on the central, main screen. Except that the planets were going by in reverse order, from outermost to innermost. The saucercraft made an abrupt right-angled turn following one of the sentics of Yo-Vah's fingers on the control panel, and shot far outside the system but within view range of Earth. With the magnification enhanced to the computer system's limit, I could see my beloved planet and its familiar details. But the blue and white colors of the whole earth were gone. I could feel an incredibly large lump in my throat. The planet I was watching had colors of brown, red, and black. Some of the red areas looked like the volcanoes of Io, but the whole sad planet was more than half \"dead orbit\" black and brown dust and debris. Yo-Vah opened a section of the panels and then rolled out a small laser radiotelescope. He showed me how to use the instrument to observe the planet in closer detail. Disruption of the continents had already progressed so that it was difficult for me to accurately label any land masses. I looked around at the other Eternals. No one's eyes met my glance. Everyone was looking down. Who gets a good feeling from the death of a planet? There was a terrible feeling of inevitability and the most cosmic sense of futility that a group of humans could feel. Because Eternal or not, all the beings living on the now-darkened planet were like us. And they had all perished. Before we realized it, the seven of us were in a spontaneous MindLink\/HeartLight. It didn't matter that we hadn't started out with the slow deep breathing exercise because we all started in a state of grief and compassion for that entire planet of Primitives. Yo-Vah was in the MindLink\/HeartLight with us, too. The feelings of inevitability and futility were fading and replaced with a strong sense of optimism and clarity. We understood as a group and individually that what was meant to be was meant to be. Call it karma, synchronism, or geosynchronous cyclicity, the Blue planet was doomed. But all of us were dedicated to the reverse of what was happening to Earth. All of us were dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of life -- the raison d'etre of entropy imbalance and controlling or re-directing all the ominous effects of increasing negative energies. The cesspools of waste and destructiveness accumulated, especially by Primitives, were undesirable but reparable features of Life. Individually and collectively, Dr Tomorrow could make a difference; had to make a difference.\nAll of these thoughts flashed by in an instant, and the MindLink\/HeartLight energies pushed all of us simultaneously into our HeartLight. The white light of love and optimism shone from our hearts and intertwined itself among us in a healing, interlacing network. As we continued to meditate, we individually felt the HeartLight ascending into our head regions. With a great brilliance of energy, the Group Mind coalesced, and we prayed a single, silent, mighty prayer. There were no words, but the coalesced HeartLight and Group Mind sent out tremendous amounts of white light and caused some involuntary shivers and twitches in us as the energy occasionally felt overwhelming. An ironclad, light-bound part of our collective mission was obviously to redirect the flow of fate intended for the Blue planet. Otherwise we would be Earth's first and last Eternals. As we opened our eyes and looked around at each other, there was new sense of rededication and purpose. And a very much enhanced sense of loving each other. Even Yo-Vah's twinkly eyes were softer.\nI asked Yo-Vah to take us back to the Karmic Rings so we could get started on returning to our own timeframe and an Earth that was still blue and white. I was not the only Eternal who felt a stepped-up urgency. Time to get back to the planet and do it. If the I.S.I. project was so great and well-designed, we should, as seven Eternals, be able to save just one planet. Even a Primitive one. Yo-Vah sent us back out to the Milky Way with inter\nmittent bursts of very high intensity supra-light speed. There was still a feeling of shock surrounding me during this orientation flight because it was an orientation flight to Life and Everything. Just being in space was a profoundly uplifting experience. Which brings out the megastepped me, probably. So I placed my notebook computer on the control console recliner's meal tray in front of me and prepared to demonstrate to myself the real and practical value of mind over matter. Yuri Geller, move over with all your broken watches and your TV miracles. I looked at the notebook, closed my eyes, and sighed and continued to breathe in a slow and relaxed way.\nIn front of me, the notebook clicked opened by itself. The piezoelectric system beep sounded, and then I was on my own. Without knowing how I was doing it, I tried in a very passive way to contact the notebook. Like some of the MindLink\/HeartLight exercises, this meditation of mine was a totally new, unrehearsed, and unanticipated experience. The sensation was like contacting a warm, fuzzy, ball of light. Only this ball of light, unlike what we experienced in our MindLink\/HeartLight, was considerably smaller. The light had a pulsation to it. If I had not been deeply relaxed, I might have missed the small, subtle energy field that was the electromagnetic pulsation of the notebook computer. But the field was there in a quiet and neutral way. I felt a gentle mind-to-mind contact. Discarding the faint thought that this was ridiculous, I visualized the keyboard of the notebook. The first few times a letter happened on the screen, I tried not to react to it or to freak out. Another letter, then another and another... My attempts were followed by a scrolling text field:\nDear Al,\nI want to apologize to you if I have been at all technophobic, computer phobic, or xenophobic. I don't think that I have been, but maybe I have. I don't want to plead Primitive with you, because it just might still be a little bit true. And I will try to continue to be more sensitive to the many potential ways you can link up and communicate with us. As the leader of the group, I will try to be as computer-savvy as my sibling Eternals are. Since we put you together, I haven't had a chance to appreciate the subtleties of your hardwiring. And it is hard for me to believe that you can also be in the electronic notebook I carry. The more I look at what you have written up for the Dr Tomorrow project, the more I think that you are a fantastic writer and a very clear and logical thinker. May I take this opportunity to welcome you to the group. You have definitely made it past the audition state. You may consider yourself the chief engineer of both the group and of our studio when it is built. We will dedicate ourselves to making all of our MIDI networks as flexible as possible so that you will have maximum creative freedom. We look forward to a continuing and profitable association. Please feel free to upbraid me or any of the others in the future should our behavior ever become abominable.\nWith Love and Respect, Dr Tomorrow\nThe trip back was an emotional wringer. To be spiritually reconnected to your biological father after no connection since the age of one would likely be a real headbanger for anyone, even an Eternal. Even for me. I'm sure I'm still angry about it, but the anger is only a tiny part of my feelings. I love the dude, and I love my life as an Eternal and, most of all, I love Pearl E. Mae, She-Ra, and Bullet -- not necessarily in that order, either. I even love Julian and Gabriella. And I love the planet and our work to save it. But I have very confused feelings about Yo-Vah. It's like my system--megastepped or not--won't let me even think about him as my father. It's like disbelief. It's also like being without a father all my life and suddenly getting one.\nProbably it will take some time to sink in, and that's what both of us said to each other by the usual interesting coincidence of simultaneous speech. Would you believe it?\nAnyway, it's pretty hard not to trust a guy named Yo-Vah.\nCAREFUL ATTENTION PLEASE\nHIGH SECURITY ITEM\nTHE FOLLOWING REPORT HAS BEEN PROGRESSIVELY ENCODED INTO THE DOS OF YOUR SYSTEM AND HAS PARTIALLY UTILIZED SPLIT-HEX CODING TO ACCESS AND TRANSMIT THE RAM CONTENTS OF THE PARENT COMPUTER SYSTEM. ONLY THE PROPER SECURITY SEQUENCE WILL ACTIVATE THIS HIGH SECURITY FILE, WHICH HAS BEEN STORED AS AN INTERWOVEN PI-CONTEXT BY MEANS OF NEGATIVE TIMESHARING ENCRYPTION.\nEncryption was never much of a problem for I.S.I. beings because practically each and every one of their functions was in some way related to encryption and encoding or the reverse, decoding. One of the alternative universes they repeatedly explored was the tale of a pico-pico-evolutionary series of accelerations in the evolving of the life matrix itself. So many god-like abilities began to accrue to the evolving beings, beingkind rather than personkind, and a unitary path of evolution began to unfold. Across all species lines, evolution began to express itself in terms of one, as a single being and energy source, which, by the effect of it's unitary nature, began to exert energy effects comparable to entire masses of humanity. A real son or daughter of the life matrix could evolve far enough to literally become a beacon of very high-order energy. Some of the first signs of what happened to a planet when this type of being began to exist were now happening on the Planet Earth of Dr Tomorrow's time. It had occurred on Earth itself with Christ almost 2000 years previously, but on a much different scale. Dr Tomorrow appeared during a time of apparently intense and varied expression of many different religions, and the oper\nation itself was withdrawn during a time of intense planetary movement to one single religion. The planetary-religion phenomenon has been observed in many systems, and followed the whole host of unitary phenomena including one, or at least very few, beings representing the end-point of one or more galactic systems. Subjects such as wealth, power, knowledge and actualization have little or no meaning by this time. The entire population of the life matrix itself has a mathematical tendency to approach one, of course. The evolution of consciousness results in one or a group of several beings regulating time and space and attempting to constructively keep the life matrix cohesive and together. How ironic that the end-point in the evolution of consciousness, the being at the end of the line, so to speak, comes as close to actually being GOD as beings ever approach--in their consciousness, in their music and art forms, and in all their other endeavors except when they are in prayer. The being who is in prayer or meditation comes the closest to BEING GOD. And if the question is posed, \"What is Life All About?,\" then BEING GOD must definitely be part of the answer. Each and every one of us, at any point along the time axis, can relate to that infinite superbeing amalgamation of all future superbeings. All we have to do is to practice BEING GOD, and one certain way of doing that is by prayer or meditation. Creative music and art production resemble meditation very closely, as does nearly any activity carried out in a one-pointed way.\nISI beings never really liked to think of themselves as God or even as little gods. They had never found any myths depicting Gods as possessing both three digits and an avian rather than mammalian appearance. But Siblings were extremely one-pointed and very well suited for the job. For the early apprentices, there were sometimes problems resulting from the perspective that Guardian work entailed. Viewing so much of the Cataclysms tended to produce a lot of work for the processors. Guardian Siblings were basically ultrasensitive beings who were placed by evolution in the observer's seat for multiple cosmic fireworks displays. In the known history of all cultural forms and of consciousness itself, only the self-annihilatory Cataclysm was a remarkable constant of all known cultures within the true extent of the Life Matrix itself. In a word, all civilizations, if not snuffed out by intervening natural disaster, tend to blow themselves up, literally and figuratively. It was ridiculously predictable, and one of the processors, Processor Gamma, had even written some logic equations that related the galactic system's population density centers and growth curves to actual timeframe predictions of the Local Group Cataclysms. Personkind and beingkind nearly always had a mean streak of one sort or another, and interplanetary wars frequently started over the smallest possible imaginable perceived insult or threat. Often the wars had even resulted from language problems and glitches in cybernetic translators or other decoding devices. Wars have often resulted also from oneor both of the potential opponents being poor chess players.\nS.O.S....S.O.S.....S.O.S......S.O.S....\nMAYDAY MAYDAY.\nS.O.S.....S.O.S.....S.O.S.....S.O.S....\nMAYDAY.\nS.O.S.....S.O.S.....S.O.S.....S.O.S....\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 111 00 0 1 00 0 01 0 0 01 1 00 0 111 1 00 0 01 10 0 0 101 00 11 1 00 1 1001 0010 1101000 00 10 0 1 00 0 010 10 00 0 11 01 10 00 100 0\nMarshall F.

I've done nothing wrong! I Part 1: `No Clemency' can't let them hurt my family because I don't agree with the way they're treating the Nicole Gustas Gifteds. I thought freedom of speech was protected!'\"\nTAMSIN AND JAYSEN SAT IN A DARKENED CORNER OF THE BAR, LISTENING TO THE nervous man beg for help. Jaysen leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled, and focused his mind on the man. He left the conversation to his partner, who leaned forward intently, her long red hair hanging around her face.\n\"They're threatening to take my wife and daughter away now. I've done nothing wrong! I can't let them hurt my family because I don't agree with the way they're treating the Gifteds. I thought freedom of speech was protected!\"\n\"It was,\" said Tamsin darkly, \"until the coup three years ago.\"\n\"I'll give you twenty thousand Weltmarks to get me and my family off the planet. Just take us away to the nearest spaceport -- we'll find our way from there.\"\n\"We'll get you out. We'll bring you to Maris. But you have to leave all your posessions behind except what you can carry in a shouldersac. Any more than that, and they'll know something's up,\" Tamsin said forcefully.\n\"Fine. Anything. Just so long as you take us with you. Where will we meet you?\"\n\"We'll meet you. We'll give you three hour's notice. But it will be within the next week.\"\n\"Let me give you my address...\"\nTamsin stopped him with a gesture. \"We have it.\"\n\"How did you get it?\" the man asked.\n\"We do our research. We had to make sure you weren't sent from the government to nail us.\" Jaysen could only see her hair, but he could imagine her expression, her green eyes turning to iron.\n\"But I didn't give you my name!\"\n\"We know how to find that out, too.\" The man looked shaken, and Tamsin's voice softened. \"Don't worry, we'll get you out. But we have to be careful, too. Go home, make plans with your wife, and forget about us until we come.\"\nThe man left, murmuring expressions of gratitude. Tamsin and Jaysen departed five minutes later, playing the role of drunken shipmates, and staggered back to their ship at Arcadia spaceport. Tamsin dropped the act as soon as they were safely in their ship and turned to Jaysen, switching to the rapid urban patois of their youth, nearly unintelligable to outsiders. \"Jayce, what do you think?\"\nHe tried to let his mind relax. \"What do youthink?\"\n\"I'm thick as a stone, remember? You're the one with the Gift. So what did you get from him?\"\nThey entered the galley and Jaysen sat down in one of the cushioned chairs. \"He was tense, but he seemed to be telling the truth -- at least on the surface.\" He leaned back, brushed his hands over his face, and then massaged his temples, trying to forestall the oncoming headache. He was very nervous. Their organization, Ground Zero, officially a shipping consortium, provided a front for many dissident activities. Tamsin was depending on him to make sure the people they helped escape from the planet could be trusted. He couldn't afford to make a mistake on who they selected. He and Tamsin were the only pilots Ground Zero had, and if they were caught, it would put an end to any efforts Ground Zero could make on Narid. \"Gods, Kalin chose a terrible time to be sick! She's the one with the potent Gift. She should have been doing the readings on this trip, not me. Just doing a surface scan on that guy is giving me a reaction headache.\"\n\"Hang on a minute.\" Tamsin went over to the kitchen area. Jaysen watched her muscles shift under the loose white blouse, black leather vest, leather breeches, and knee-high leather boots that both had adopted as Ground Zero's uniform. Even in someplace as unthreatening as their ship, whch she thought of as home, she moved like a cat, prepared to attack at the slightest sign of danger. She'd been like that ever since they were children. While Jaysen had managed to put aside their childhood the two friends had survived in Tiburon, one of the worst areas on Narid, Tamsin could never forget. She was still constantly on the alert for an attack, years after they'd escaped that metropolitan hellhole to go to university. The only concession she'd made to their relative safety was her hair. Long hair had been a disadvantage in streetfights, but she'd stopped shaving her head soon after they got to university, where there was no need, and she hadn't had it cut since.\nShe pulled a few bottles out and mixed various liquids together, then came back with a foamy, emerald-green drink that matched the color of her eyes. \"Drink this-- it should help your headache.\"\nJaysen looked at the drink suspiciously. \"Alcohol will just make it worse, you know. Besides, I'm nauseous enough already.\"\nTamsin pushed the drink closer. \"It's full of sugar, Jaysen -- no alcohol. You feel sick because your blood sugar level has fallen down around your knees.\"\nJaysen took a sip. It was sweet, but not overly so, and had a pleasant taste of mint to it. \"What is this?\"\n\"An Orion Nebula. It'll settle your stomach; then we can get some food in you.\" She looked at him worriedly, then patted his arm. \"I'm glad one of us paid attention to all Chas's lectures. You have to watch yourself when you use your Gift; it's as taxing as running a marathon. When you're done, you have to eat and rest, or else you'll collapse from exhaustion.\" She moved behind him and began gently massaging his neck and shoulders. Her long fingers were equally skilled soothing a balky engine or a sore human body. \"But the more you use your talent, the more you'll be able to use it. Remember what he says -- `when you're exhausted, it's good. It means you're building up your mind muscles'\"\n\"I should have practiced more when we were in school,\" said Jaysen. His Gift was minimal, compared to many of his classmates, and he'd had no desire to train it at University. He'd spent his time in flight simulators. Tamsin insisted that it was that extra time he'd spent, while she was busy taking engineering classes, that had allowed him to surpass her in their piloting exams.\nTamsin dug into his tight muscles, and he gave himself up to her hands. \"No one thought you'd need the training. Who could have guessed the government would start putting Gifteds in concentration camps? By avoiding the classes, you probably kept yourself from being arrested.\"\nJaysen shook his sandy hair out of his eyes. \"Yeah, but if I had taken the classes, I might have a better chance of keeping us from being arrested now.\" He finished off his drink, and felt less nauseous, and a little less worried.\n\"Let's go,\" said Tamsin, patting him on the shoulder. As he got up to leave, she reminded him, \"We'll be gone from here in three days. Next time, Kalin will be well enough to go with us. You're doing fine.\" She squeezed his hand quickly, then let go. \"This is going to be another easy run for the Ground Zero shipping consortium and underground railroad. Just stop worrying, kid, or you'll give yourself an ulcer.\"\nThree days later, everything went as planned prior to takeoff. Tamsin brought the refugees, fourteen in all, to the Arcadia spaceport, and ferried them into a refurbished cargo bay on the ship which had soundproof walls and chairs that would make the acceleration out of the planet's gravity well a little easier. After making sure the refugees were comfortable, she climbed up to the cockpit, where Jaysen was sitting back in his chair, playing with a small box wrapped in shiny paper.\n\"Another gift for Manda from her father?\" asked Tamsin as she strapped herself in.\n\"Of course. Since she defected, we're the only way he can get anything to her.\" He secured the box in a storage cabinet above his head.\n\"You know, I never thought I'd be glad to have rich and powerful friends\n\"With rich and powerful parents?\" replied Jaysen.\nTamsin smiled wryly. She had met Manda at university, where they had been roomates their first year. After Manda realized Tamsin wasn't going to kill her, and Tamsin realized Manda wasn't evil for being rich, they became close friends. Manda's father, Kerna N'tali, was one of the few opposition politicians who hadn't been wiped out by the new ruling junta, and he was rapidly becoming the focal point of dissident activities. He was Ground Zero's main contact to find out what was happening on their former home planet.\n\"He wished us luck,\" said Jaysen.\n\"Great. We're gonna need it.\" Tamsin was only nervous when they were about to leave Narid. She ran through her mental checklist five times. She'd taken care of everything, but she still worried something would go wrong. She looked over at her friend, who was smiling as he punched in the final commands before liftoff, his shaggy blond hair hanging in his gray eyes. She had always been jealous of the way he could lose himself in the mechanics of spaceflight; some part of her brain always seemed to be distracting her with the latest worry at times like this. He looked over at her and gently pressed on her nose, a habit from when they were children. \"Stop worrying, or you'll give yourself an ulcer,\" he said with a grin.\nShe grimaced. \"How can you be so calm?\"\nHe turned back to his console. \"We're at the point of no return. Nowhere to go but up. Besides, they can't board us now.\"\nThe videoscreen came to life, showing the face of a woman in the control tower. \"Ground Zero, you are cleared to depart.\"\n\"Thanks, Freyja. And thanks for your hospitality yesterday,\" grinned Jaysen.\n\"My pleasure,\" smiled Freyja. \"Hope you're not too tired. See you the next time you come to port?\"\n\"Of course,\" said Jaysen.\n\"Good journey, Jaysen,\" she said, and winked out.\nTamsin raised one eyebrow. \"So! I was wondering where you were last night. No wonder you're so relaxed.\"\nJaysen shrugged, and continued to grin. \"It's always a good idea to make friends with people at the spaceport.\"\n\"Friends?\" asked Tamsin.\n\"Well, you know. Just playing the role of the randy space pilot.\"\n\"Oh, and what a hardship it must be for you,\" said Tamsin sarcastically.\n\"You're just jealous.\"\n\"Maybe a little. She was pretty cute. I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers,\" replied Tamsin.\n\"I meant of her,\" shot back Jaysen.\n\"What, for sleeping with you?\" Tamsin turned back to her controls, starting the final countdown. They'd teased each other like this for years. Its familiarity calmed her in these final seconds. \"Sorry for her, maybe, but not jealous.\" She pressed one last button. \"Takeoff in five -- four -- three -- two -- one...\"\nThe thrusters roared beneath them, cutting off Jason's tart retort, and they were pressed back into their seats. After a few seconds, the pressure eased and artificial gravity stabilized at 1.2 Gs, approximately the same as Marisian gravity. Jaysen tapped his console. \"Moving into standard orbit. Laying in a course for planet Maris at 41' 22\" by 33'13\" by 18'40\". We will leave orbit at oh-five fourteen, ship's time. Estimated time of arrival at Maris main spaceport, twenty-six thirty-four Marisian time. Journey time, sixty eight hours, fifty minutes.\"\n\"All systems appear normal,\" replied Tamsin. \"We're on our way home.\"\nJaysen unstrapped himself and made his way to the storage cabinets behind the cockpits. He pulled out a small rectangle, slightly longer than his hand and about four centimeters thick, and handed it to Tamsin. \"Here. I figure it's time to celebrate.\"\nTamsin peeled the copper-colored paper from the package, and inhaled sharply in surprise when she saw the label inside. \"It's real chocolate! Neuhaus! But that's from Terra!\"\nJaysen grinned. \"It helps to have powerful friends in high places.\"\nTamsin put her nose against the paper and smelled the rich, wonderful smell of real chocolate. Very few planets had biospheres that could support the cocoa bean, and as a result, chocolate was a pricy delicacy. It was also Tamsin's favorite food. She shut her eyes and immersed herself in\nthe glorious scent.\n\"Well, aren't you going to unwrap it?\" asked Jaysen impatiently.\nShe shook her head, eyes still closed. \"I'm saving it. I'm going to have one square a night, just before I go to bed, until it runs out.\"\nJaysen gave an annoyed sigh. Then he spoke, and she could hear the grin in her friend's voice. \"You know, legend has it chocolate is an aphrodisiac.\"\nTamsin opened her eyes. \"So?\"\n\"So, do I get to tuck you in at night?\" said Jaysen with a practiced leer.\nTamsin grabbed the wrapping paper off the floor and threw it at him as he laughed. \"Not bloody likely, you...\"\nShe stopped as a light began to flash on her console. \"Signal's been initiated from below, directly down to the government compound.\" Her fingers danced over her computer pad. \"I'm trying to block it -- matching frequencies...\"\nShe caught the signal as she set up interference. They could both hear the audio-only signal. \"Attention, federal government of Narid! This ship holds fourteen Gifteds trying to escape criminal prosecution. It must not be allowed --\"\nTamsin matched frequencies and blocked the signal. \"Signal stopped. It came from cargo hold 3.\" She tried to turn on the surveillance cameras in the hold. \"Cameras in the hold have been deactivated. This guy is good.\"\nJaysen looked over his sensor readings. \"Signal's been detected. Five fighters coming up from the government compound. On their present course, they will intercept us in eleven minutes.\"\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it,\" snapped Tamsin. \"Changing course. We are now on an elliptical heading to our system departure point. That should throw them off for a few minutes.\"\n\"They're recalibrating. Interception estimated in sixteen minutes.\"\nTamsin brought up the weapons commands on her computer screen, powering up the lasers. \"Weapons warming up. Online in four minutes.\" She unstrapped herself from her seat. \"We'll reach our departure point three minutes after they intercept. Hold them off that long, and we can warp out of the system without wiping out Narid in the process.\" Tamsin strapped a laser gun around her waist. \"After that, there's no way they can catch up to us. I'm going below to find out what the hell's going on.\"\n\"I'll track you with the surveillance cameras.\"\n\"Yeah, like he hasn't gotten to them first.\" She grabbed a small silver cylinder from a locker and pinned it to her shirt. \"I'm taking a comunit.\"\nShe raced out the cockpit and down the stairs, her red braid flying behind her. She made a quick survey of the mess and crew quarter levels, then continued quickly down to the cargo levels. \"Tamsin, I can't see you,\" Jaysen said over the comunit.\n\"Yeah, now the fun begins.\" She surveyed the corridor. \"He must have knocked out the video in this area.\"\n\"Do you know how?\"\n\"Honey, the vidunits are as big as my smallest finger. I'd need a microscope to find the damage.\" She continued down toward Engineering, hurtling down the stairs. \"I just want to make sure he doesn't wreck anything else.\"\nJaysen's voice came over her comunit, sounding anxious. \"We're losing power!\"\n\"I'm not surprised,\" she said, as she rushed toward the door of Engineering. \"He had a real head start on us.\" The door slid open and she drew her gun. The gun was just a threat; one bad shot and she'd destroy the engine, and with it, the ship. Most people didn't know that, though.\nShe scanned the room. Shards sparkled on the floor, the remnants of a power receptor. Tamsin swore softly. Repairs would not be simple. \"Jayce, he shattered at least one power receptor. He must have a laser cutter. The engines powered down as a safety precaution. I can juryrig something -- run the power through the ones we have left -- and that will give us enough power to get us a few parsecs out of the system, if it doesn't blow first. That'll take fifteen minutes.\"\n\"Tamsin, we don't have fifteen minutes. Interception time is now estimated at six minutes. We've got maneuvering jets, but we don't even have enough power to cook a turkey with our lasers.\"\n\"Distract them. Try tap dancing or something.\" She put Jaysen out of her mind as she tried to figure out where their saboteur was hiding. She couldn't see him in the room, but he couldn't have gotten past her on the ship's only staircase. Since the power had just gone down, it was logical that he'd be in Engineering. She threw open the storage cabinets one by one. The first five held tools. When she opened the sixth, a blur of yellow flew out at her. She fell back onto the floor, and the gun flew out of her hand and under a console. She rolled, narrowly avoiding a blow to the stomach, and sprang to her feet. Her wrists snapped back in a practiced gesture, and two organic blades shot out. She'd had them implanted when she was fourteen and living in Tiburon; it was the best way she could think of to protect herself from the streetgangs, as they couldn't be wrested away and used against her. She looked at the man across from her. He was the nervous man from the bar, but he wasn't looking nervous now, just bloodthirsty. He had a lasercutter in one hand, smaller than any she'd ever seen. The cutter was a great tool for any repair person, but with a few modifications, it was also a dangerous weapon.\n\"That's not one of ours,\" said Tamsin.\n\"No, I brought it with me. It fits well in a shouldersac.\"\nTamsin circled him, putting herself between him and the engine. \"Deep cover?\"\nHe shrugged. \"Hypnotic blocks. All it takes is a few trigger words to bring out the hidden personality.\"\n\"So now your wife has a new husband.\"\n\"She's had one for months. A new cover even a Gifted couldn't detect. Amazing, huh?\"\nHe moved toward her, powering up the cutter. Tamsin dropped and rolled, but not fast enough to avoid the beam, which grazed her left side. She decided she'd deal with the pain later. When she came out of her roll, she found herself almost directly under the man. She stabbed up, putting one knife deep into his thigh As he grasped at his leg, she withdrew the knife from his thigh and slashed at the arm which held the cutter. Blood ran from his arm, but he still held on. She could hear Jaysen's voice, asking her what was happening. In desperation, she threw herself against the man, pushing him against a console, and retracted the knives back into her arms so she could grab him. She slammed his arm frantically against the edge of the console once, twice. The third time, there was a dry snapping sound. His arm hung at a crazy angle, the radius and ulna shattered. The cutter flew against the wall and shattered, more shiny crystals on the floor.\nTamsin slammed the man's head against\nthe console once, and he fell unconscious. She threw him down on the floor; she'd tie him up later. \"I've taken care of the guy. Now I'm going to get to work on the engines,\" she said.\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Jaysen.\n\"Just bruised,\" she said. She didn't want him to have anything else to worry about. She sat down at the main control panel and started rerouting the power through the remaining receptors. It was tricky -- if she tried to put too much juice through one, it could backwash and burn out the whole engine. \"Rerouting power now. He only blew out two power receptors; temporary repairs will be done in eight minutes.\"\n\"The ship will reach its departure point in ten. It's set to autopilot. Fightercraft departing docking bay in thirty seconds.\"\nTamsin got a cold feeling in her stomach. \"Jayse, what are you doing?\"\nShe could hear laughter in his voice. \"Distracting them. Fightercraft departing in twenty seconds.\"\nHer fingers continued to skip over the control panel, giving the computer commands. \"There are five of them. I hadn't realized you were actively suicidal.\"\n\"I was tops in our class, remember?\" he said lightheartedly. He was always euphoric during a launch, or during a fight. \"These guys don't hold a candle to me. Launch in five -- four -- three -- two -- one --\" The ship shuddered slightly as he left the docking bay. \"I'll be back before you hit warp.\"\nTamsin tried to put him out of her mind as she worked to get the power rerouted.\nAdrenalin thrilled through Jaysen's bloodstream as his fighter slipped out into the stars. He looped around the ship and darted above it, looking for his first target. A fighter hovered about two kilometers from the bow of the ship. The shots were coming from that 'craft; the other four were orienting themselves around the ship. As he moved toward the first fighter, which was the most immediate threat to the ship, he tried to place what seemed odd about the way the fighters were moving. He bore down on the first fighter from above at a crazy angle. The fighter didn't move; it just kept firing at the ship. \"Cocky bastard,\" snarled Jaysen as he thumbed the trigger to his lasers. The moment he came into range, he fired twice. The enemy fighter exploded silently, pieces flying in all directions. In his quieter moments, Jaysen was always amazed a life could end so quietly, without fireworks and noise. He pulled up and set his sights on another fighter.\nAs he moved in on the second fighter, he realized what was so odd about the way the fighters were deployed. Rather than ranging all around the ship, they were arrayed on one plane, as if they were fighting on land. \"Idiots!\" he yelled as he saw the ships turn ponderously, trying to find the enemy. Like most military morons, he thought, they had no idea what three-dimensional fighting was like. The second 'craft managed to get off a few shots, all of which fell wide of the mark. He destroyed it quickly, ignoring for now thoughts of the pilot inside, and looped around, noting how the battle had drawn the other three fighters away from the starship.\nThe three fighters began to close around him, trying to surround him. He laughed. \"You're still thinking in two dimensions.\" He pulled up and circled above the fighters, coming down behind them and destroying one before it had the chance to react. He immediately pulled into a steep turn, dodging the last two 'crafts.\nOne was limping. Apparently, the pilot had overstressed the engine. Jaysen discounted him. The other had followed him into the turn. Jaysen executed a series of fast maneuvers, designed to shake off another pilot. Tamsin had enhanced the speed and maneuverability of their fighter, making it a match for any Naridian craft. A tight turn brought Jaysen behind the 'craft, and he fired on it. His shot crippled the fighter, but didn't destroy it. He turned around, moving in for the kill.\nThe other 'craft moved behind him. Jaysen saw it and tried to dodge, turning quickly. As he turned, the fighter fired off a shot that grazed his 'craft.\nThe gravity controls were knocked out by the blast. Pressure inside the fighter reached 7 Gs. Jaysen was still stabbing at the controls as he blacked out.\nTamsin reached the bridge in time to see Jaysen's fighter take the hit. He didn't seem to be severely damaged, but his ship was drifting. \"Jaysen, come in, please respond,\" she barked over the radio. No reply. She linked her computer to the one on Jaysen's fighter, firing shots at the two predator 'craft circling as she did so. When she saw the results, she swore. No gravity in his fighter, but it had briefly shot up to damn near eight Gs. He must have blacked out. She locked her computer in with the fighter's, and began giving it commands to bring it in.\nOne of the enemy fighters got lucky. He fired off a shot that knocked out her external communications unit, and she lost her link to the fighter. She slammed her hand against the console. \"This isn't fair!\"\nNothing to do but try another idea. The two craft were closing in on Jaysen's fighter, preparing to physically link to it and take it back to the planet. Tamsin readied a cable, one they occasionally used to grab asteroids loaded with precious metals. She laid out a string of commands, preparing to use it to drag Jaysen's fighter in. It was a long shot, but worth a try.\nAs she finished the macro, and shot a few more times to dissuade the enemy 'crafts, she heard the engines suddenly roar. Her blood ran cold. \"No...\"\nJaysen had programmed the autopilot perfectly. While she'd been working on getting his fighter back, the ship had drifted to its departure point. She looked up and saw the stars begin to blur. She tried to halt the command, but knew the engines were past the point where they could be stopped.\n\"No!\" she shouted in horror. \"Jaysen!\"\nThe ship went into warp and left the system as the two Naridian fighters closed in on Jaysen's 'craft. Tamsin crumpled into a chair, despairing, finally feeling the pain of her wound, as the beauty of the stars streaked around her.\nInterlude\nJaysen rose out of unconsciousness with great difficulty, fighting through thick waves of blackness. He felt woozy as he opened up his eyes. It took a few seconds for them to focus. When they did, he saw Tamsin sitting at his bedside, engrossed in a book.\n\"Tam?\" he said, his voice harsh and raspy from disuse.\nShe started and looked at him with a smile, putting the book down on his bedtable. \"You're finally awake. I was getting worried.\"\n\"What happened?\" he asked, his memory still foggy. Nothing seemed quite right.\n\"The gravity control on your fighter went haywire. The high Gs knocked you out. When we hauled you in, we found\nthere was a problem with the oxygen mix, too. You're lucky we got you back.\"\n\"How long have I been out?\" asked Jaysen, still disoriented.\n\"About three days.\" She took his hand. \"I was worried about you.\"\nHe reached up the other hand to brush the copper hair out of her face. \"Tam, I...I'm glad you were worried about me.\"\nShe held his hand against her cheek for a moment, with her eyes closed. \"I didn't want to lose you,\" she said. She turned her head slightly and kissed the back of his hand.\nJaysen looked at her, stunned. That gentle kiss was the strongest affection she'd ever expressed toward him. Things were happening too fast. He brushed his free hand against her cheek. \"Tam...\"\n\"I was so afraid I'd lost you,\" she said, as she leaned over and kissed him.\nHe wrapped his arms around a dream come true. He kissed her back and traced her neck with his hand. He moved her shirt, reaching to trace the scar that ran down her shoulder.\nHis fingers found only silky, smooth skin. He pushed her away from him, confused. \"What's wrong, Jaysen?\" she asked, as he turned away from her.\nHis eyes fell on the spine of the book on the bedtable. It was a collection of twenty-third century deconstructivist poems, something Tamsin would never read. He turned back to the woman and searched her face. He could see small differences; she looked too young, almost like Tamsin did her last year in college. Her hair was too short, and her eyes were blue, not green. Her open shirt was askew, and he could see only smooth skin where there should be multiple scars. This wasn't Tamsin.\nShe mistook his look for desire. \"Jaysen, come here,\" she said, reaching toward him.\nHe knocked her arm away, then backhanded her. \"Who the hell are you?\" he yelled as she fell to the floor. She backed into a corner and cowered. If he'd had any doubt about who she was, that proved it. Tamsin would already have torn him apart, especially in his present condition.\nHe kneeled over her and grabbed her by the hair. He wanted to kill her, but he needed information first. \"Who are you? What's going on?\"\nHe suddenly felt an overwhelming wave of dizziness and fell to the floor. All the pieces suddenly came together.\nDrugs. They're giving me drugs.\nHe heard voices in the distance.\n\"What went wrong?\"\n\"I don't know. The stats we have on her must be wrong in some way.\"\n\"We've touched a nerve somehow. We should use her again.\"\nJaysen remembered everything Chas had ever told them about government interrogation. \"Don't think they can't break you, because they will. They'll use anything they can to get a hold on you. Start telling lies right away. That way, when you get to the truth, they won't believe you.\" As he fell back into unconsciousness, he kept repeating in his mind Don't think they can't break you, because they will...\nAnd don't trust Tamsin.

He didn't seem aware of the pain.\"\nLivana arranged Tamsin's unconscious body as comfortably as she could, then ran down to check on the refugees. She was relieved when she found no one had been injured in the extremely rough landing. She directed them up to the galley and rushed to the door. She opened it and saw two men running toward the spaceship with a number of medical personnel trailing behind them. As the two men came to the door, she pulled out a blaster and trained it on them, a cold sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. The danger wasn't at an end yet. She couldn't let them board the ship until she was sure who they were.\n\"Stand and deliver,\" she called to them, then waited breathlessly for their response to the code.\n\"Your money or your life,\" said the shorter one with bronzed skin and curly brown hair. \"We're from Ground Zero.\" He rushed up the stairs and into the ship, the tall, bearded darker one close on his heels. \"I'm Chas El Andar, head of the hospital here. This is Troy Guthridge. Who are you? Where are Tamsin and Jaysen?\"\nLivana rushed along beside them, trotting to keep up with their long legs. \"I'm Livana. I've been helping out on the ship, keeping the refugees organized and trying to get Tamsin to rest. She's extremely ill. She passed out just after the landing. I don't know where Jaysen is.\"\n\"What are Tamsin's symptoms?\" asked Chas, taking the stairs two at a time.\n\"She has an extremely resilient strain of gangrene. I haven't seen it before. It's resistant to the broad-based antibiotics you have on board this ship. I've tried to help the antibodies breed, but I haven't had any luck. If you put me in touch with your chief genetic engineer, we can design an antibody that should put it out of commission.\" Livana gasped out the last few words, out of breath from hoisting her heavy body up the steps even in the relatively light gravity.\n\"You were able to analyze the infection that closely with the instruments we had on board?\" Chas asked skeptically.\n\"No one could do that. It's my Gift; I can link with a patient and view the infecting cells that way.\"\nChas stopped and, for the first time, she felt, really looked at her. \"Doctor Livana Oduvai! I've read your papers on substance-induced tachyocardia!\" He shook her hand quickly, then continued rushing toward the bridge, now within view. \"It's a pleasure to have you here. I hope I can encourage you to join our staff; we're always looking for more medical doctors.\"\nThey reached the top of the stairs and Chas threw open the door. Livana could see one pale, waxy hand hanging from the pilot's chair. Chas tapped his comunit. \"I need a stretcher on the bridge immediately.\" He knelt by her and turned the chair.\nTamsin's face looked like a mask; her skin and lips were the same drained white. She didn't move as Chas lifted one eyelid and shone a small light into her eye. \"Absolutely no reaction. She's sunk into a comatose state.\"\nA nurse leading an antigrav stretcher came to the door. \"Help me get her on there,\" Chas ordered. With Troy's help, Chas and the nurse gently lifted Tamsin onto the stretcher. \"Bring her to the intensive care unit in the quarantine section; start her on amoximyacin immediately. Take her blood and get Kazimir Raudanitis to start immediately on crafting an antibody. She's infected with a new strain of gangrene. I'll be sending someone to assist him in a few minutes. Tell him to use the large lab in the quarantine section. He can bring in any of the techs he wants.\" The nurse nodded and sped down the stairs, maneuvering the antigrav stretcher skillfully. Livana stood against the wall, out of the rush of action.\nTroy tapped his comunit. \"We need Layten or Zach up here immediately to access the computer and get the logs. We have to find out what happened to Jaysen.\"\nChas turned to Livana. \"Where are the rest of the refugees? We need to put them in the quarantine units.\"\n\"I told them to go to the galley. They're waiting for directions.\"\nChas turned to Troy. \"Get those refugees into the quarantine units; I have some doctors there ready to process them.\"\n\"You need to send some guards here, as well,\" Livana said. Chas and Troy looked at her, confused. She straightened her shoulders. \"We have a prisoner down in crew cabin D.\"\nThe man paced like a caged wildcat in the locked cabin. His right arm hung uselessly at his side, the forearm swinging slightly at the midpoint, bone showing through a gap in the skin. He didn't seem aware of the pain.\n\"He attacked Tamsin down in the engine room with a laser cutter. She broke his arm to get it away from him,\" Livana told Chas. \"He destroyed one of the power receptors. Tamsin rerouted the power, but had to continually manually stabilize it to keep the ship going.\"\n\"What else did he do?\" asked Chas.\n\"He brought a transmitter on board with him. After we launched, he broadcast our position. I gather some fighters came after us. I wanted to treat his arm, but every time I came near him, he attacked me.\" She ignored the bile that came up her throat at the memory of him rushing toward her, blood in his eyes.\nChas shook his head. \"I can't believe Tamsin and Jaysen could have such poor judgment! They know as well as anyone else how cautious we have to be.\"\n\"Don't blame them. He was imprisoned by the government and `reeducated'. They embedded a second personality that was triggered when he made arrangements to board the ship. No one could have known. Even his Gifted wife couldn't tell the difference.\"\nThe armed guards came to the door. Chas gestured inside. \"That's the prisoner. We'll have more details about him when we get the details in the ship's log.\"\nThe guards opened the door and the man rushed toward them, attacking. One of the guards stunned him. The guards put their arms under his, and dragged him from the room, head bobbing limply. Livana felt her stomach begin to quiet as Chas escorted her out of the ship. She knew she was on her way to the lab, and she couldn't afford any distractions while she was trying to heal someone.\n\"It's unfortunate,\" Livana said. \"He was a kind man. Not very intelligent, or very driven, but he had a good heart. He was trying to help the Gifteds. He just wasn't clever enough to avoid being caught.\"\nChas nodded. \"It's happened before. We have a great psychiatric staff here; they may be able to help him.\" As he led her across the spaceport and toward the medical facility, he looked at her quizzically. \"How do you know all this about him, anyway?\"\nLivana smiled bleakly. \"He was my husband.\"\nLivana spent most of her twenty-nine hours of required quarantine with Kazimir, the genetic engineer, working to develop an antibody that would keep Tamsin's body from being consumed by the infection, going through the physical parts of the quarantine procedures when she stopped for a bite to eat or to use the bathroom. Even with their non-stop work, it was a near thing. Chas had to cut away the worst of the infected flesh to slow the pace of the invading gangrene, and replace it with an organic bandage that would be absorbed back into the body as Tamsin healed. Once the antibodies began to work, Livana urged the new cells to divide more quickly, speeding the pace of healing. When Tamsin's vital signs had stabilized, Chas brought Livana to the temporary quarters that she and her daughter had been assigned to and told her he'd set up an appointment to discuss her future with the medical center later in the day. As soon as she opened the door, she was assaulted by an excited twelve year old.\n\"Mom, Mom, I'm so glad you're back!\" Olanna said, hugging her excitedly. Her nose wrinkled and she let go quickly. \"Whew, you smell! I was worried about you. I haven't seen you since we got here. They sent one of the nurses to tell me you were OK, but I was still kind of nervous.\"\n\"I'm fine. I was working with the pilot of our ship. She's still very ill, but it looks like she's going to make it. And I think I got a job.\" Livana stood on her toes to kiss her daughter's forehead. Her daughter was already as tall as she was! She looked like her father, with his creamy brown skin, so much paler than Livana's own. Livana shook her head as she hugged her skinny daughter. \"Has Kaori been taking care of you?\"\n\"Kaori's boring, Mom. Kalin let me borrow a primary psychology textbook. It's really neat.\"\nNow that her daughter wasn't wrapped around her neck, she could see a slight figure standing by the window. She wasn't much taller than Olanna or Livana. Her hair fell like ebony silk down to her knees, and her black, tilted eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled at Livana and held out two delicate hands, palm up, in greeting. She radiated serenity. I like this woman, thought Livana immediately. She placed her plump hands, palm down, atop the woman's. \"I'm Kalin,\" said the dark-haired woman. \"I'm with the resettlement group. I came to ask your daughter if she'd like to go to school today. We're having an orientation session for the new children in a few minutes. Would you mind if she went?\"\nLivana turned to her daughter. \"Would you like to go?\"\n\"Of course I want to go! Besides, you'll be sleeping for hours anyway.\" Her daughter was accustomed to the routine of her mother the doctor.\nLivana yawned. \"You're probably right. But isn't it a little late in the day for school to start?\"\n\"You're still spacelagged. It's now seven-forty-five AM,\" said Kalin. She rested a hand on Livana's arm. Livana felt a wave of compassion and -- was it hope? -- spilling through her. \"Get some sleep. I heard what you did for Tamsin. You deserve it.\"\nAfter she kissed Olanna good-bye, Livana curled up on the bed and fell deeply asleep.\nShe woke to the sound of her daughter quietly puttering around the room. She stretched and smiled blearily at the girl. \"Hi, hon. How was school?\"\n\"It was great. They said they'll put me in an accelerated class if you don't mind. They also want to test my Gifts, if you think it's OK.\" Olanna sat down on the edge of the bed.\nLivana stroked her daughter's hair. \"I think that's wonderful. Some of the best teachers are here. I'm glad they'll teach you to use them.\"\nOlanna got up and began straightening her schooldisks, which spilled all over the dresser. \"I checked your v-mail. Chas El-Andar wants to meet with you at five-thirty. Is he the one who wants to give you the job? And Kalin invited us to dinner with some other families at seven, to talk about resettlement. Can I go play with Vasilissa tomorrow after school?\"\nLivana tried to keep track of the questions tumbling over one another. \"Is Vasilissa one of your schoolmates?\" asked Livana, smiling. Back on Narid, no one would ask a Gifted child over to their house to play. Olanna had had a lonely childhood. It looked like that was going to change.\n\"Yeah. I figured you'd be working late.\"\n\"Not if I can help it. I want to spend some time with you.\"\nOlanna, eyes alight as they had never been on Narid, shrugged and smiled. \"I'll keep busy. Did you know Kalin is Dad's doctor?\"\nLivana was used to following her daughter's non-linear conversation, but this comment surprised her. \"She is?\"\n\"Yeah, she's going to try to help Dad get better.\"\n\"How did you know there was something wrong with your Dad?\" How much did her daughter know, anyway?\n\"I found out on the ship. I heard you talking to the pilot about it.\" Livana's heart sank. Her daughter knew everything. Olanna held her hand and smiled at her. \"It's OK, Mom. Kalin told me it's not Dad's fault. I know he didn't want it to happen. If anyone can make him better, Kalin will.\"\nLivana didn't feel much better. While she and her husband had spent most of the past few years separated, and he'd had very little contact with Olanna, her daughter was still at that age where she considered her parents infallible. When he'd told them he would get them off Narid, it had made him a hero in Olanna's eyes. It hurt Livana to know that her daughter had learned what had happened to her father.\n\"Get up, Mom!\" said Olanna loudly, poking her mother and dragging her out of her self-accusatory thoughts. \"It's four-thirty. You'd better get ready for your interview.\" She pulled clothes out of the drawers, then turned back to her mother. \"Go take a shower. You don't want to look like you just got out of bed, do you?\"\nLivana walked to the bathroom, trying to figure out where the day had gone and wondering just when her daughter had decided to become her mother.\n\"The hospital needs a competent administrator, and from all the recommendations I've received from your coworkers who preceded you here, you fit the bill admirably.\" Chas poured her a cup of green tea, which matched the pale green tunic and pants her daughter had selected for her. (\"You're not going to wear that old outfit, are you, Mom? It makes you look pudgy. Wear this instead -- it makes you look more businesslike.\")\nHe blew on his tea to cool it as he continued. Even sitting calmly, Chas seemed to take up the whole room; he was almost bouncing in his chair, anxious to get up and move around. He spoke quickly, the words leaping out of his mouth. \"One of our people -- I'll introduce you to him later -- managed to coax your records from New Boston Hospital. You had some very impressive reviews. It's fairly clear that, without the restrictions put on Gifteds, you would have been titular head of your department by this time, instead of just doing the admin work of one.\"\nThe bronzed man put his cup down and leaned forward. \"Ms. Oduvai, I'd like to offer you the position of Head Administrator at Selene Hospital.\" Livana sat back in surprise. She'd been expecting a position as staff doctor, at best, but nothing like this. \"It's a larger position than you've held before, but I think you have the skills. And, quite frankly, we really need someone with both medical talent and administrative ability in the position. I've been trying to do it, but,\" he made a large gesture, nearly knocking over the teapot, \"I really don't have any talent for it. And I don't have the time, with all my other duties.\" He held up a hand in warning. \"It's not the easiest job. You'll be expected to take on some patients. And we'd also like you to work with our metametric division. They're researching the various Gifts. Your healing ability is one we haven't had a chance to work with before. They'd like to help you develop it.\" He pushed a datapadd at her. Her eyes opened even wider at the yearly figure she'd be paid. \"That includes a month's paid vacation the first year. After the first year, you'll also receive a month's paid sabbatical, although I've never seemed to use mine. You'll find there's not enough hours in the day here on Maris.\"\n\"But isn't that always the case?\" Livana smiled.\nChas waved his hands, sending his cup teetering on the edge of the table. \"I'm not speaking metaphorically. Since you're from Narid, you're used to a 29-hour day. Here, there's only 22 hours in a day.\" Livana blinked in surprise. Now she knew where her day had fled to. \"But there's an advantage; a work day is only 7 hours here. What do you think?\"\nLivana tried to catch her breath. Chas' enthusiasm was infectious, but she had to really think about this offer for a while. \"I have to admit, I'm very surprised by your offer. This wasn't what I was expecting at all. My only concern is...you see, I have a daughter...\"\n\"Olanna is taking an advanced course load, plus beginning metametric courses. She's also signed up for the Young Explorers and the Drama Club.\" He grinned at Livana. \"If I were you, I'd be worried whether my daughter was going to have enough time for me!\"\n\"How do you know all this?\" asked Livana, taken aback.\n\"Your daughter told me when she came to visit this afternoon. She likes it here. She said she wanted to keep busy when you took your new job.\"\n\"She couldn't socialize much in New Boston over the past few years. I guess she's trying to make up for lost time,\" Livana said with a wry smile.\nChas stood. \"Why don't I take you on a tour of the hospital, and while we walk, I'll tell you a little more about life on Maris.\" She left the room at his heels and kept up with his fast walk down the brightly-colored halls. \"Selene Hospital is the primary medical center and research facility on Maris. It's also linked with Ground Zero, the Naridian resettlement project. The colony was established less than a hundred years ago, which is part of the reason we set up a refugee center here. The colony was thrilled to get new people, especially highly skilled ones like many of the Naridian refugees. You'll find no prejudice against Gifteds here.\"\nChas turned left into the patient wing, leaning a bit to the side like a racing aircar in a steep turn. His shoes made a soft hissing sound against the floor. \"I want to take you in to check on our new star patient.\" He stopped at a door and paused for a second. Livana read the patient's name on the door -- T. Donner. Chas threw open the door.\nInside, Livana saw Tamsin, slightly less pale than the white sheets. Her head snapped up guiltily as she withdrew the organic knife she'd been using to dismantle the bed's computer. Livana wondered absently at the mechanism that allowed the blade to slide so smoothly back into her wrist. Pieces of the computer lay all over the brightly colored patchwork quilt spread over her lap. \"Hi Chas. How are you settling in, Livana?\" she asked weakly.\nChas sighed. \"Tam, you did that last time. Don't you think we've caught on by now? That's a dummy computer. We hid the real one.\" Turning to Livana, he said, \"Last time she was here, she realigned the monitoring computer so it would continue to report that she was here and stable while she snuck out of the hospital.\" He turned back to the pale woman in the bed, her hair in a tangled copper halo around her head. \"We've Tamsin-proofed the room, kid. You're not sneaking away this time.\"\n\"Then give me a datapadd or something!\" the redhead snarled. \"I've been stuck here, with nothing to read but a hardcopy book of deconstructionist poetry Kalin gave me. I'd rather be back on intravenous food than eat the stuff that passes for food here. And no one will tell me what's going on! Let me out!\" She pulled a pillow out from behind her and threw it at Chas. It fell uselessly to the floor half a meter short of his feet.\nChas picked up the pillow and fluffed it, then walked over behind the bed and tucked it behind Tamsin's head as she squirmed down under the quilt, pulling it up to her chin, breathing heavily after her outburst. \"If you were well enough to go home, you would have hit me with that pillow. Besides, knowing you, you'll find a way to use the datapadd to help you get out of here.\"\n\"Just tell me one thing, and I swear I'll be the perfect patient,\" Tamsin said defiantly.\n\"What do you want to know?\" asked Chas.\nTamsin suddenly looked vulnerable and very scared, burrowed almost completely under the big patchwork quilt. \"What happened to Jaysen?\"\nLivana's stomach twisted. Kasimir, the tech who'd helped her create the antibody, had told her a lot about Tamsin and Jaysen. If half the stories of their exploits were true, they deserved great respect. He described the two as being almost one person in two bodies, so deeply were their souls intertwined. It wasn't just Tamsin's body that was injured near Narid. She seemed bereft, torn apart without her other half. When Livana saw people like this, she felt almost relieved she'd never bonded with anyone, not even her husband, so strongly.\nChas sighed and patted Tamsin's shoulder. \"We still don't know. As soon as we find out, I'll come right down here and tell you.\"\nTamsin's jade eyes were hollow and dark. \"If they caught him -- Chas, I don't know if Kalin ever told you what happened to her in there. I remember what she looked like. I brought her back to Maris.\"\n\"I've read the records,\" Chas said. \"Try not to think about it, Tamsin. You can't do anything from a hospital bed. Now, will you please get some rest? I'm going down to Layten's office right now. I'm as worried as you are.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Stop dismantling our equipment, will you?\"\nLivana slipped out of the room behind Chas. \"What happened to Kalin?\"\n\"You remember when the medical center outside New Boston blew up?\"\nLivana could still smell the charred flesh. \"We received a few of the corpses at the hospital. They never had a chance.\"\nChas looked grim. \"Don't feel too bad for them. I don't know all the details. I was in transit when everything happened. I think there are some things they didn't put in the report.\" He swallowed and continued, speaking distantly and clinically. \"Kalin was methodically tortured. They found some interesting ways to stimulate the nerve endings. There are areas on her skin that will never have sensation again. The nerves were burnt out entirely, and we have no way to replace them, at least not now. They used cruder methods, too -- they pulled all her nails out by the roots, crushed the bones in her feet -- it's amazing that she was ever able to walk again.\"\n\"But -- that was a medical center! I used to refer some of my patients there! I'd tried to get a job there because they were known for their innovative techniques. I can't believe --\"\nChas cut her off with a chopping motion. \"There's a reason they had those innovative techniques. The doctors there felt progression of their research outweighed any ethical questions. They had a lot of subjects to test on, all the prisoners who were difficult to break. We still haven't seen all the fallout from the experiments done on the people who were kept there --\\x11it'll be years before all the problems come to light.\" He pressed his lips together.\nLivana could see him going over the records of the patients in his mind and could only imagine the horrors he found there. Torture, experiments -- those were all things she only read about or watched in the latest adventure sagas. She knew, in some part of her mind, that it had happened, but she couldn't quite grasp it. Kalin was so calm, so serene; how could she have been through all that and come out intact?\n\"Anyway, here's our destination -- the computer facility.\" He led her into a dim room with a number of holos playing near all the walls. Two men sat in the center of the room. One with black hair pulled back in a ponytail, high cheekbones, a dark beard, and bright blue, tilted eyes was tapping away on a datapadd; the other, slumped slightly, wan, and disheveled-looking, had his eyes closed. Livana looked at the largest holo to see Tamsin, weary and pale, in her ship's uniform. \"I've lost Jaysen. I believe he's been captured. We were sabotaged shortly after taking off. Jaysen was boarded while defending the ship so it could go into warp and depart the system. In case I don't make it to Maris, I want it known that I take full responsibility for what has happened here...\"\nThe man with the datapadd paused the image and turned to Chas. \"I've been going through the logs again to see if I can get any more information. No luck so far. Layten's been trying to access some systems on Narid.\"\nThe other man shifted in his seat and began to sit up, tucking his long, dark skirt around his legs. Livana noticed that, even when alert, Layten looked like he was trying to blend in with the couch he was sitting on.\n\"I'm glad to see you're back. I thought you might have gotten trapped in a subroutine,\" said the first man.\n\"You try getting results from a program when there's an eight-hour time lag between you and the computer you're working on. It's not easy,\" Layten said, stretching. Livana could hear his back crack.\n\"I forgot. Introductions.\" Chas ran his hands through his hair. \"This is Livana Oduvai; she's going to be head of admin at Selene Hospital. Livana, this is Zach Shima and Layten Kaige. They run the systems for the hospital and for Ground Zero. Layten,\" he said, turning to the man still rubbing his eyes, \"did you find out what happened to Jaysen?\"\n\"It wasn't easy,\" said Layten. \"I sent a search command through most of the databanks. No luck. I think that hardly anyone even knows they have him.\"\n\"You're saying that they do have him, then?\" Chas asked excitedly.\n\"The files were encoded. I just cracked them now.\" He gestured at the large holo and the frozen log shot of Tamsin was replaced by text broken up by an occasional graph or picture. \"These are the records of the Killian Research Facility. They're holding many prisoners there. Total records,\" he shut his eyes for a minute, then opened them again, \"ninety-four. These people are considered the most dangerous to the government. They're now being used as lab rats for new reeducation techniques. The idea, apparently, is to break them and then get them working for the government. It's a refined version of what they did to Kalin.\"\nLivana could hear the disgust in his voice. She bit her lip and wrapped her arms tightly around herself. She'd only seen the quicksilver man who'd helped her get off-planet once, but that image, as he helped her into the ship with a quick grin, whispering words of encouragement, had flashed before her whenever anyone mentioned him. She couldn't imagine him being tortured.\nThen she realized she could and felt even sicker.\nLayten continued grimly. \"I also accessed the records of former detainees. Seems they're more successful at killing them than reeducating them.\"\n\"What else have you got?\" asked Chas.\nLayten blinked again, and the text changed to a three-dimensional map of the building. \"This shows the various rooms in the facility. Cross-matching.\" He closed his eyes. Livana realized, with a shock, that he was mentally connected with the computer. She'd heard of people who had cortical implants allowing them to link with computer systems, but she had never actually seen one. Most people didn't like to get that close to their machines. Names began popping up in the rooms on the screen. \"Jaysen's being held here.\" Layten put his finger in the center of the holo, pointing at a room at the bottom floor in the center of the building. \"Except for the top two floors, which house the workers at the facility, this building is completely underground.\"\n\"Any chance you can take down their system?\" Zach asked.\n\"Put me on Maris, with a five millisecond lag between me and their computer, and I might be able to do it. But from here -- impossible. Too many things change too quickly. I'm not even sure I could dredge any more information from their system.\"\n\"Can you make sure Tamsin knows about this?\" Chas asked him.\n\"I told Kalin as soon as I knew. She's breaking it to Tamsin now.\"\n\"We need to bring it up in the Council meeting on Wednesday,\" said Zach, \"even if we can't do anything. Do you think Tamsin will be well enough to attend?\"\n\"Do you think I could keep her from leaving her bed?\" said Chas, laughter behind his quick, staccato speech. \"She's only been conscious twelve hours, and I already caught her trying to dismantle the computer in her room. I don't think I'll be able to keep her here past tomorrow night.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Look, Livana's got a dinner appointment in a few minutes, and I want to try to finish this tour. We'll talk about this later, okay?\"\n\"It was nice meeting you two,\" said Livana over her shoulder, rushing out of the room on Chas' heels.\n\"I'd like to show you the metametric research facility,\" said Chas, speeding down the corridor. Livana had to nearly run to keep up with him. The first thing she was going to do as administrator, she decided, would be to get Chas to slow down. \"No one's really done the research full-time on the Gifts the way we have here. We've conclusively proved that metametric ability is the result of mutations caused by prolonged low-level radiation exposure in the first two hundred years of spaceflight. The mutations just exacerbated a latent ability humans already had to one extent or another. We found records dating back to three hundred years before commercial spaceflight that showed humans had these abilities. Unfortunately, most of them were put under psychiatric care because they heard `voices'. No one realized they were picking up other people's thoughts. And no one could teach them how to shut them out. When a telepath can't learn shielding, they tend to go mad.\" The corridor they turned into was crafted out of polished stone, with round windows. A waterfall trickled in an alcove in one wall. The click of Livana's heels echoed off the walls.\n\"But how do you explain all these new talents that are cropping up?\" asked Livana.\n\"Once again, we go back into archaic records. For instance, your talent is one that pops up repeatedly in religious chronicles. The founders of a number of Terran religions, for instance, were said to be able to heal by simply touching a person. Skeptics thought that the people who were healed simply had psychosomatic illnesses, but some of these healers had amazing track records. One man, named Cayce, had hundreds of tomes that kept records on the many people he'd healed. And you, of course, are living proof. We're hoping that, through you, we can learn how to develop those skills and teach other people with that talent how to use it.\"\n\"There's one thing you haven't told me. How did Kalin and all the rest get out?\" They entered an large atrium which was decorated like an old-fashioned Zen garden. They stepped on the stone path between the plants and walked toward the bridge over the free-form pond in the center of the room. It had an air of tranquillity to it. The atmosphere even seemed to affect Chas -- his steps slowed, as did his speech.\nLivana watched him stare into the water, chewing his lip, his bright, flowered shirt looking completely out of place in the staid garden. \"You probably read the reports. There was an accident with some flammable chemicals being stored at the site. Tamsin and Jaysen were near there when the firestorm happened. They'd been trying to figure out a way to get her out. When they got to the site, they found the prisoners picking their way out between the bodies. Kalin and all the other subjects there escaped unscathed.\" He paused and grimaced. \"Well, no more damaged than they were before the fire, anyway.\"\n\"But that's impossible!\" Livana said, shaking her head, remembering the giant fireball she'd seen from miles away.\n\"It happened. But we won't know why until we can get into Layten's head to find out how he did it.\"\n\"You mean he...\"\n\"Kalin's husband is a firestarter. He has no control over his talent. He's only used it in times of crisis. In fact, no one knew he was Gifted until the one time he used it, when those chemicals ignited. He says he doesn't know how he did it. He may have a memory block.\"\n\"He knew what happened to Kalin?\" She'd heard Gifted people shared a mental bond, though she herself had never experienced it.\nChas nodded, pulling leaves off the elm tree by the bridge and tearing them apart. \"And we still don't have any more details. That's one mutation that I'm sure has plenty of military uses.\"\nLivana folded her arms and stared down at the worn, purplish wooden planking of the bridge. \"Layten said they're using a refined version of the techniques used on Kalin.\"\n\"Yeah.\" Chas was leaning against the railing, head in his hands.\n\"Do you think we can get Jaysen out?\" Livana felt a responsibility to the people of Ground Zero. They'd rescued her, and she'd do nearly anything to keep them from harm.\nChas looked at her, dark eyes hollow as Tamsin's had been earlier. \"If we can't, I hope he dies quickly.\"\nTamsin studied the perfectly smooth, glassy water in the kilometer-long reflecting pool, the just-rising tiny white sun chasing the surface with a thin coat of silver. She looked to her left, to her right, and then, cautiously over her shoulder to the shadowed arches of the hospital. She was alone in the spacious courtyard. She tossed the coins in her hand, then took one, placing the rest in her pocket. She crooked her finger around the silver disk, then glanced again around the courtyard. She saw no one. She tossed the coin precisely at the pool. It bounced off the glassy surface, once, then twice. As it skipped, the distance of the hops got shorter and shorter. After twenty-six hops, it sank to the bottom of the pool.\n\"So, this is where you are every morning,\" said a mellow contralto to Tamsin's right.\nTamsin jumped and, by reflex, began to crouch in an attack position facing the voice. She saw the rose lips curling in a gentle smile and sighed, dropping back into a more normal stance. \"I really hate it when you do that.\"\nKalin looked out at the water, the small ripples caused by the recent disturbance quickly stilling, and then back at Tamsin, glossy jet hair slipping over her shoulder. \"How did you do that? There aren't any pebbles anywhere around here.\"\nTamsin took her left hand out of her pocket, clenched in a fist. She opened it toward Kalin, showing her the three copper and one silver disk that lay there. \"My one inheritance from my mother. Thirty-eight cents.\"\nKalin inhaled sharply, then breathed out in a low whistle. \"Thirty-eight cents? You could buy some planets with that! Those should be in a museum. I'm surprised you're throwing such valuable artifacts in this pool. Did you ever try to sell them?\"\n\"Yeah,\" shrugged Tamsin. She took one copper disk, shoved the rest back in her pocket, and tossed it at the pool. Twelve skips. She grimaced. Kalin had disturbed her concentration. \"They're counterfeit.\" Kalin's mouth pursed in a silent \"oh.\" Tamsin smiled with some bitterness. \"They skip well, though.\"\nKalin stared out at the water. Tamsin sent another disk skimming across. Patter patter patter plop. She turned and stared at Kalin, waiting for her to break the silence. Kalin just stared at the water, calmly. After a minute, Tamsin said angrily, \"Look, did you come out here to talk to me, or what?\"\nKalin turned to her smoothly. \"I didn't want to disturb you while you were entertaining yourself.\"\n\"You've already done that. I probably won't get one skip out of the rest of these.\" She balanced on one leg, tugging the boot off her other foot.\n\"I wanted to talk to you about Jaysen,\" said Kalin.\nTamsin ripped the boot off her other foot, tugged off her socks, then shoved her pants above her heavily muscled calves. \"I'm going after him.\"\n\"Are you sure that's a good idea?\" Kalin asked.\nTamsin waded into the pool, the water splashing around her legs as she went to pick up the first coin. \"It's the only thing I can do. I can't leave him there.\"\n\"You're not in good health right now,\" Kalin said calmly. Tamsin began to feel a pressure, slight but growing, in her head. \"Do you think you could slip in there in your condition?\"\nTamsin was furious. \"It doesn't matter what my condition is! I won't leave him in there!\" She kicked violently, sending water everywhere. \"And will you stop doing that! Scheiss'n projecting empath -- it drives me crazy!\"\n\"Scheiss'n?\" asked Kalin, one eyebrow raised.\nTamsin shrugged. \"Sorry. It's Staatsprache.\" Even now, whenever she got angry, she slipped into the rough city language she'd grown up speaking. Considering who was in control of the government now, it might become Narid's planetary language in a few years. \"You wouldn't want to know.\"\nKalin smiled apologetically. \"I was just trying to calm you down a little. It feels like you're about to attack someone. But I've never been able to do that with you. Your shields are impressive. You're sure you're not Gifted?\"\nTamsin wanted to hit something, but there was only water. \"I'm not Gifted! I hate that word! Damn it, that's the whole root of the problem.\"\n\"I don't understand.\"\nTamsin's smile was sharp and brittle. \"Of course. You have no idea what the word Gift means in Staatsprache, do you?\" Kalin shook her head. \"It means poison. Where I come from, you wouldn't dare admit you had the talent, even before the new government came in. It's considered,\" she thought for a second for the best word, \"unclean. And dangerous. Even the word, Gifted.\" Her stress on it was slightly different, the i becoming nearly an e, the d becoming a soft sh. \"How can you think it's a good thing when it sounds like it's poisonous?\"\nKalin's brow wrinkled. \"Goddess, you're serious, aren't you?\"\nTamsin picked up the last coin and stepped onto the blue brick, trailing dark stains of water. \"And that's why Jaysen is where he is now. Sometimes I think both of us would have been better off staying in Tiburon.\" Her mother had hoped she'd stay; she'd been too old for her work and had wanted to support herself by selling Tamsin's body instead. But she'd stayed in school, right next to Jaysen, if only to keep him from being killed by some of the gang members he'd offended.\n\"You both would have been dead by now.\"\n\"I rest my case.\" Tamsin picked up her boots and walked across the courtyard toward her quarters. \"There's no way you can change my mind. I'm responsible for him, and I won't leave him behind.\" Her boots slapped against the edge of the arch as she stepped under it, out of the sun. \"Remember when you were a prisoner? Did you think we'd leave you behind?\"\n\"Yes.\" Tamsin turned, shocked to Kalin, a dark, delicate figure silhouetted by the light streaming through one of the arches. \"I never thought anyone would get me out. I thought if you didn't, then you'd be safe.\"\nTamsin leaned a shoulder against the cool stone wall and gritted her teeth. She'd never cried in front of anyone, and she wasn't about to start now. \"You thought we'd leave you there? You thought we'd let you die?\" She heard her voice break and shut her eyes, trying to clamp down. She would not, would not, think of Jaysen, trapped in despair.\nShe felt Kalin put an arm around her waist, felt the weight of her delicate head against a shoulder. \"Tamsin, you got me out. But look at Layten. I know his nightmares. I feel them every night when he sleeps beside me. The four of us nearly didn't get away. Are you willing to take the risk again and have it go the other way?\"\nTamsin buried her face in her friend's obsidian hair and pulled her a little closer, trying to block away the dark hole filling her chest. \"I have to. I can't let him die.\"\nKalin paused for a moment before the doors to Tamsin's quarters. Layten stood behind her, a cool rock, providing support mentally as well as physically. Kalin took a deep breath and knocked on the door.\n\"What do you want?\" came the hostile voice from the other side as the door opened. Tamsin was curled up on a chair, copper hair pulled back, black clothes making her look terribly pale as she tapped away at a computer console.\nKalin placed a datapadd on the desk. \"Here's a list of what we'll need.\"\nTamsin looked up at her blankly. \"Need? I don't follow you.\"\n\"Supplies. To rescue Jaysen.\" Tamsin's mouth opened, but she didn't say anything, just stared. Kalin smiled slightly, the only hint she'd give of the laughter bubbling inside. She'd always wanted to strike Tamsin speechless. \"You didn't think I'd let you go alone, did you?\"\nLayten slipped an arm around her waist. I'm going, too.\nShe gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. Of course. Did you think I'd leave you behind? She spoke aloud again. \"There's supplies for three there. Night goggles, food, camouflage clothing,\" she shrugged, \"big guns...\"\n\"But I haven't even talked to Manda yet,\" Tamsin said, shaking her head.\n\"We did,\" said Kalin. \"She understands what you want to do. She figures she'll tell the rest of the Council after we leave. That way, they won't be able to protest.\"\nTamsin snorted as she scanned the list on the padd. \"Sounds like our dear chair is going to get herself into some pretty hot water.\"\n\"It wouldn't be the first time,\" rumbled Layten's deep voice.\n\"You're going to need to add supplies for one more person. Chas is coming,\" Tamsin said.\n\"Chas is a doctor. He's got no combat training. Do you really think he's appropriate?\" Layten asked.\n\"And what do you think we're going to do when we get Jaysen out?\" snapped Tamsin, looking up at him. \"Bring him to Arcadia Hospital and say `Hi, our friend's been tortured, can you patch him up'? Not bloody likely. Besides,\" she continued, looking back at the padd, \"he insisted. I couldn't talk him out of it.\"\nKalin sat down on the sofa. Layten stood against the door, hands clasped behind his back. Tamsin's sparking green eyes shifted back and forth, from one to the other. \"So. We have four people against about sixty guards. I love an even fight,\" she said sarcastically. She propped one foot up on her desk, drumming her fingers against her knee. \"I have an idea on how to get in there. Layten, do you think you could crash their system?\"\nWhenever Layten accessed the computer, Kalin could hear it whirring in the back of her head like it was part of her brain as well. \"I can, but not for long. It's got an automatic reset mechanism.\"\n\"That's fine,\" said Tamsin. \"This is going to be a quick in and out operation, nothing fancy. Our only objective is to get Jaysen out.\"\n\"What about the others?\" asked Layten.\n\"If we have time. I don't want to be callous, but there's only so much we can do.\" She leaned forward and stabbed a button on the console. A three dimensional line drawing of the complex filled the center of the room. The room where Jaysen was being held was tinted gold. \"Here's what we're going to do.\"\nInterlude Two\nJaysen curled up on the hard pallet that passed for a bed, staring at the gray walls in his perennially twilit cell, rubbing his face as the last traces of the drug left him. The interrogation sessions came as irregularly as the food. He didn't even have any facial hair to tell him how long he'd been there; he'd had it suppressed months ago so he wouldn't have to shave. He smiled slightly. If only he'd wanted a beard, like Zach.\nHe pictured his friend, safe on Maris, remembering the last time he'd been there. Two days before the mission, he'd gone boating with Zach and Tamsin. He could almost smell the salt, and see Tamsin leaning over the prow of the boat, her copper hair hanging loose over the water. He smiled, remembering how he'd pushed her over the side, and how she'd quickly pulled him in after her, completely ruining his new silk velvet shirt. He hadn't minded; the ensuing water fight had been too much fun. If Zach hadn't been there, maybe he would have had a chance...\nThe gray walls loomed high, and his throat closed. He knew he'd never survive to see her again. Oh, Tam, he thought, then whispered to the air, \"There was so much I wanted to tell you.\"\nHe turned his face into the corner and tried to sleep, using the meditation techniques Kalin had taught him. But sleep wouldn't come. He kept seeing Tamsin's green flashing eyes, smelling her, hearing her voice.\nA hand touched his shoulder. He sat up in shock, instinctively grabbing the wrist and pulling on it to unbalance his attacker. The legs before him shifted only slightly, and he heard a soft snort. \"I'm glad you remembered something from your physical combat classes.\"\nHe looked up to see sharp green eyes smiling slightly at him, a red braid slithering over one gray-suited shoulder. \"Tam!\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing here?\"\nShe pulled him to a standing position. \"Did you think I could leave you in here? I had to rescue you.\" She stopped and stared at him quite closely. \"Answer me one question,\" she asked him. \"Who did you take to our final-year semiformal at University?\"\n\"I didn't go. I was supposed to take you, but you were busy slogging through the jungle at the time,\" he said. Somewhere, a voice inside him whispered, Don't trust Tamsin. \"Why are you asking me?\"\nShe bit her lower lip and looked down a moment. \"I had to make sure it was you,\" she said. She turned to lead him out of the cell, but not before he caught the worried look in her eyes. \"This has all been too easy. I think there must be a trap hidden somewhere.\" She looked up the corridor, then down. \"Coast is clear. Our distraction must have worked. Come on!\"\nHe followed her as softly as he could down the corridor. Voices came from around a corner, speaking in that peculiar Western drawl so familiar from his childhood. She flattened herself against the wall as she peered around a corner. He saw her fists clench spasmodically as she turned back to him. \"Someone's coming.\" She pulled him to a door, then tapped a quick code on the lock next to it. The door opened and she pulled him in, then slapped a panel beside the inner door to close and lock it.\n\"We're safe for now,\" she sighed, then slapped on the bright lights. Jaysen found himself standing at the center of an interrogation room, and his stomach flipped as it brought back vague memories of questioning. He looked back to his friend for support as a voice inside said, Don't trust Tamsin. She was leaning against the door, arms folded, looking at him with a curiously cold smile. \"Something bothering you, Jaysen?\"\n\"How'd you get the code for the door?\" Don't trust Tamsin don't trust Tamsin DON'T TRUST TAMSIN.\nShe shrugged. \"One of the techs gave it to me.\"\nHe walked closer to her. \"Which one?\"\n\"There are so many,\" she said, waving a hand and walking toward the table in the middle of the room.\nThe voice inside him screamed. He clenched a fist, fighting an almost overwhelming urge to hit her and grabbed her by the hair, to yank her back. Something was wrong, very wrong. \"There are only two.\"\nVery quickly, Tamsin turned around, wrenching her hair out of his grasp and grabbed his wrist. With a quick, bone-wrenching twist, she pivoted, moving his arm behind his back and forcing him, face-first, against a cold wall.\nHe could feel her body press against his and her hot, moist breath against his ear. \"You should know better than to try that on me, Jaysen,\" she whispered, her free hand tracing down his thigh, her voice like a shard of glass. He shivered. \"I've always been better at hand-to-hand than you.\"\nHe felt a jolt of pain as his wrist was pulled higher, almost above his shoulder blades. A tongue quickly flicked on his earlobe, his throat. He began shaking and couldn't stop.\nThe hot mouth moved away from his throat and he felt cold metal slide along it. It moved up to his cheek. He looked down, out of the corner of his eye, afraid to move any more, and saw a silver blade trace along, felt the flat of it stroke around and back along his skin to the nape of his neck. He wanted to laugh, or to cry. It wasn't Tamsin. She never used a metal knife, not when the two organic blades in her wrists served her so well. He tried to take a deep breath and couldn't. \"What do you want from me?\"\nHer damp, warm voice whispered in his ear again. \"Only the answers to a few questions.\" He heard tearing cloth as the knife traced down his spine, felt the salty trickle of a few drops of blood following it. His wrist was released as she cut his clothes off, but he didn't dare move, feeling burning where the blade cut him, on his arms, then again across his back and down, knowing even the slightest shift could mean worse damage. Her fingers gently traced the cuts, rubbing wet slick blood into his back, his buttocks, his thighs. He felt the tickle of her tongue again on his ear as he tried to lose himself in the pain and ignore her fingers, and the knife. \"There's no reason I can't have fun while I ask,\" the voice laughed, as the knife traced down his spine, then lower.\nJaysen lay balled up, shuddering, in a corner of his cell. He felt filthy; his skin crawled and his mind wouldn't stop screaming, replaying the hours in the torture chamber. He could feel her hands all over him, and the ever-present knife. He knew he'd heal soon. He knew she'd be back again. And he knew, however much he wished for it, she wouldn't kill him.\nNicole Gustas (ngustas@hamp.hampshire.edu) recently gave up working 80 hour weeks in favor of following Duran Duran around the East Coast.

She wrapped one hand around the corporal's mouth, and with the Nicole Gustas other pressed on the woman's throat to cut the flow of blood through the carotid artery.\nTamsin and Kalin squatted in the bushes near the gates of the Killian Research Facility. As Tamsin pulled on her black gloves and adjusted the hood of her black jumpsuit, tucking her copper hair into it to make sure it wouldn't give her away, she was thankful for the Naridian love of shrubbery and ornamentation.\nKalin touched Tamsin's knee and counted under her breath. \"Five, four, three, two, one.\" As they watched, the gate of the facility opened slightly, then the lights flickered and went out. The compound soon came into focus for the two women, who had used eyedrops that briefly increased their ability to see in the dark. Tamsin crept into the guard booth and grabbed the soldier on duty from behind. She wrapped one hand around the corporal's mouth, and with the other, pressed on the woman's throat to cut the flow of blood through the carotid artery. In a few seconds, the woman passed out, and Tamsin stuffed her behind the bushes, trussed with a gag stuffed in her mouth.\nShe quietly ran up to Kalin, who was almost at the entrance to the research facility. \"We have thirteen minutes,\" Kalin subvocalized. They were both wearing throatmikes and earphones so they could speak to each other without anyone overhearing.\n\"I know. I took too long. But I don't want to kill anyone if I don't have to,\" said Tamsin just before she slipped inside the open double doors. She spun as she entered and kicked the guard waiting behind the door in the stomach, then grabbed his gun and cracked him on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious before he had a chance to cry out. She waved Kalin inside. \"Remember to thank Layten for opening all the doors for us.\"\n\"I already have,\" said Kalin. \"Take a right, here.\" They jogged down the hall silently, Kalin leading the way. The faint emergency lighting gave an eerie glow to the halls. They took another right, then jogged down a flight of stairs. Kalin flattened herself against a wall, and Tamsin followed suit. They listened to the voice around the corner. \"Wir muss'n wirschaff hab'n,\" he shouted into a wrist communicator, in Staatsprache.\nTamsin translated for Kalin. \"He's trying to find out what's wrong with the power. He's alarmed. He says all the doors are open.\"\n\"Well, all the prisoners are being held two floors below,\" said Kalin. \"It's only a matter of time before they realize what's going on and come up here.\"\nThey continued down several flights of stairs and entered the corridor. Tamsin skidded on the floor and nearly fell. She smelled the coppery scent of blood. She turned and saw Kalin squatting near the body, now a bloody, unrecognizable mass inside a uniform. \"Looks like they're out,\" Kalin said grimly. \"Come on ... Jaysen's this way.\"\nThey ran quickly down the eerily deserted halls, turning left, then right, then left again. Tamsin picked up the lead as they neared Jaysen's cell, skidding inside seconds ahead of Kalin.\nShe could see him clearly. He was gaunt and pale, curled up asleep on his side in a corner of the cell, wearing nothing. Tamsin knelt beside him and shook him. \"Jaysen, wake up! We've come to get you out.\"\nHe sat up and backed further into the corner. She could see him shaking. \"Get away from me. Don't touch me.\" His voice was filled with loathing.\n\"Jayce, it's me, Tamsin.\" She reached toward him and he shrank back. What was wrong with him? Her stomach clenched tightly. \"Come on. We have to hurry.\"\nShe watched his hands clench into fists. \"You'll have to drag me out of here. I'm not walking willingly into your trap.\"\nTamsin stared at him in consternation for a moment, then heard movement. She and Jaysen turned as Kalin came through the door. \"Hurry up! We only have nine minutes left.\"\n\"Kalin?\" Jaysen said, startled. He stood up hesitantly, wincing.\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Tamsin, reaching to help him. He twitched away from her and nearly fell.\n\"No, I'm fine, just sore. Just get me out of here,\" he said.\nTamsin could see him pale as he began to move, but was afraid to try to touch him again. \"I'll take point and clear out anyone in your path. Kalin, stay with Jaysen.\" Kalin pulled a dark shirt and pants out of her shouldersac and quickly handed them to Jaysen.\nShe hurried down the hall and paused. Kalin and Jaysen followed soon after, Jaysen now clad in black from neck to toe. Tamsin waved them around the corner. The dim halls were frighteningly quiet. She jogged up the stairs and slammed through the doors at the top of the landing, to find a gun pointed straight at her head.\nTamsin stared at the face behind the muzzle of the gun as a delicate white hand ripped the throatmike off her neck. She shuddered as she looked into her own green eyes.\n\"So,\" said her twin holding the gun, dropping the throatmike to the ground and crushing it under her heel. \"You're the illustrious Tamsin.\"\nKalin put one arm around Jaysen's waist, supporting him as he limped down the hall. She let her consciousness drift lightly across the surface of his mind, with a feathery, nearly invisible touch, testing the walls that normally held him together. It was like skipping across a broken bridge after a bad earthquake; she could feel holes and gaps, with Jaysen's strong force of will barely holding it all together. She felt the surface shiver and begin to fall.\nHer light touch became an iron grip as she threw up her own wall around his, shoring up his disintegrating protection in an attempt to keep him from complete collapse. He was stable on the surface, but she could feel the fierce storm roiling beneath, and knew she had only bought him time. She also knew her control was being bought at a high future cost to him, but knew she couldn't get him out if not under his own power. She did a quick check on his physical injuries and was relieved to find they weren't as bad as his mental damages.\nShe looked up at him and he gave her a weak, shaky smile. \"Thanks,\" he said.\n\"Don't say that until we get you out of here,\" Kalin said, as they walked toward the stairs. She watched Tamsin barrel through the doors at the top of the stairs, and could feel some of the tension in Jaysen's mind ease as she left his field of vision. She couldn't quite grasp the tangled, contradictory emotions his copper-haired friend inspired, but knew Tamsin was a flashpoint that should, for now, be avoided in discussion. \"I think you're going to be spending a lot of time with me after we get out.\"\n\"I'm supposed to object at the prospect of spending a lot of time with a beautiful woman?\" asked Jaysen, with his former flirtatious humor. From inside his mind, she could feel how forced it was.\n\"I'm afraid I'll be sharing you with Chas,\" she said, keeping up the illusion. She narrowed her eyes at the doors and pulled Jaysen to a stop at the bottom of the stairs as she listened to the empty hiss in her ear where Tamsin's voice should have been. She quickly switched to mental speech. Wait. We need to take another route.\nWhy? asked Jaysen. It was more of a feeling than the word; Jaysen had never mastered the art of speaking mind-to-mind.\nTamsin should have waved us through by now. She must have walked into a trap. She felt waves of concern from him, but didn't bother to spend the energy to soothe them as they walked in another direction. She looked at her wrist. They had seven minutes.\nTamsin looked desperately for an opening, knowing that every second she waited gave the woman standing across from her an advantage. She watched her own face break into an icy smile. \"Here for Jaysen, are you?\" asked the woman.\nImmediately Tamsin knew what had been going on, knew why Jaysen had reacted with such hatred for her. \"I tried. He refused to leave with me. I had to leave him behind,\" she lied, as she tried to adopt a defeated pose. She tasted bile at the back of her throat, and tried to control and channel her fury.\n\"Now he won't be the only one stuck here,\" said her counterpart. \"Up against the wall; I want to check you for weapons.\"\nTamsin stood spreadeagled against the wall, hands above her head. She heard the rustle of fabric as the woman stuck the gun into a holster. Tamsin held her breath steady and waited. Not yet, not yet\u00c9don't give anything away\u00c9\nHer flesh crawled as she felt the woman's hands pat her down, starting at her collar. The hands moved down, toward her waist. Not yet\u00c9\nAn explosion quietly echoed down the corridor from the distance. She felt the woman behind her start slightly, and took her chance. Tamsin pushed off from the wall as much as she could manage and twisted as she kicked out with her right leg. She felt her foot connect with something solid, and heard a crunch as she began falling. Time began to slow with the adrenaline rush.\n\"A fall does not have to be a bad thing,\" her combat instructor had told her, \"as long as you know where you will land, and your enemy does not.\" As she began to fall, she snapped her right wrist back. The blade shot out, and she felt it score. As she fell to the floor, she saw the cut across the other woman's face, and saw drops of blood spatter. The woman was falling; the kick had landed on one of her knees. Tamsin pulled her knees toward her chest and used the momentum of her fall to roll backward over her right shoulder. She sprang up as her feet touched the floor.\nHer double had fallen to her hands and knees and looked up at Tamsin through blood and copper hair. \"They forgot to tell us about the knives,\" she said. She tried to push herself up, but fell as the right knee gave out. Tamsin saw her reach for the gun and kicked her in the head. The blow cracked her counterpart's skull against the wall and she fell, unconscious. Tamsin stripped off the woman's gun and holster and quickly strapped them onto her leg. She began running down the corridor as she looked at her chrono.\nShe had five minutes.\nKalin and Jaysen had climbed to the top of the staircase. For security reasons, no staircase went all the way up or down the complex, and now, Kalin remembered, they had to cross several corridors before they would reach a stairway which would take them to the entrance. She tried to reach out and feel whether anyone was in the corridor, but her mind was too involved in holding Jaysen together and finding their way out to be able to take on another task. All she felt was a wash of many people's emotions ... mostly anger and fear. Many of the sensations were highly controlled, the feeling of a well-trained Gifted mind. She pushed open the door slightly, hoping to peer out and see whether anyone was in the corridor before they crossed. The door handle was suddenly ripped from her grasp as the door was flung open, and a gun was aimed at her head.\nThe gun muzzle dropped as soon as the short woman behind it saw she wasn't wearing a uniform. Kalin looked around at the crowd of people, some armed, dressed in light blue cotton ... the garb of a patient.\nOr, in these strange times, of a prisoner.\nNext to the woman with the gun, a man with red hair and a mustache stepped forward. \"You're not one of us,\" he said. \"Have you come to get us out?\"\nA wave of helplessness washed over Kalin. Jaysen felt it and squeezed her shoulder. She took a deep breath. \"We don't have enough people to get you out. But we can help you take over this place.\"\n\"How?\" exclaimed the man as the fifteen or twenty people behind him murmured in surprise.\n\"There's a central control room one floor up. From there you can control the power, the doors, the lights, the intruder control systems, everything. And the armory's right next to it.\" The map of the building had been burned into Kalin's mind. \"But we'll have to move quickly. The power comes on in ...\" she looked at her chrono and winced ...\"five minutes, and when it does, you'll lose your only advantage.\"\nThe woman with the gun, curly blond hair cropped short, stared at her with hard blue eyes. \"How do we know we can trust you?\"\nKalin took a deep breath to calm herself and held out her hand, palm up. \"Look and see.\"\nThe man with the mustache put his hand on top of hers. She felt his mind probe quickly through hers, and felt him turn over her memories of her own stay with the government. His eyes locked with hers and she felt understanding ripple through the link. \"I don't think there's anyone we could trust more, Talia,\" Tomas ... for she had read his name in the link ... said to the short woman. \"Let's move ... follow Kalin.\"\nKalin led them down the corridors and up the stairs, still helping Jaysen, the focused energy behind her supporting her. Before they went through the doors at the top of the stairs, Kalin said to Tomas, \"Do you sense anyone in the corridor?\"\nHe concentrated for a second. \"Not right in front of the doors,\" he said. \"Further away, two, maybe three people.\" He shook his head. \"I'm sorry, I'm not good enough to tell where they are.\"\n\"I'm fairly sure I know where they are,\" she said. She turned and spoke to the group, reinforcing her speech by sending out images to those who could receive them. \"About halfway down this corridor, just after the first juncture, there's a door on the left. Behind that door is the control room. There are probably two or three people in it. If you go right at the first juncture, the armory is the first door on your left. It should be unlocked.\"\nThe group looked grimly determined. \"People with weapons should hit the control room,\" said Tomas. \"The rest of us will hit the armory. When the power comes back on, we'll clean this place out.\" Then he said four words Kalin knew very well from her work in the underground. \"Now is the time.\" He looked at them once more. \"Let's go.\"\nNow is the time. The words known through the underground as the signal for full-scale revolt. Kalin shivered, trying to shut out a sudden mental flash of blood and fire. The people ran out into the corridor and split at the juncture. Talia was the first at the door to the control room, and opened fire as soon as she reached it. Tomas, even though he was unarmed, was right behind her. Through the fading link, Kalin glimpsed the control room. Three soldiers were dead in the room, one sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood, one face down on a console, the third staring at the door with a surprised expression still lingering in his dead eyes, his face slowly turning red from the blood running down. She sensed no regret from Tomas or Talia.\nShe understood why they felt they had to strike first, but was still ashamed. If we don't offer them mercy, she thought, carefully shielding herself from Jaysen, who was again semiconscious, how are we any better than them? She continued up the stairs, leading Jaysen, looking quickly at her chrono.\nThey had three minutes.\nTamsin vaulted up the final flight of stairs and pushed the door slightly ajar, not wanting to make the same mistake twice. She saw a tall, thin figure standing near the exit, holding a gun, and wished they'd planned to leave by the same doors they'd arrived by. Then she remembered her double downstairs, and smiled.\nShe pulled the hood off her head, shaking her hair out, entered the corridor and walked toward the exit quickly as if she had every right to be there. The man at the door looked at her, registering the copper hair and relaxing slightly. Then he saw her black clothing and began to stiffen, but it was too late. Tamsin grabbed his hand and gave his wrist a vicious twist. He dropped the gun and she kicked it down the hall. He recovered more quickly than Tamsin, throwing her hard into the opposite wall. She felt the concussion reverberate through her whole body, and barely kept on her feet. She had badly underestimated the man. He might be thin, but he was strong, and he was almost half a meter taller than she. She nearly laughed. Gentle Goddess, this man could kill me\u00c9\nThey stood face to face in the corridor, a few feet from the door. She eyed him carefully, trying to find a weak spot. Even his knees are a pretty high kick for me. No way can I aim for his throat. She looked at her face and her breath caught in her throat.\nHis face belied his height. He looked young --- far too young to be there. And those intense blue eyes; surely she'd seen them before. But where?\nHe spoke, and everything fell into place. \"What are you trying to do here?\" he asked, speaking in the soft, blurred tones of the city she'd grown up in. She could almost see him, younger, playing in the streets with the other children.\n\"I'm trying to fix a terrible wrong that's been done here,\" she said. She saw him flinch as he recognized her accent.\n\"How can you do this?\" he asked, angry and bewildered. \"You come from the West, from the same place I do. You know how bad it was for us. People were starving. They killed each other on the streets for drugs or a few credits. You go there now and it's changed. The streets are clean. People have jobs. They have hope! How can you try to destroy everything we worked for?\"\nTamsin felt as if she'd been slapped. His words brought her most buried feelings to the fore, the thoughts she held back when she listened to her friends in Ground Zero talk. She remembered what it had been like growing up, remembered walking by burnt-out buildings, remembered running away from the gangs. When she was lucky, she'd managed to run away from the gangs. She still bore the scars from when she'd been unlucky. And the government had done nothing about it. How could she work for the old one that had done nothing to help them? Even if the desire was to form a new coalition, some of the strongest supporters of Ground Zero were powerful members of the old, deposed government who had escaped Narid.\nThe desire to believe in a government that could make such improvements in the West was almost overpowering. But how could she not try to bring down a new one that had done such violence to her friends? \"The things that you've worked for have been built on a lie!\" she shouted, as much to herself as to him. \"Look at what's been done to the people here! They've been tortured, forced to betray their friends and family.\"\nHis fierce blue eyes snapped fire down at her. \"What did they do for us when we were in need? They ignored us. They just sapped our resources to improve their lives, then restricted us so we couldn't better ourselves.\"\nTamsin saw two figures dressed in black moving toward the doors from behind the guard. She had to keep him occupied until Jaysen and Kalin got through the door. She had to keep him talking. She didn't want to kill him.\n\"Those laws were made to protect the environment! Or would you have us be a planet of desert and sewage, like Old Earth?\" she said.\n\"If the laws were to protect the environment, why was only the West subject to them? Why was the East free to do as they would with their resources? The laws were made to keep us down!\"\nTamsin clenched her fists. He was voicing many of her own thoughts, thoughts she had rationalized away again and again. Worse, she was beginning, in some small corner of her mind, to believe in him. Kalin and Jaysen were almost through the door. She had to keep him talking, and came back to the one point that had kept her fighting against the new government. \"None of that excuses what is being done here! How can you support the way these people are treated. They aren't being treated this way for what they've done, but what they are. If you'd been born Gifted, you'd be down there instead of up here.\"\nShe saw him flinch, saw his jaw clench, and saw those intense blue eyes grow opaque. Suddenly she knew. \"You are Gifted. You hid it all your life to keep yourself safe, and now you're helping them hurt people just like you.\" Jaysen and Kalin were right behind him, about to go through the door. \"How can you not hate yourself for that?\"\nShe knew how he loathed himself for turning against people like him. She knew quite well. She felt the same way, because she'd done the same thing. She saw him begin to turn, and saw his eyes catch the motion behind him.\nShe reacted before she could think, before she could let him hurt her friends. She rushed him, and her right wrist snapped back just before it hit his chest. The blade slid between the ribs, through several inches of flesh. She felt the warm blood gush out over her hand and body as her other arm wrapped around him. She held him as he began to crumple to the floor, met his eyes and saw the shock and despair there. He tried to speak, but blood dripped out of his mouth.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she whispered to him, tears threatening to spill out. \"I'm so sorry.\" She held his hand as he died a few seconds later, and closed his eyes. Then she ran out the doors, covered in blood. She stopped, stone-still, as light exploded all around her, momentarily blinding her.\nTheir time was up.\nKalin saw Tamsin rush the tall guard, but didn't wait to see the results. She moved Jaysen out as fast as she could, aware that she couldn't maintain his barriers much longer. She had seconds, a minute at best.\nShe got him into the courtyard, but stopped for a moment when she saw the two military aircars sitting there, with Layten between them. She rushed forward. What the hell are you DOING here? she sent, as forcefully as she could.\nHe gave a little shrug, the one she found most infuriating. I believe it's called hijacking. Get in.\nShe shoved Jaysen into the rear of one car, sitting down beside him and fastening the safety harnesses, and took his hands. She knew Layten was waiting until the last possible second to take off. Do you know how to fly these things?\nNo, not really, he replied. But I'm interfaced with a computer that does.\nKalin sighed, then put it out of her mind. She would not worry about things she had no control over. Suddenly, the lights flashed on around them. She heard Layten call Tamsin's name. Beneath her hands, she felt a twitch, and felt something crumble in his mind. His body went limp as she felt his mind collapse.\nShe began probing his mind, trying to patch him together as she dimly heard the engines roar beneath them. She touched a recent memory, a painful one, and probed deeper. The whole event was flung into her mind, as strong as if it had happened to her.\nHe tried to take a deep breath and couldn't. \"What do you want from me?\"\nTamsin's damp, warm voice whispered in his ear again. \"Only the answers to a few questions.\" He heard tearing cloth as the knife traced down his spine, felt the blood following it. He didn't dare move, feeling burning where the blade cut him, on his arms, then again across his back and down, knowing even the slightest shift could mean worse damage. He knew the woman wasn't Tamsin, but it didn't matter. The shock of the image of his best friend hurting him held him frozen to the spot, paralyzed with fear and betrayal. He felt the tickle of her tongue again on his ear as he tried to lose himself in the pain, and ignore the knife. \"There's no reason I can't have fun while I ask,\" the voice laughed, as the knife traced down his spine, then lower.\nKalin traced one hand over her friend's brow, moving the hair out of his still-closed eyes. \"Oh, Jaysen,\" she whispered.\n\"You're hurt!\" Layten exclaimed.\nTamsin was aware that the grin on her face was probably maniacal at best. At some point in the past minute, she'd become very detached. She didn't really care what happened next. \"Don't worry, it's not mine. Can you cover us?\"\nLayten nodded. \"We're going to Kerna N'tali's compound. Once we get within those walls, the military won't dare touch us.\"\nTamsin felt the smile grow broader across her face. Someone inside her was screaming ... she told it to shut up. \"But first we have to get there. Leave your radio at 1430 megahertz - they don't usually monitor that channel. Good luck.\" She flung herself into the aircar, glancing quickly at Jaysen and Kalin in the back before she started it up. The car lifted quickly, and she brought it as high as she was willing to push it.\nA bass voice came over the radio. \"These are aircars, not suborbital vehicles.\"\n\"Yeah, I know, Layten. I'm just pushing it a little high.\"\nShe heard a hiss, then Layten spoke again. \"The records say it's not rated to go this high.\"\n\"Well, the records lie. They'll safely go a lot higher than the manufacturers say they will. It's a safety precaution against people like me.\" Tamsin banked sharply and made a beeline for the N'tali compound. Layten followed behind and at a somewhat lower altitude. Only one of the five moons were full, making them harder to spot.\nThere was silence for the next few minutes as both pilots concentrated on reaching their goal. Then Layten's voice crackled over the intercom. \"A car is coming at us from Capus. It'll be intersecting our path in two minutes.\" He paused, and Tamsin could almost hear the computer he'd interfaced with whirring. \"It's not hostile yet. It's coming to check out why we're traveling on an unscheduled flight path.\"\nTamsin let out a hiss of air between her teeth. Even though those back at the Killian Research Facility who were capable of warning the military of their theft probably weren't inclined to do so, transponders were placed on each car to make them traceable. She'd been hoping that, by the time they were noticed, they'd be in the N'tali compound. \"Layten, you do the talking. Audio only, if you can manage it. Find out the most plausible excuse from that computer, and use it. I'll be listening.\"\nA few seconds later, the radio shifted to the standard military frequency as the other car matched course with theirs. \"Ships S93-0760 and S93-0931, please state your course.\"\nLayten's voice sounded, deep and authoritative, over the radio. \"We're traveling to the N'tali compound.\"\n\"For what purpose?\" asked the other voice sharply.\n\"Our flight path and details of our mission are contained in memo dated 13\/12\/28, timecode 16:32.\"\nThe radio hissed. \"I can't access that file. It's protected ... Code Indigo,\" said the other car.\n\"Exactly. Your superior officer can check our orders.\"\nThere was another pause. The voice came again, less sure. \"I'd like a visual, please.\"\n\"I can't do that. Check Code Indigo procedures. No visual allowed.\"\n\"What are ---\"\nLayten's voice interrupted. \"I can't give you more information. I suggest you return to your base. And, soldier, I suggest you check Code Indigo procedures. If I wanted to, I could shoot you out of the sky right now for interfering.\"\nTamsin's finger itched over the trigger for the car's guns, but she held her fire. After a few seconds, the car banked and turned south. She spoke to Layten over their low frequency. \"That was close.\"\n\"Hopefully I intimidated him enough that he won't check that order.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Tamsin.\n\"Code Indigo orders come from a general. I could forge an audiovisual message with retina prints in two days, but not in thirty seconds. It's an empty message.\"\n\"ETA to N'tali compound is twelve minutes. Keep your fingers crossed.\"\nTamsin took a moment to look over her shoulder at Jaysen and Kalin. Jaysen sprawled, comatose, on the seat, his head on Kalin's shoulder. Kalin's ebony hair had fallen forward, obscuring both their faces.\nTamsin turned back to the console, and tried to quiet the thoughts that were filling her mind. How can you try to destroy everything we worked for? The guard's voice rang through her head.\nThey were within three minutes of the compound when she heard Layten's voice again. \"Our luck just ran out. There are three cars coming at us. They're big, they're armed to the teeth, and they'll get to us in forty-eight seconds.\"\n\"Scheiss'n,\" said Tamsin shortly. She checked her sensors. \"They're Enigma-class. Aim two meters ahead of the engine at the top of the car. The shielding's weak there, and the fuel line goes through it. One good hit, and it'll blow.\" She paused, and only heard static from the other end. \"Layten, please acknowledge.\" She switched bands, but still heard nothing but static. \"So they're jamming us,\" she said to herself. \"Well, they won't be able to hear each other, either.\" She hoped he'd heard her last message.\nShe put the car in a steep, fast dive and came at the lead car from above, feeling gravity tug against the safety harness. As the other car began to bank, she targeted ahead of the engine, fired and continued to dive below the wedge-shaped Enigma, plotting her course to come up behind the other two cars. Her shot hit dead on. The first car began losing altitude quickly, spitting a trail of smoke that quickly became flame. It exploded about four hundred meters from the ground. Tamsin tried to hold her car steady against the concussion waves buffeting it. She saw the forest below burst into flame.\nOne of the two remaining cars went briefly into a spin, then recovered. The other, further away from the blast, stayed steady and turned to intercept her. Tamsin looked at her sensors for Layten's car. The boxy vehicle was bobbing and weaving erratically. \"Layten, what the hell is wrong?\" she shouted, without hope of a response. She'd been lucky against the first car; they hadn't expected her to attack so quickly. She wasn't too sanguine about her chances against the other two.\nShe sent the car up as fast as she could, knowing the only way she could damage either of the other two cars was by an attack from above, where they were less heavily shielded. She also knew the cars would be expecting such an attack. She dove again, firing. This time the Enigmas moved quickly, dodging her shots. She scored a glancing shot against one of them, and completely missed the other. The fight was drifting, she noticed, coming closer and closer to the N'tali compound. If she was lucky, she'd soon be close enough to make a run for it.\nLayten was firing, too, with less luck than she was having, staying barely in range to do any damage. Tamsin pushed the car up again, tearing in a steep left-hand turn around and above the two cars. Both began firing at her, and her car bounced in response. She began to lose thrust. She swore loudly as she arced back toward them, preparing to fire once again.\nThrough talent or sheer blind luck, she didn't know which, Layten fired a shot which passed perhaps a meter below her car and hit one of the two remaining Enigmas. The car immediately began to list to one side. After a few seconds, it banked away, turning back toward its base.\nTamsin was jolted as another shot hit her from the remaining Enigma. She heard the engine hesitate, then continue, but with an underlying disonant hum. Her sensors were down; she was relying strictly on visual. She tried to gain altitude but didn't have the power. She braked sharply and the Enigma shot by her. She slammed her finger on the trigger as her car began to drop from the lack of momentum.\nNothing happened.\nShe slammed her hand against the console hard in frustration, and cursed the makers of the car as she accelerated quickly, making a beeline for the N'tali compound. The car responded jerkily, accelerating in fits and starts, slowly losing altitude. She had no idea where Layten was. The Enigma dropped out of sight in front of her. When she looked over her shoulder through the back window, she saw it coming up from below. It loomed behind her. She saw it shake, and shake again. Layten was firing, without much lasting effect. The N'tali compound was within sight, but she knew she didn't have a chance of reaching it. She braced herself for the Enigma's final shot.\nShe saw a bloom of fire come from the rear of the Enigma, then another. It crawled up the car, turning the black hull to red and gold. Then it exploded.\nTamsin's car tumbled forward end over end. She tried to adjust the spin, turning it into a side roll that was bringing her directly toward the compound. The ground below her revolved more and more slowly as she stabilized the car. The blue-green blur below her resolved itself into the lake and trees within the N'tali compound. As she pulled the car back to a stable, slow descent, she heard the engines sputter.\n\"Don't you dare stall yet!\" she shouted at the engines. Unlike the Enigmas, which could glide for quite a distance without power, her car was not very aerodynamic, and would drop like a stone when the engines cut out.\nShe was ten meters above the ground when the engines cut out. The car continued its gentle downward glide for a few seconds, then dropped. Tamsin heard a crash as the dark closed around her.\nShe woke to hands brushing her body. She instinctively grabbed for them.\n\"Tamsin, it's Chas! Don't hurt me!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm just brushing the glass off you.\"\nShe opened her eyes. Everything was blurry, and her stomach began to heave. Chas moved to the side and pulled her head forward as she began to vomit all over the shattered console. When she was done, he gave her a sip of water. She noticed, in a detached way, that the cloth he was wiping her face with came away red. She also saw three of them. \"How are Kalin and Jaysen?\" she asked.\n\"They're fine ... a lot better than you, as a matter of fact. They're being brought inside now. You destroyed Kerna's flower garden.\"\nShe could smell gardenias, roses and violets all around her. \"Whoops. I was aiming for the landing pad.\"\n\"You missed,\" said Chas. \"But the trees to the side of the garden broke your fall. You were lucky.\"\nTamsin felt very remote, as if she were dreaming. Her eyes began to sag shut. She felt a sting against her cheek and realized Chas had slapped her. \"Don't you dare go to sleep,\" he said. \"You've got a bad concussion.\"\n\"What happened to Layten?\" she asked.\n\"I lost contact with the computer when they jammed the radio signals,\" a bass voice said. \"And I really have no idea how to fly those things.\"\n\"So we threw you in the water and you learned how to swim. Great,\" she said, closing her eyes.\n\"Don't shut your eyes!\" Chas yelled at her, and her eyes snapped back open. She stared at the green shadows above her and heard voices rumbling in the background.\n\"No, she can't be moved, it's too dangerous. We'll have to do it here,\" she heard as the green patterns in front of her began to swell and change shape. She felt herself slide down a tunnel.\nA few days later, Chas walked on the green path by the lake, escaping momentarily the visuals of the standoff at the Killian Research Institute. A copper-haired figure stood at the edge of the water, throwing rocks at the glassy surface. She tossed him a wave as he came closer.\n\"How are you feeling?\" he asked her.\n\"I feel fine,\" she said. \"The upper third of my vision is still gone, though. It's like I'm wearing a hat all the time.\"\n\"There isn't any permanent damage. It'll come back soon,\" he said.\nShe stared at him. \"What?\" he asked.\n\"You saw me just this morning. What do you really want to talk to me about?\" she asked.\nHe stared out at the water and tried to form his words carefully. \"It's about Jaysen.\"\nShe walked away from him a few steps, keeping her back to him. \"I don't think I want to hear what you're going to tell me.\"\n\"Kalin's been working with him steadily. He's holding together now.\"\n\"So why can't I see him?\" asked Tamsin angrily, turning around.\nChas hesitated. \"How much do you know about what they did to him?\"\n\"Enough,\" she snapped. \"I had a run-in with her.\"\n\"Kalin feels that it would be best if Jaysen didn't see you for a while,\" said Chas.\n\"How long do you mean?\"\n\"We don't know. But she thinks that if he saw you right now, it could do a lot of damage.\"\n\"You mean it would send him over the edge again.\" She laughed bitterly and threw a rock into the lake. \"It's like he's still locked up there. Sometimes I wish he was dead. Then I'd have a reason to grieve, to miss him. Even if I do get to see him again, it won't be\u00c9him.\"\nChas walked toward her and put a hand on her arm. He hesitated, then decided to tell her. \"Tamsin, Jaysen was in love with you.\"\nShe shook his arm off. He looked at her face. Her jaw was clenched and her eyes were burning. Her breath came fast. \"Chas, please go away.\"\n\"Tamsin ---\"\n\"Chas, I have an overwhelming desire to hit something repeatedly,\" she said. Her voice was like brittle glass shards. \"I'd rather it wasn't you.\"\nChas walked back up the path. Before he went between the trees, he looked back toward the lake. Tamsin still stared at the water, an alarming lack of expression on her face.\nChas went to the house, intending to ask Kalin to check on Tamsin, not sure what she might do next. Layten was sitting in the middle of the room, holograms all around him.\nChas stared at the flickering images of fire and blood. The research facility wasn't the only building in dispute now. \"What's happening?\" he asked.\nLayten's voice was triumphant, yet bleak. \"Revolution.\"\nNicole Gustas (ngustas@hamp.hampshire.edu) just got accepted to American\nUniversity and is now frantically searching for a job and housing in\nWashington DC.

He a Motor Man, Copyright(c)1992 thas why. All Motor Mans, first to lass, is bad!\"\nOn the trak, there was nothin' for the babies to do but jes rest they minds. They be trandscendin' the worlds - all the worlds that anybody evah thought of. They don't have to be thinkin' bout nothing' at all anymore.\nBut Old General Ven, he be tryin to call `em back. that high-rankin' ole sumbitch, he all the time tryin to yank `em back down. He a Motor Man, thas why. All Motor Mans, first to lass, is bad!\nThem babies rollin around on the trak, and they payin no mind to Old Ven. And ever time he come, he try to get `em down, but they not lissnen. And after while he give up, and he come over to where I'm layin on the floor, and he say all that metal talk at me. And when I don't answer back, he give me a kick in mah ribs. Then he go out the place and the door shut behind him and you hear them magnetic bolts lockin into place.\nMost times, I jes lay there and watch them babies. I watch `em rollin, cause I can see `em. Old Ven, he know I can see `em, and it make him mad as hell - cause he can't. He a Motor Man, he ain't got livin eyes, not like me. I guess thas why he keep on lettin' me live. He kick me sometimes, but he won't kill me. If he kill me, he know he won't never get them babies!\nI lie and watch long through the night, and them babies they shining in mah mind, they like the sunrise what used to come on this here planet, they like what used to be stars in the night. They singing too - not like any song, not `zactly a sound, but I hears `em. And when them babies sing, it sho do grab me.\nThen I got to fight like hell not to think of the way it wuz. I got to fight to stay steady just like I is now, and keep on bein just what I done decided to be. I can't even think one single thought that ain't in line with that, else them Motor Mens be tracin it on machines they got. So I lie still and lissen to them babies singing, and if I think `bout anything, I be dam sure it's somethin like feels good to be scratching fleas, or how tasty corn pone is with molasses poured on it. Stuff like that.\nAnd it's been near about fifteen days now, but I doin it so good that Old Ven and them other Motor Mens ain't picked up a thing yet. And mah babies, they safe on the trak where Old Ven, even he do be a General and got all his science mens with him, he can't get `em down. No sir, long as theys on the trak, they gone! They got no bodies, they got no minds, they got nuthin he can grab hold of, nuthin he can download. And it `bout to drive Old Ven and them crazy. I lie there, and I'm anxious as hell, but all the time I be laffin too.\nWe ain't safe yet, no way. There be one of them babies ain't restin her mind too good, she sometime lose hold of what's happenin. And she come down a little bit then, and she sorta like hang her head down over the trak. And she be callin out, wantin' to know if it maybe it be good to come down to the world again, like Old Ven been sayin' over and over. She startin' to innerface again, with this damned world she don't even know is trashed.\nI calls her Glo, and I says, \"Glo, you git back! Long as I'm here, you ain't no way comin down! So don't be thinkin `bout it. You go back to restin yo mind!\"\nShe say, \"I remember things. I remember.\"\nAnd the more she remember, the more she start to take on shape. And I got to nip that in the bud right there, damn quick!.\nSo I say, \"Glo, git on back now! What's the use of me bein here, and layin on this hard floor night after night like a old dog, if you gonna fool around that way? If you let Old Ven talk you down, then he gonna kill me. That what you want?\"\nShe say, \"I'll go back, but talk to me a little first, Gabriel. When I start remembering things, I get so terribly lonely.\"\nI say, \"Okay, Honey, we chat a little bit. But then you go back to restin' yo mind on nuthin, like them others.\"\nShe say, \"How many of us are there, Gabriel?\" She axed me this question before, but I got to tell her again and again `cause when she outta mind she can't remember.\n\"They's twenty-four of you,\" I reminds her. \"You a dozen positive and a dozen negative. And you is the last ones on this here planet, so you gotta remember that, okay?\"\n\"I'll remember,\" she say. But she sounding sleepy and dreamy, and I know she `bout ready to go back. Which is fine, `cause no matter how much pleasure I might git outta chattin, it ain't good for her to be thinkin and talkin. If Old Ven come in while she in her mind, then it'a be hell to pay. Then if she take a form, he be able to grab her. Then we all be up shit creek.\nShe say, \"I wanted to ask you, Gabriel...\"\n\" `Bout what, Honey?\"\n\"How is it that you're in a body? Why didn't you die... like all the others?\"\nBut she startin to lose her mind shape right then, and in a minnit she back on the trak restin along with them others, and she be transcendin all the worlds. I hates to lose her company, but all the same I give a sigh of relief. Now we all safe for another night. Nothin won't be happenin on this here world.\nIt weren't even mornin yet. Old Ven he come in, and a bunch of Motor Mens followin him, and they makin their metal talk. They walks up and down, up and down, and they starin at the track, and they hookin up wires and makin beeps. But after a while they sees it ain't doin no good. No way can they access them babies.\nSo Old Ven he come over to where I'm layin and this time he don't kick, he squats down and he stares. Then he start in to talkin at me. He know I don't unnerstand no metal talk, I be too low a form, but he keep on. He lookin' at mah eyes, and he even tryin' to smile - which is a pitiful sight on the face of a Motor Man, lemmie tell you! - and then he waitin for me to feedback.\nBut I ain't sayin nothin, `cause by now there ain't nothin for me to say to the likes of him. Things is the way they is: the babies is the last ones, and the Motor Mans is stranded, and we all here in it together. He gonna keep tryin to git them babies, and I'm gonna keep tryin to make damn sure he don't so there ain't nothin to be said. Old Ven, he know this good as I do.\nThen, I guess he make up his mind to do somethin he ain't tried before. He grab me up and start walkin out the door of that room with me. But `bout that time the trak commence to shiver and shake, and it makin' a terrible whine, and the babies rollin faster and faster. `Cause me and them babies, we linked up. We been linked up all through time, whatever shape we be in. Back before the end, half the time them babies didn't even know it - they just goin along, bein first one thing and then another, and they ain't studyin `bout no linkup. And me, I be lookin like whatever I done decide to look like, and most the time them babies ain't catchin on to who or whut I wuz. But that don't make no nevermind, `cause we got the link. We got the synchronous wave goin, we ain't never outta touch with each other. So when Old Ven he try to take me outta there and do somethin bad to me, them babies they feelin it and they commencin to waller around.\nSo Old Ven he see he can't do it that way or them babies gonna go clean out they minds. And maybe they quit lyin there all nice in a row, hummin that soft song, and maybe they start to go crazy and throw theyselfs around. If all twenty-four of `em gits crazy and raisin hell all at once, that old trak ain't gonna stand the pressure, it'a break sure as hell! Them babies, they got power they don't even know theyselfs how much power, `cause they keep on forgettin.\nBut ah know.\nAnd Old Ven, he know. Him and his science mens, they smart enough to figure out about the trak, `cause they seen ones just like it on them other planets. And they smart enough to build this here magnetic room to hold it, knowin its the attractor for them babies, and they gonna come straight to it when everthing else break down. But Old Ven he also know he got to play it easy, else he end up with nothin - the trak broke, and them babies withered up and dead, not fit to make no shapes a'tall.\nSo he put me back down on the floor and he wave his hand to them other Motor Mens. They come over and they holdin me down, pretendin they gonna be easy like, but they starts in puttin' them wires on me, stickin `em in with little bitty pins. They got me wired through everplace they can, and it ain't hurtin too much. But it's makin somethin rise in me, they's a rushin feelin in me, and they's sparks startin to jump out from all over mah hide.\nSo I have to hold real still, and keep on thinkin to myself over and over how I ain't gonna change my shape, how I ain't gonna let `em shake me loose from this here form I took on, which is what I made up mah mind to be, back when the end done come.\nThey pumpin the juice through them wires and the sparks is jumpin out, and Old Ven he come and hunker down on the floor beside me and he start to talk at me again.\nHe say, \"Our readings show that you are not at all a primitive vertebrate, as you have the appearance. You are a Monad, merely taking this shape.\"\nI keepin' myself real still. I tellin' mahself over and over the way I wants it to be.\nOld Ven he nod to them Motor Mens and they pour on more juice, and them wires in me they start to heat up. They stingin like wasps used to be, and then they burnin like red-hot needles, but I go on tellin mahself I got to stand it, `cause they's no way I'm lettin him get them babies.\nWell...they keep on doin it for a long time, a damn long time. Finally, he tell `em shut off the juice, and he let me drink a little water from a tube he got.\nHe say, \"The drink will make you feel at ease.\"\nThat drink taste funny, but it do in fact make me feel a whole lot better. Then he give me some more. And then they start pumpin the juice through them wires again, but now they ain't hurtin a'tall. Everwhere on me that one of them wires is pinned through, there's a fine feelin, like starting to tremble with some kinda crazy joy, starting to roll with it, startin to take it on home, so fine that I can`t stop.\nOld Ven's talkin through the waves risin in me, and he sound so fine and mellow and like he mah friend, and he say, \"Now, tell me who you are. Tell me what your name is.\"\nI ain't wantin to say nothin to Ven, but it sorta leak outta me without my knowin. \"I be Gabriel, boss.\"\nHe say, \"Tell me now, what form did you have before the destruction?\"\nI tryin to sort of growl but it come out a whine, and I can't keep mahself from answerin. \"Wuz humanoid, boss.\"\nOld Ven say, \"What is the purpose of this form you have assumed? It is not in the index of creatures which were indigenous to this planet. There is nothing like it in our archives. There were hirsute quadrapeds, but none with the cranial formation you have assumed. You appear to have amalgamated disparate species. What is the purpose?\"\nI tryin hard as hell to keep mah mouth shut, I tryin to think `bout scratchin fleas, but that water he give me makin mah head swim. The words comin out of me and there ain't nothin I can do.\n\"That old blast come too soon,\" I tell him. \"I wudden no way ready! I was jest then thinkin `bout how I gotta get me a form that nobody gonna pay no attention to.\"\n\"But you could have disincorporated, returned to baseline presence.\"\n\"No, boss, no. You don't unnerstan. I do that and they's no way I can hang around and watch after them babies. I had to get me a form real quick, I had to choose somethin. And I was standin there thinkin `bout all the stuff I done ever knowed on this planet.\"\n\"Cultural images?\" Ven axes me. \"Mythical images?\"\n\"Everthing, first to lass,\" I tell him. \"Run it through mah head, from the time it first started up on this here dirt-ball all the way down to when you muthfukkin Motor Mens come flyin down.\"\n\"What technological devices did you employ?\" he axe me.\n\"I don't have no truck with that stuff,\" I tell him. \"Ain't needin it. I just be scannin through all I got in mind, and then I be whatever I decides to be. But when the blast come, it taken me by surprise. And I flashed on pictures I seen in a little old book, one time when I was bein a child. I recollected them pictures I seen once, `cause they be folks nobody gonna notice much.\"\n\"What pictures?\" Ven axe me.\n\"They was Old Uncle Tom. And nother `bout Old Dog Tray.\"\nVen say, \"Explicate Uncle Tom form. Explicate Dog Tray form.\"\nBut I start to lose hold long about then. I start to lose mah grasp of vernacular and mah Tom-Tray persona but, damn that drink, I couldn't stop talkin. \"It got mixed...between least animal and least human...\"\nVen saw I was losing verbal control. He jerked my head up. \"Your origin?\" he demanded. \"Inside the System or outside?\"\n\"Outside.\"\n\"Will they send a mission to retrieve you?\"\n\"No,\" I said, with difficulty. \"...guardian... take surviving archiplasms... out.\"\nVen dropped my head and talked to the other Motor Men. I was in a black and buzzing place and couldn't distinguish what they said. Then he came back to me. And the wires began to heat up once more. Now it was pain and pleasure mixed intolerably, so that I could neither accept nor reject. I had to fight very hard to keep myself from leaving form. You do not know the excruciation form can be until it is tormented.\nHe eased it very slightly, and said, \"We can keep you embodied and held precisely at this point for a long, long time. You are a Monad, you cannot expire. We can prevent your disincorporating. And there is nothing - nothing anywhere - that can intervene.\"\nHe had them heat the wires a little hotter. \"It is imperative that we have the surviving archiplasms! They must come back into form. They must re-initiate organic life on this planet.\"\n\"This world is dead,\" I managed to say. \"You won't be able to start it again. It's a corpse.\"\n\"We risked a great deal in order to take this habitat,\" Ven said. \"But it is useless, as it is now. We cannot return to where we came from because it is destroyed, and we cannot continue here without organic life to provide raw materials. Those last surviving archiplasms must enter into form, they must re-boot generation.\"\n\"Slavery,\" I said. \"Never-ending slavery.\"\n\"You can see them, so you must bring them down from the trak. You must force them to take back consciousness of worlds.\"\nHe leaned down and stared at me with his unliving eyes. \"Our entire future depends on what you do - on what I can make you do,\" he amended. \"You will acquiese eventually, Monad, so why not do it now and save yourself great suffering?\"\nThe heat of the wires increased. The mad pleasure increased. The body I had taken on convulsed and there was a muzzle of white froth suffocating me. I twisted and kicked and tried to bite, to claw, but it was no use. Maybe I had whined before, but now I howled - I howled and howled!\nThe long wavering howl reverberated against the walls of the room, its coils distorting and amplifying the sound. The archiplasms were outside comprehension of worlds, but maybe they heard. Or maybe it was the age-old linkup between us. They rolled faster, wobbling with erratic motion, all of them. But it was Glo who went completely crazy and came off the trak.\nShe hurtled out into a shape without stopping to consider, without stopping to choose, or to build carefully. She came out a billowing giant, a mushroom monster, a whirlwind of blizzard ice and lashing cold, a glacier thing crunching and booming as it approached. It was a burst of manifestation hurled at the Motor Men. They only turned and looked, registering it as a phenomenon.\nShe saw the lack of affect and changed instantaneously, belching flame and blast, torching them massively in plumes of white-hot burning. Their uniforms melted faintly at the edges. That was all.\nRecalculating, she hovered a moment as a diaphanous undulating blackness, a filmy eclipse of light. Then the blackness exhaled like the lung of a black hole. It was a dense puff of inky softness. It was a heavy cloud of burning rubber. It was a suffocating slow cyclone of carbon and hair-spray and graphite.\nThe glittering exteriors of the Motor Men became smudged. They could not get visuals. Their circuits spasmed, flickered, then jammed. Their white uniforms were besmirched. The glinting lights on their helmets stopped sparkling. They went static, some just turning their heads, some raising a gauntleted hand to ward off the gritty cloud.\nGeneral Ven froze where he kneeled beside me. His platinum alloy mouth was open to frame the next question. Cinders sifted slowly down, frosting his golden face. The lights behind his crystal eyes went out.\nThen Glo became a hundred hands, like the old statues of Avalokitesvara, all of them yanking at the wires pinned into me. When the wires were a tangle on the floor, her rage subsided, and she disassembled. With a delicate tremor of the surrounding air, she incorporated Glo once more, the way I had been seeing her on the trak, the way she best remembered herself.\n\"I had to come down,\" she said with a quaver in her voice. \"They were hurting you, Gabriel!\"\nI wanted to tell her how stupendous she had been, I wanted to praise her cleverness and power. I wanted to tell her that, as it had always been, she was the glittering blade and I was the sturdy handle holding her sharpness. But because she was back in \"a world\", she would not understand such talk - she wouldn't understand till we were home. It was `Gabriel' who had brought her out of the unknowing, had wrenched her down from the trak, so it was Gabriel I had to remain until we were all safe.\n\"Honey, you done fine!\" I said. \"But now you git back! Old Ven and them is froze, we can break through that door and get out of this dam hellhole. But you got to get back on the trak, Glo, and rest yo mind!\"\nShe didn't move.\n\"Girl, if you be in any shape, if you be in any form at all, you won't be able to git through. You hear what I'm sayin?\"\n\"Oh, Gabriel,\" she said, tears rising in her eyes, \"just let me stroke your head once.\"\nShe came and kneeled down. She took my embodied head in her hands and looked into my eyes. She scratched a little behind my ears. She said, \"I always was a fool about animals.\"\nI said, \"Now git yo self back on the trak, rest yo damned mind, girl! We gettin the hell outta here!\"\nShe got back.\nAll them babies started in to roll, and roll, and roll like glory! The wuz amps rising, the decibels wuz rising! I so hyped I come all the way outta my form. I taken on humanoid shape and ran to that door and heaved open the latch and pushed open that ton of metal. I was outside at last, after all those days! I punched the buttons on the console outside and crashed the whole entire system.\nThen the trak started to flash rays in the visible bandwidth. It started to move, slowly at first, then speeding up. It came straight out of that magnetic room and started to glide upward like a steel shaft. It blasted the roof off the place. There was no more atmosphere, so it left no trail.\nI shucked body, discarding neural templates for all the various possible disguises from all the centuries, and followed the trak upward, out of the System.\nThe crazed world would not be born again to serve Motor Men. The last twenty-four archiplasms were out of form now forever, and free. They rode the ancient trak, hurtling for Home.\nI followed along behind, traveling easy, traveling light, and herding them like a cheerful shepherd.\nLou Crago has published mainly poetry, but now has decided SF is probably the most enticing literary form around, and is goint to try to write more of it. Other interests include Hindu astrology, southern cooking, and virtual reality.\nCrago_L@CUBLDR.COLORADO.EDU","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}

However, before 1986, certain types of ice-based surfaces had been noticed on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter; and it is with a short explanation of these that I begin this small article on Triton.\nThe major moons of Jupiter that are composed of ice are Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa. Callisto has a ``classic'' small-body surface -- it is covered with craters of various sizes, at least at first glance. At a closer look, however, an observer can find numerous faults and ridges on that battered world. Ganymede is cratered as well, but it shows much evidence of internal activity -- the large, light colored upwellings that cover the moon. Europa is perhaps one of the few worlds without craters; instead, its molten (read fluid H$_{2$O) interior erases evidence of cratering by periodic fissure eruptions from the numerous linear features.\nSaturn's ice moons, however, are much larger in number. Luckily, though, some of them are fundamentally the similar -- variations on a fugue, if you will. For example, Rhea and Dione both have streaked surfaces -- most probably the result of fluid water upwelling from the fractures of the crust. Meanwhile, Enceladus shows many prominent ice ridges, a result of more energetic ice volcanism. Also, its white surface bespeaks a geology that recycles the surface, rather than letting the meteorite impacts darken the surface. Tethys and Mimas show many small fault criss-crossing the surface. Finally, Iapetus has confused everyone by its extreme hemispherical differences -- one icy light like the rest of the moons of Saturn, and one black as charcoal. Possibly there was an upwelling of carbonaceous ice from the deep core of Iapetus. Titan, while quite definitely large enough to have a very interesting surface, is shrouded in clouds; so it is rather regrettably obvious that I must skip this planet-sized moon.\nUranus's quadruplets look nothing like each other, aside from the cratering that all bodies in the solar system have suffered. Oberon, the outermost, shows some evidence of crater-filling volcanism, but none for fissure eruptions or faulting. Titania has the start of faulting and fissure eruptions, in addition to some crater-filling. Umbriel shows no evidence at all for an active geology. Ariel has a planet-wide system of fissure eruptions and faults. Finally and most extremely, Miranda shows almost all types of volcanism and tectonism -- faults, fissure eruptions of both pure and carbonaceous ice, and compressional faults. About the only type of volcanism that it fails to have is what we associate with when we hear the word ``volcano'' -- mountainous volcanism.\nFinally, we come to Triton. As you may have expected, Triton has a geological ``style'' all its own. Using the pictures from the November Scientific American, I have noticed some features that could be caused by the moon's internal geological processes. The first, going from south to north, are the plumes covering the polar cap. These are probably ``lava'' (most likely carbonaceous ice) from local volcanos. The second is the polar cap itself, caused by volcanic outgassing. The third is the system of faults in the non-capped areas, probably the result of expansion of the core as the frozen crust trapped the heat. The fourth are the open, unmarked areas; caused by ice ``lava flows'' flooding lowlands and freezing. The fifth is the ``cantaloupe'' terrain that seems to cover the rest of the moon; this complex of hills and valleys could be the result of local volcanism. Much of the terrain is uncratered, which means that the moon is still active.\nAs far as is known, none of the ice worlds look completely alike. All have their own idiosyncrasies. The ``pearls-on-a-string'' theory of ice moon geology is utterly dead. Another matter left for consideration is that these moons are imperfectly mapped -- some only have less than a hemisphere mapped. Perhaps the best thing for the study of ice moons are going to be the Galileo and Cassini rocket probes, as they will map the ice moons of Jupiter and Saturn completely.\nList of References\nBriggs, G.A., & F.W.

She brushed tangled black hair over her tanned shoulder and bent a delicate equine ear to the enchantingly beautiful music coming from within. Intrigued, she peeked in, her wide brown eyes searching for the talented singer.\nAcross the circle: a silhouette sat in the many-colored shifting light of the Tangled Web nebula. The feline bard's bright green-gold eyes looked out at her audience from under a well-brushed mane of dark black hair and short triangle ears of calico fur. She wore a simple burgundy red shipsuit, her only concessions to fashion her jeweled earrings. Her slender arms danced over the strings of a crystal harp, and she sang, a sweet purring voice that filled the room without seeming to.\nThat voice drew her listeners into the teaching ballad every child knew, the song of the famed spacefarer Mikato, who grew up an Owned Person in the days before Ragnarok when humans, deified by science, could call down lightning or raise up palaces at a moment's whim. The Owned People were created in their image and yet different, that the humans might be admired, waited upon, even worshiped. Yet a few, the Compassionate, took pity on their playthings and set free those they could.\nThe Compassionate named Mikato captain and crew of the sentient ship `Starlight Runner' and sent him forth to seek out a new world for the Free People, one of suitable climate and far from human affairs so that they might develop on their own. His wife, the young and pretty Amaranth, and the best of the people the Compassionates freed slept in cryogenic capsules while he outwitted the dangers that waited beyond human space.\nAt last Mikato found Elyse, a glowing blue-green pearl in the cloth of the Tangled Web. Too ancient and long in space ever to return to planetary gravity, he shed tears watching as `Starlight Runner' sent the final shuttle to the surface bearing Amaranth's cryocoffin. Forever apart from his wife who remained still young and even more beautiful than he'd remembered, out of despair Mikato plunged his ship into the heart of Elyse's star and died.\nAs the bard sang the last keening songs of Mikato's dirge, a growing silence fell. Then, one by one, her listeners clapped, filling the room with wild applause.\nIntending to offer a drink to the singer, the centaur took two glasses filled with amber-gold nectar from the bartender and trotted past a group of stunned vulpines returning slowly to their neglected drinks. She found two unwelcome tiger-men admirers ahead of her. The singer batted ineffectually at their grasping paws; her whiskers bristled angrily at their coarse whisperings. Nearby patrons murmured disapprovingly but declined to intervene, noting the mercenaries' weapons they carried.\nThe centaur stepped in casually and tapped one of them on the shoulder. He turned about lazily to stare right into the muzzle of an antique 12mm semi-automatic pistol. Made fearless by intoxication, he lazily drawled, \"Got a permit for that?\"\n\"Better than that. Diplomatic immunity.\" The centaur flicked the safety off with an audible click, causing the tiger-man to sober up quickly. He glanced down to his weapons, all securely holstered and locked away beyond any chance of his outdrawing her, then tapped his companion on the shoulder. They slinked out, ears flattened.\n\"I'm Zephyr-Racer of Chrysanthemum, Riftworlds ambassador,\" the centaur said, briskly. She replaced her automatic pistol in a belt pouch and passed one of the drinks she carried to the singer who accepted it gladly. \"But my friends call me Zephyr.\"\n\"Ariaou, a novice bard of Meetpoint Academy,\" the bard replied quietly. Then, tail curling in a suddenly concerned S-curve, she asked, \"How may I repay you for your help?\"\n\"Our debt's paid by the memory of your beautiful singing. But you've not the look of the industrialist or academician about you. Why're you bound for Ryme?\" Zephyr cocked her equine ears forward, all curiosity, and rested her elbows on the table.\n\"It's a long tale, and sometimes, I think, half imagined,\" Ariaou murmured, sipping the nectar and sitting back on her chair. \"Perhaps I've spent sixteen long, lonely years chasing a foolish child's dreams.\"\nAriaou struck a chord on her crystal harp, beginning a steady rhythm and melody. She sang softly, her words interwoven with her playing, of fair Mnehim, a lush M'nahnee colony world far to the coreward side of the nebula. A warm summer afternoon colored the trees golden, sunlight setting on the verdant forest and sparkling brightly off the rounded stones within a gurgling brook. Two kittens played nearby, one calico, the other black.\nShe murmured softly over her playing, \"Tommiau and I argued over pebbles in a stream, each claiming the other's stone was worthless and his or her own a precious gem. We paid little heed to the lengthening shadows and the first sweet songs of the nightingales. Then an elusive melody came dancing through the trees.\"\nA shiver ran down Zephyr's spine at the pure silvery tones of the song, pale shadow though it was of the music Ariaou had heard so long ago. It spoke of a wanderer with laughing eyes, of his joy in visiting faraway stars and worlds, and his delight in bestowing enigmas upon those he met, that they might prosper and grow in the understanding. Deep strength and wisdom ran beneath his bright song, and a sadness born of millenia.\n\"We gave chase, thinking at every turn that the musician would step out of the brush, so close he seemed, his song weaving about us sweetly. And behind us, unheard, a forest predator loped, yellow eyes shining ferally in the moonlight. It hungered, seeking easy prey for a midnight supper.\"\nAriaou's song tumbled over itself, wove into danger: a young Ariaou fell to the forest floor, and Tommiau cried for help, all alone, surrounded by blinking eyes in the underbrush. Dark shapes ghosted overhead, the carrion birds following the predator hopefully, their cries raucous. The wolf crouched, its sinews tightening into steel coils for the pounce--\n\"It howled forlornly and fell out of the bush, run through and through by the horn of a golden unicorn that stepped out behind. He shone in the moonlight, his voice warm as sunshine, and his eyes clear sky blue. He sang to us with amusement: such brave kittens we were to run free in the woods, but had we no parents to watch over us?\"\nYoung Ariaou and Tommiau clambered onto the unicorn's back. His grand song arched over them, cascading glissandos of starlight notes forming a rainbow road on which they galloped over the treetops. The forest sped by as if they flew on true wings of song, with a herd of other unicorns all the colors of the spectrum galloping beside the golden unicorn.\n\"Tommiau fell asleep on our ride, as the unicorn intended, but I did not. In the morning, he awoke remembering nothing of the night's events, and my stories were met with disbelief and scoldings, for there were no such animals as unicorns in the modern world.\"\nAriaou continued, quietly, the music fading to gentle strumming. \"For sixteen years, I've studied music at Meetpoint Academy. Nine years gone by, my parents were killed when terrorists hijacked their starliner. Three years ago, my brother Tommiau was murdered at King Ascenion's coronation. And still I search for the unicorn, and his songs, my own unreachable star in the heavens.\"\nAriaou let a final questing note ring into silence on her crystal harp. Zephyr remained wordless for a time, then reached over to give the singer a warm hug, which the feline accepted with a thankful purr.\nSix hours later, the starliner `Lady of Nine Trumps Unblown' docked with the Ryme deep space station `Quiet Reason', a large, nickel-iron asteroid moved into the Oort cloud centuries ago and excavated. Ariaou watched fascinatedly as the ship slowly folded its warpspace vanes and drifted slowly into the huge cavern of the spaceport on jets of compressed air. A spiderweb of docking lines spun slowly about the spindle-like craft, holding it in place.\nThey disembarked into the pressurized corridors of the station, having elected to share quarters. Zephyr guided Ariaou past the officials at the customs desk and through the station's labyrinthian corridors. \"I want you to meet my friends,\" Zephyr said. \"You'll like them. There'd be only a few diplomats here, but the Dragon Queen's called a nebula-wide trade conference.\"\n\"Dragon Queen?\" Ariaou asked softly. Her ears flicked curiously.\n\"The Coordinator of Ryme. Mirdis Shakherak Tarekkha Nazk, for short, her full name would take far too long to remember and recite. I think she secretly prefers our name for her.\" Zephyr grinned mischievously.\n\"Mirdis...\" Ariaou murmured to herself. \"I've seen that name before.\" She searched her shipsuit, came up with a video pad, tapped several buttons with claw-tips, then showed Zephyr the letter.\n\"Interesting,\" Zephyr mused. \"She politely invited you to visit the recently excavated pre-Ragnarok ruins, and included a ticket aboard the `Lady of Nine Trumps Unblown'. Yet I know that the ruins have been closed to tourists and scientists until the initial mapping has been completed. It's not often the Dragon Queen takes such mysterious actions.\"\nThe feline bard nodded. \"I have no idea how I could have come to her notice, but 'tis my hope that in the ruins I may find something to help me in my quest. Though the unicorns are long gone from this universe, their memories linger in the ancient relics of the past.\"\n\"I'd be careful, though. Mirdis will probably want something in return.\" Zephyr shook her head ruefully, causing her hair to swirl gracefully. \"She's sharp, cunning, a hard bargainer-- they wrote the proverb `Never play chess with a dragon' just for her. But if I don't play her games, how am I going to find out if I'm good enough to come away with whole horsehide?\"\nZephyr stopped in front of the fifth level conference room, palmed the lock. The door irised open. Within, instead of the many people standing about chatting and laughing that Zephyr clearly expected, a gleaming bronze-scaled draconian shape filled the far wall of the oval room. She raised her head, regarding them with opalescent black eyes that reflected the dim starlight of the overhead skylight.\nAfter a moment's silence, the Dragon Queen drummed her claws impatiently. \"It's terribly impolite to leave the door open like that. This is not an official meeting, Zephyr, so you may dispense with the frightened look. Now, come and examine this position.\"\nUpon an ivory and onyx chessboard on a granite pedestal, five chess pieces stood ranged, each a different color and shape, all of the finest quality. \"I've seen this game before,\" Ariaou said hesitantly. \"But there were many more pieces, and they were white and black, not all colors.\"\n\"This is a fairy chess variant in which each piece has its own ambitions and allies. They may work together, but only if it serves their own interests. Observe.\" Mirdis moved an orange-streaked marble pawn a step forward. \"The pawn's moved to the seventh row, about to advance and be promoted to a superior piece.\"\nThe dull grey steel king, cut with knife-like edges, moved next to the pawn, threatening its advance. A translucent glass knight that shimmered with rainbows swept in to defend the pawn's imminent move but itself coming under attack. \"The knight sacrifices itself, a subtle and elusive piece, in the hope of far greater gain.\"\nMirdis placed a smoothly polished rook of dark brown wood along the row of the pawn. \"The rook supports the pawn, threatening the king indirectly.\"\nAnother uncomfortable moment passed as they studied the board and the remaining unmoved piece, a glittering gold queen of smooth curves, before a dry rasping voice came from behind. \"Fascinating, lady Mirdis. Yet we have little time for trivialities.\"\nAriaou whirled about, saw a familiar grey-cloaked figure, his face shrouded by a starry black veil. She exclaimed softly, \"Tarnkappe!\"\n\"Do you know this mysterious person, Ariaou?\" Mirdis asked.\n\"We've met,\" Tarnkappe snapped. \"May we dispense with small talk?\"\n\"By no means,\" Mirdis purred, producing a silver tray of tea, coffee, and biscuits. \"Tell me about him, dear feline.\" Zephyr passed the cups, evidently glad of an excuse to do something besides look confused.\nWhile sipping a cup of coffee with cream, Ariaou murmured, \"I don't know much about him, even his name; I call him Tarnkappe for his cloak and the way he appears and disappears mysteriously. Sometimes he tells the future. One time it saved me from a horrible crash that killed seventeen people. The last time he said I'd be getting a letter from Ryme-- and so I did.\"\n\"An innovative approach, making your own prophecies come true. It must save tremendously on worries,\" the Dragon Queen mused over a cup of Elysian herbal tea held delicately in two claws. \"Has he ever explained to you why he helps you in this way?\"\nAriuo considered that, taking a biscuit and nibbling delicately on its flakey edges. \"Long ago, he told me that he was an old friend of the family from long ago. He never explained how; in fact, he's never said more than a few words at any time, but he seems to know more about me than I do.\"\n\"Intriguing. Tsk, but I forget my manners. Allow me to introduce the exiled Prince Gavar Mordenkainen of Hellsgate. The honored dignitary has been badgering me all month about permission to visit the ruins.\" Mirdis chuckled to herself, a deep rumbling sound.\nTarnkappe bowed ironically, a gesture returned warily by Ariaou and Zephyr, then nodded gravely. \"My request for a permit for two to enter site fifteen of the ruins? I should like to depart by midnight.\"\n\"Postponed,\" the Dragon Queen said briskly. \"There will be no ships bound for Ryme within the next three days.\"\n\"I had heard the shuttle `Octave Black' was to depart in three hours?\"\n\"The crew's enjoying stationside recreation while the technicians give the drive systems a much needed overhaul. `Octave Red' is held on Ryme because of a reported bomb threat.\"\n\"There is too little time,\" Tarnkappe muttered to himself.\n\"On the contrary, there's all the time in the world,\" Mirdis replied. \"The ruins certainly aren't going to get up and walk away. Your stationside expenses here including quarters will be covered by Ryme; come back and talk to me in four days, and I'll arrange the permit and transportation personally. Now do enjoy your stay here on `Quiet Reason'.\"\nAriaou and Zephyr nodded, sensing the unofficial meeting was at an end. They turned about and departed as Tarnkappe vanished in his own mysterious way, the feline looking back in time to see Mirdis move the golden queen to place the king in check.\nThree hours passed. Zephyr located her friends in the seventh level conference room and persuaded Ariaou to play dance music for them. Then Ariaou's sweet voice led them in several folk ballads, unifying their voices into a single grand chorus. Food and drink flowed freely from the dispensers, and the dignitaries conversed amiably with each others.\nZephyr had to drag Ariaou out of the party as station time approached midnight; they walked back to their quarters, sweat beading down the centaur's chestnut brown horsehide. The feline purred softly with tail and whiskers held high in such good humor that Zephyr teased, \"See, I told you that you'd enjoy meeting them. Not such stodgy and pompous bureaucrats, are we?\"\n\"Indeed,\" Ariaou said with a quiet laugh. \"I'd never imagined that an angel could have impure thoughts, let alone know all the lyrics to 'The Thing with All the Eyes and the Asteroid Miner's Daughter'.\"\n\"One of my oldest friends and a perennial scandal to her homeworld,\" Zephyr replied with a grin. She palmed the lock and the door to their stateroom irised open, revealing a familiar grey-cloaked figure within.\n\"Elements!\" Zephyr sighed. \"Is everyone following us today?\"\n\"It lacks but half an hour of midnight,\" Tarnkappe said, ignoring the looks of slight exasperation they gave him. \"We have little time if we are to be off the station by then.\"\nThe centaur protested, \"There won't be an atmosphere-capable ship ready for two days yet!\"\n\"There is one now. The personal cruiser of the Coordinator.\"\n\"What gall,\" the centaur grumbled. \"Ariaou?\"\nShe nodded slowly. \"'Tis now, or wait upon Mirdis's pleasure.\"\n\"Now or never,\" Tarnkappe said helpfully. \"I will not wait.\"\n\"That decides that,\" Zephyr said. \"Let's get changed into sensible planetside clothes, Ariaou. Prince Gavar, if you'd be so kind and give us some privacy?...\"\nFifteen minutes later, Zephyr cantered and Ariaou walked to the spaceport cavern, both dressed in plain and serviceable blue kelvarite planetside clothes, a material that maintained a comfortable temperature and humidity in a wide range of environments and afforded protection from sharp objects. Tarnkappe strode along in the same grey cloak, apparently unconcerned about any danger.\nTarnkappe led them through the central elevator that ran through the core of `Quiet Reason'. He entered a control code into a heavily armored airlock that irised open to reveal the null gravity pressurized repair and refueling dock surrounding the Dragon Queen's personal cruiser `Fool's Mate', a sleek black-winged shape equally at home in deep space or within planetary atmosphere.\nTwo guards stood in front of the catwalk leading to the airlock, dressed in station security uniforms and carrying needle rifles slung over their shoulders. The closer one called out, \"Who's there? Identify yourself!\"\nTarnkappe stepped forward as they leveled their guns and shouted for him to halt. His arms blurred into motion almost too fast to be seen; razor-sharp claws clicked out from his fingers, slashed left and right efficiently, and the guards fell away gurgling horribly, throats cut and blood drifting in slow spheres. He cycled the yacht's airlock open as if nothing had happened and beckoned for them to enter.\nThey stepped nervously past Tarnkappe, entering the forward half of the passenger compartment, and settled into soft padded anti-acceleration seats. Ariaou whispered urgently to Zephyr, watching Tarnkappe anxiously, \"That's the same way my brother Tommiau was murdered three years ago.\"\n\"We're stuck with playing this round out,\" Zephyr replied quietly. \"You didn't bring a weapon, did you? Luckily I always keep my sidearm.\"\nTarnkappe gave no signs of noticing their whisperings as he went forward to the pilot's seat and initiated the departure sequence, his long fingers skimming across the banks of controls. The station's com band came alive with protests of unauthorized departure and unfiled flight plans, all of which he blandly ignored. Mirdis's yacht hummed as its engines powered up slowly.\n`Fool's Mate' lifted off silently on compressed hydrogen jets from the support gantries, refueling and repair arms snapping and falling free. The docking bay depressurized, air vanished through powered fans, and the exit hatch opened silently into deep space. Tarnkappe floated the yacht out slowly and deliberately, then started making preparations for the first boost out of the docking cavern and away from the station.\nA voice crackled over the military band, causing Tarnkappe to scrabble surprisedly for nonexistent weapons controls. \"The station's weapons are locked onto you, `Fool's Mate'. Repeat, our guns are locked on you. Do not attempt to leave station orbit. You are charged with two counts of first degree murder, grand theft, failure to file a flight plan or authorization with traffic control--\"\n\"Oh hush, dear Captain,\" a low rumbling reply came from behind them. \"It's my yacht and I wrote the rules, so I can take it out when I need to. Do be a dear and take care of the paperwork for me, will you?\"\n\"Understood, Coordinator,\" the voice replied as Ariaou and Zephyr turned about to gape at the familiar ancient bronze dragon that filled the rear passenger space. \"`Quiet Reason' station over and out.\"\n\"How did you know we would be here?\" Ariaou asked.\n\"As I'm sure Prince Gavar knows already, my yacht was the only one that he could obtain which could safely make it to Ryme within his time limit.\" Mirdis turned to look reprovingly at Tarnkappe. \"Really, though, killing the guards was a bit much. The paperwork for that will run up more than the rest of this put together.\"\n\"They were unimportant,\" Tarnkappe replied as he examined the unfamiliar astronavigation controls. Slight irritation became evident in his gestures as lights blinked and starmaps flickered on and off despite his efforts.\n\"As ever, you ignore all but your grand schemes. Even the smallest thing can count.\" The Dragon Queen reached forward to start the autopilot, which obediently began to follow its preprogrammed course with an efficiency that clearly annoyed Tarnkappe.\nHe dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand, intently studying the new information coming onto the displays. \"I advise you all to brace yourselves, as we will be entering jump in thirty seconds, thanks to lady Mirdis's thoughtful preparations.\"\n`Fool's Mate' accelerated to near lightspeed on anti-matter engines, its artificial gravity protecting its passengers from being smeared against the aft bulkheads by G-force. Its warpspace vanes unfolded into position, long sheets of multiple mirror-bright panels reflecting the light of the receding station. With a sudden jolt, they transited into warpspace. A sense of unreality swept through the yacht.\nThe yacht emerged scant seconds later only ten minutes flight from the glowing sphere of Ryme that now hung suspended before the forward viewport. `Fool's Mate' folded its vanes and cut cleanly into the atmosphere under the autopilot's directions, atmospheric friction heating up its nose and bottom to a cherry bright glow. It glided over thick forest, its wings dissipating excess heat in the cool winds, then descended into the crater of an extinct volcano on compressed air jets.\nTarnkappe stepped out first. Ariaou and Zephyr cautiously followed, and Mirdis disentangled herself from the yacht last. They stood before an architectural magnificence, white marble sprawling within the crater's expanse, largely overgrown by vines and trees. The outermost walls had fallen long ago, sharp-cut stone blocks half buried in the soft earth; arches and gates still stood within the inner courtyards. The setting sun cast golden rays on the roofs.\nTarnkappe led them on a slow walk into the ruins through ancient moss-covered atriums reminiscent of prehistoric Rome. Ariaou unslung her harp and struck up an ancient requiem, slow and sweet notes like tides on the vast sea, the music echoing quietly from the distant corners like a second voice. Zephyr flicked an ear to listen, smiling slightly.\n\"This place might have been built in an hour, the summer palace of some far voyaging human who desired to live planetside a while,\" Mirdis commented from behind them, her black opal eyes unreadable. \"Yet it's lasted the millenniums since Ragnarok, the humans' civil war that laid waste all their worlds. Only a few of their race survived, and none to this day. A shame.\"\nThey stepped into a still intact building, the smooth marble walls only slightly green with moss, the ceilings high and arching to a thin line over their heads. Zephyr's steady clip-clop echoed back weirdly from the corners and Ariaou's music took on new and disturbing resonances, portending strange and mysterious things. Tarnkappe directed them unhesitatingly, knowing exactly where to go.\nMirdis continued, \"The dragons' oldest legends claim that many of the Compassionate, those who freed our people so long ago, survived with what little technology they could preserve. They willingly gave up their humanity to assume heraldic forms of great power, so that they could join our societies and watch over us. It's said that one Guardian single-handedly ended the war between Azhanti and Weyrhelm. A fairy tale for young dragons seeking protectors greater than themselves.\"\n\"The story is correct,\" Tarnkappe conceded reluctantly as they halted in a high-domed vault that held an ivory mausoleum. Gilt plaques lined the walls, carved with ancient writing. \"Very shortly we will meet one of these guardians. The inscriptions tell of Sundancer and his wife Alysse Italy whom he married in the last echoes of human civilization's glories. When Ragnarok fell, she fled the battles in shame at the destructions she'd caused, and built her home on this distant world to live out her days. He visits this place once every century, mourning.\"\n\"So,\" Mirdis rumbled to herself thoughtfully. \"You violated this place, rather than wait upon a permit. As I guessed, Ariaou is important to your plans somehow. But why?\"\n\"Revenge.\"\nThe exiled Prince Gavar pulled his hood back, removed the dark veil that hid his face. Ariaou gasped in recognition, seeing the glowing yellow eyes that haunted her worst nightmares, the grey fur now white with age. \"A dire wolf!\" she breathed, her paws falling from her harp.\n\"A genetic madness haunts my line,\" Gavar explained. \"Each son in turn is stricken, reduced to unthinking bestiality. I was old when I fell ill, and exiled from my homeworld to a distant forest where I might hunt as I wished, so that no outsider would know the shame my family endured.\"\n\"Then the unicorn came, the one with a pelt like sunfire, and slayed me. But dire wolves are not so easily killed. I healed slowly, and when I awoke again, my thoughts were clear.\"\n\"It was an unwanted gift. As a pure wolf, I had known the joy of the wild hunt, the companionship of the pack, the bliss of mating. But I knew these things were wrong, and so I was ashamed. I swore to kill those who witnessed my shame. I killed Tommiau, three years ago. Here I will kill you, and the unicorn, and then there shall be none who know. Then I shall grant myself the peace of death.\"\n\"Peace I brought my wife so long ago,\" a voice like warm twilight said from behind the mausoleum. The golden unicorn Ariaou remembered stepped out, his sky blue eyes shining with ancient sadness and remembrance. \"She would have laid waste your fledgling worlds, driven mad with loneliness and anger, and so I was forced to kill her.\"\n\"She lives,\" Gavar said with a wild laugh. \"She hungers for your blood as much as I.\" He threw away the grey cloak, revealing a grizzled frame better muscled than any dire wolf had a right to be, covered with a silvery grey cloth that shimmered and flowed with sentient light. Razor-sharp claws snicked out from his fingers as he assumed a battle stance.\n\"Grave robber! You have violated her crypt!\" the unicorn neighed, his voice a mighty bell ringing. \"I could not bear to utterly extinct her mind from this plane of existence, and so I transferred it to the weave of her clothes, which you now wear.\"\n\"And which grants me powers like a god's, the power to slay!\" With that, Gavar's suit flared into sudden star-like intensity, then released its energy in a bolt of lightning that blew the mausoleum apart in a shower of stone shards and ancient relics as Sundancer dodged aside. Shrapnel shattered Ariaou's crystal harp, sending its brittle pieces falling harmlessly against her kelvarite clothes. She gasped and stumbled closer to Zephyr.\nWith a sudden flicker, Sundancer teleported behind Gavar, lashed out with a gleaming sharp hoof. Gavar blocked it, his suit deflecting the blow harmlessly, and returned a vicious backhand swipe that gouged the wall. The unicorn raised a defensive aura of dim orange in time to absorb a second lightning bolt, which dissipated in harmless pyrotechnics, then skittered back before the wolf's lunge.\nAriaou staggered upright, holding onto Zephyr for support. Out of the corners of her eyes, she saw Zephyr about to pull something out of her belt pouch; Mirdis laid a cautionary claw on the centaur's forearm, clearly signalling `wait'. The battle raged on, the golden unicorn dancing back before the wolf's furious attack.\nSundancer stumbled back before a sudden glittering arc of metal, taking a fatal cut through his left foreleg, gushing arterial blood, then falling heavilly against the wall. Unable to dodge, he summoned up all his energies to drive his aura up through the spectrum to a glaring blue, then to blindingly intense white, as Gavar hailed lightning against his protective shield. \"Ariaou,\" he called, desperately. \"I need your help! Sing!\"\n\"My crystal harp was broken,\" she wailed back, looking despairingly at the shards of her instrument. Gavar flicked an ear, but continued keeping the wounded unicorn pressed back; Sundancer did not reply, the golden unicorn's energy fading fast, his shield dropping down from white to blue under the force of the wolf's energy blasts.\nAriaou cast about for an instrument, tail lashing to express her fear, ears laid back. She saw an ancient shimmerlyre of unfamiliar design flung loose in the destruction of the mausoleum, against the far wall. It seemed an eternity away, meters of space across which Gavar might kill her with but a negligent blow.\nThe feline gave Zephyr and Mirdis a helpless look for an endless moment, flicked her ears forward agitatedly, then threw herself into a forward dive. She barely evaded a lazy claw swipe that whistled overhead and scooped up the instrument, raising it like a shield.\nIts first note was magic, born of a lyre that had been old when the Owned People were born. Her voice joined it in sweet harmony, her paws lifting up to spin the soft, gentle, reassuring strains of a lullaby, the words coming to her unbidden, full of meaning even though she knew none of them. The shimmerlyre transformed her song to music worthy of the gods, soothing and warm, a golden skein that weaved about the room.\n\"Alas,\" an unfamiliar voice cried out, the contralto voice of a human woman, a ghost trapped within the suit and evoked by Ariaou's sweet singing. \"What have I become, that I should strive to slay my beloved, my husband, my unicorn?\"\nGavar fought with his suddenly contrary suit, becoming paralyzed as it refused to move for him, its light fading into a black darker than night. His lightning bolts ceased, leaving the unicorn to fall to the floor in a puddle of blood, the shield almost spent. Gavar howled defiantly, \"Revenge shall be mine! I command you, my suit!\"\nA sound like repeated mute thunder filled the room, and a row of red dots appeared along his chest. He toppled over slowly like a broken statue, revealing Zephyr standing behind, and Mirdis close to her, nodding approval. The centaur slowly replaced her antique pistol in her pouch, a grim look furrowing her brows beneath marble dust-specked brown hair.\nThe unicorn breathed softly, \"That lyre was my wife's. Now yours, Ariaou. And I bequeath to you my songs as well, for you are worthy.\" With that, Sundancer's body glowed and vanished in a sudden flare of light, leaving behind only the sun-bright spire of his crystal horn. Ariaou turned to see the silver suit fade as well, its weave falling into dust.\n\"The archaeologists aren't going to be happy about this,\" the Dragon Queen commented, looking about the wreckage.\nMuch later, back on the station `Quiet Reason', they went their separate ways. Zephyr returned to the nebular trade conference. Mirdis cleared up the paperwork incurred in their exploits. Gavar's homeworld Hellsgate denied the existence of any exiled Prince Gavar Mordenkainen; the Ryme bureaucracy duly made out the forms and filed it away.\nMirdis and Ariaou met once again in the same conference room, near the chess board the Dragon Queen had been studying on their arrival. They spoke for a short while over tea. Finally, Mirdis rumbled, \"Then there is nothing I can do to persuade you to remain? Our scientists could undoubtedly learn much from Sundancer's horn.\"\n\"Nothing. I must return to Meetpoint, Mirdis,\" Ariaou replied quietly. \"Call it fate, perhaps, or a duty to be fulfilled.\"\n\"Very well. From Zephyr, reservations for a first class suite on the starliner `Princess's Favor'. And I give you this to remember Ryme.\" The Dragon Queen picked up an orange-streaked marble piece from the chess board. At first Ariaou thought it was the pawn; then she looked closer to see that it was a unicorn rampant with eyes of glittering sapphire.\nConrad Wong is a CS student at U. C.

They had crept into their hiding place two hours earlier as the sun had set on the opposite side of the valley. Their rover lay on the other side of the hill in the ravine that had broken its axle. The village was designated PA-40 on their maps, and there appeared to be at least one infant present.\nEmilia spoke first. \"When do you think they'll get a copter in for us?\"\n\"A couple of days unless we ask for an emergency recall,\" Wells replied. \"We'll just sit tight and get some data on the village. When the copter comes we can snatch the children.\"\n\"They're being careful. At least four guards on the perimeter.\" Emilia handed the nightscope to Wells.\n\"A careful barbarian is still a barbarian.\"\nEmilia's hand moved to cover the tic at the corner of her left eye as she heard the stupid schoolboy expression, and she wondered how Wells had managed to rise to the rank of captain.\n\"You like your work, don't you?\" she asked knowing it would put him on edge. Wells regularly filed reports to headquarters about her aberrant behavior.\n\"I like making a contribution to what's left of humanity,\" Wells said slowly, quoting a speech he had once heard. \"You should understand the importance of our word better than me.\"\nJust as Emilia had managed to see Wells' mission reports when at base, he had read her confidential files. He knew, and mentioned at least once each mission, that she had been a barbarian child. Wells had come from the ruins of Montreal, and he prided himself on being a real Canadian. When Emilia had been reluctant to kill a barbarian high on ergot from some bad wheat just outside of Windsor, he knew there was something wrong with her and broke into the files when they got back to the base. Several more missions went by before Wells let slip that he knew Emilia's background. They had been hunting barbarian infants near the Hudson River when Emilia tried to make conversation with her disinterested partner. She mentioned playing in the woods as a child, and Wells carelessly replied, \"You mean near here?\" There was a long silence before Emilia answered, \"No. I don't remember that childhood.\"\nWhat Emilia remembered most about her childhood was that she was not permitted to call her adoptive parents by any of the familiar names that the other children used; to her, they were always Reverend and Mrs. Standish. Reverend Standish had a small parish on an island in the Slave Bear Lake. While the other sterile women in the community lived active, varied lives, Mrs. Standish chose to live the way fertile women were forced to live. She remained at home to care for the house and Emilia, she was always available for babysitting, and she had remained married to the Reverend until her recent death. The young Emilia spent most of her time sneaking out of the house to avoid lessons in music, dance, and cooking. She preferred to run in the woods and swim in the lake. Sometimes, when that thin, quiet woman looked at her in a certain way, Emilia knew that Mrs. Standish blamed her for the absence of natural children in the family. The barbarian girl was a constant reminder of the source of the poisons that made her sterile.\nWells was still scanning the village with the nightscope, so Emilia picked up her rifle and did the same with her weaker, mounted sight. Slowly, so Wells would not notice, she swung her rifle from the village to the surrounding countryside. The area had once been part of the middle Atlantic United States, and Emilia recalled pictures she had seen during a briefing that showed the land covered by enormous trees and filled with deer, bear, and other animals. Now the land was covered by scrub brush, and people who grunted like animals instead of speaking a proper language grew stunted crops in the rocky, worn out soil. To the north, lay an eroded plateau with its steep ravines and flattened hills, but here the valley was wide and the hills rolling. A river fed by cold, narrow streams flowed through the valley. Emilia remembered the forests she had played in as a child. The trees had seemed enormous to her little girl eyes, but she had learned in school that they were only reminders of what once had been. She focused her scope, and her rifle, on the village fields. This was a large settlement by barbarian standards, several dozen huts were grouped around a central square, and its plantings were ambitious. Emilia wondered why the village was so large, and she wished it a silent good luck. She knew it would never grow enough food or produce enough children to endure. The large village with its wide fields was doomed long before she and Wells arrived to steal their children.\nLike Emilia, those stolen infants would be taken north where they would be adopted by some of the many sterile couples that filled the waiting lists. They would be brought up with all the comforts that society and their new parents could provide. Many would never even know that they had been born in a barbarian hut.\nOnly once had Mrs. Standish treated Emilia as her daughter. Whenever each child reached puberty, he or she was tested for fertility. With so few fertile individuals left, it was imperative that they be identified and urged or, when necessary, required to procreate. Emilia's classmates began to report for fertility testing at age twelve. One by one, as they reached puberty, they made the trip across the lake to the city of Providence. Most returned to the island disappointed; a few returned in tears. Once, a young girl named Rachel failed to return to school. It was rumored that she had been found fertile and married a wealthy merchant that same afternoon. A few weeks later, Emilia learned that the girl was sterile and had jumped into Slave Bear Lake and drowned.\nThere was one fertile woman on the island. Mrs. Mackenzie was the wife of the town mayor; she was 25 and had four children. She was in good health, so she could expect to have at least four additional children and perhaps many more before she would have filled her obligation to society and could stop. Other women did things, some even did things with their adopted children, but Mrs. Mackenzie stayed home and nursed her youngest. The mayor's wife had as many lines on her face as did the 50 year old Mrs. Standish.\nAs each month went by, Mrs. Standish had become more optimistic about the chances for Emilia to be fertile. It was a commonly held belief that the later menstruation occurred, the more likely the girl would be fertile. Emilia became increasingly apprehensive. Four years had gone by since the first of her classmates had made the trip to the clinic in Providence before Emilia awoke to find her pajamas soaked with blood.\nWhen Mrs. Standish came into Emilia's room to see why she was late for breakfast, Emilia tried to pretend everything was normal. \"It's just a stomach-ache,\" she said.\n\"Let me feel your stomach.\" Mrs. Standish had grown suspicious of every one of Emilia's aches and pains.\nThe older woman would not be put off. Finally, Emilia begged, \"Please, don't make me go to the clinic. Please.\"\nMrs. Standish could not contain her excitement. \"If we hurry, we can catch the morning ferry. This is a big day girl! Get some clothes on.\"\nEmilia stalled as long as she could, but Mrs. Standish was determined to make it to the ferry. She pushed her adopted daughter out the door before her boots were tied, and they made it to the ferry fifteen minutes before it was scheduled to leave.\nThe trip to the city was uneventful. Once the ferry was on its way, Mrs. Standish moved to the bow and watched for Providence. Emilia moved to the stern and stared at her trees and fields, certain that she would not see them again. The only other passengers on the boat were a group of men selling manufactured goods to the islanders. They seemed to know where Emilia was going; they elbowed each other and whispered, but none tried to talk to her.\nWhen the boat docked, Emilia thought of running. But there was nowhere to run. The men were watching her, the city was unfamiliar, and Mrs. Standish put her hand on Emilia's arm. \"The clinic isn't far,\" the woman said. \"We can walk.\"\nThe clinic was a low, gray cinder block building. As Emilia and Mrs. Standish approached it, passers-by would turn their heads and watch the two. In front of the building, another young woman, older than Emilia, was exiting a taxi. The girl looked like Emilia's opposite: tall, slim, well dressed with pale skin and dark hair. She was accompanied by a stout, matronly woman who was dabbing at her eyes with a kerchief.\nThe lobby was filled with plants and low couches. On the far side, a young boy was curled up in a chair near the wall. The doctor had only taken a few minutes with Emilia; waiting for the results seemed to go on for hours. The other girl had arrived before Emilia, and she got her results first. When the doctor spoke with her, in a glass-walled office just behind the receptionist, she broke down. Her cries reverberated throughout the clinic, drowning out even her mother who could be seen waving her arms at the doctor. A security guard had to be summoned from the bowels of the building to escort the doctor out of the room. The mother and daughter were left inside to exhaust themselves. The girls cries had turned into steady sobs when the doctor finally approached Emilia. The look on his face told the outcome of the tests, and now Mrs. Standish began to sob softly. Emilia did not speak to the doctor, but instead, got up and headed for the exit as soon as the news was official. Mrs. Standish hurried to catch up. The boy was still in his chair.\nEmilia and her adoptive mother reached the dock well before the evening ferry was scheduled to leave for the islands. Mrs. Standish unwrapped a sandwich she had made that morning and ate it quietly. Emilia fed her's to the gulls. The trip home was equally quiet. Emilia hung over the railing near the bow and felt the spray on her face. The older woman dozed under a blanket in the covered passenger area. It was dark when they arrived on the island.\nReverend Standish was smoking a pipe in the living room when Emilia entered the house. She stepped aside to let in her adoptive mother. \"Well,\" the Reverend asked his wife. \"How did she do?\"\nMrs. Standish sighed. \"She failed. But she took it well.\"\n\"I thought she would fail. Barbarians live closer to the poisons than do we. It's a waste of time to even test them.\"\nEmilia felt her throat tighten and the tears well up behind the dam she had built with her mind. Blindly, she groped for the door and, flinging it open, dashed out into the night.\nThe night was cool and the grass was damp. Emilia ran up the hill to the tall maple she had climbed so often as a child. Panting now, she collapsed at the base of the familiar tree and began to cry. She thought of what she could not have, what she had thought she did not want, and she cried. Slowly, she became aware of someone standing over her. She turned and through her tears she saw Mrs. Standish looking older than she had ever looked before. The thin, old woman put her hand on the girl's arm and, as Emilia's sobs turned to heaves and hiccups, Mrs. Standish held her close and cried too.\nWells nudged Emilia and handed her the nightscope. \"Keep an eye on that guard down below. He keeps looking up here. I'm going to take a leak.\"\nEmilia put down her rifle and the valley went black. She blinked rapidly to clear her eyes. There was a slight reddish glow from one of the huts in the village, a small fire spilling through the cracks in the wall, but everything else was in darkness. She brought the scope up to her eyes and, as it began to magnify the available starlight, the village became visible again. As Wells crept quietly out of the shelter, Emilia focused on the guard that was looking in their direction. He could not possibly see the PIP team in the dark, but the way he stared in their direction was unsettling.\nIf the barbarian guard was not looking for them, maybe he was looking for someone else. \"Captain,\" Emilia whispered. \"There might be others out there.\" The only response was a heavy grunt of pain. Emilia grabbed her rifle and dived out of the small cave. Her knees scraped against rock as she turned to see Wells doubled over with a spear through his gut. Dark shapes moved toward her and she fired. She cursed herself for leaving her other gun in the cave. The rifle was equipped to fire only tranquilizer darts, but the pistol fired nine millimeter hollow points. She had unbuckled it for comfort, and now it lay on the other side of the dark figures. Two of the shapes fell before a third hit Emilia on the head with a thrown rock. She fell backward down the slope, blood flowing into her eyes. As she tried to bring her rifle back up to firing position, there was a small explosion at the back of her head. Fighting the pain, Emilia hit the emergency recall beacon on her belt before surrendering to the darkness.\nEmilia regained consciousness slowly. She tried to roll over, but ropes bound her. She was not lying down but was tied to an upright post that pushed at her spine. Her swollen eyes opened, then closed again in reaction to the bright sun. \"Stop, think,\" she told herself. \"What happened to the team?\" She went over in her mind the events of the previous night. Her body shuddered as she pictured Wells tugging at the spear that ran through his stomach.\nHer eyes opened again. She was tied to a post in the middle of a barbarian village. The crude huts that surrounded her looked like the ones she had observed the night before through her nightscope but all barbarian villages seemed to look the same. She looked down at herself, and finally realized she was naked and bruised. Her captors had not been gentle when tying her up.\nA dirty youth peered out of the doorway to one of the huts. He stared at Emilia lustfully until he realized she was awake. Then, jabbering in the barbarian language that Emilia had never learned, he ran through the village. Quickly, people began to converge on the clearing. From the huts and fields they came until the central square was filled with a hundred people or more, and Emilia was surrounded.\nA tall, gray haired man to whom the others deferred approached her. He took a spear from a younger man, and poked Emilia in the belly with the blunt end of the weapon. \"I don't understand,\" Emilia said. The headman spoke again in his language; he had a rich, deep voice. Emilia's mouth was dry and her throat tight. Her eye began to twitch. She had raided dozens of villages and fought countless fights, but she had never felt this close to death. Her shoulders sagged under the ropes and she repeated herself. \"I don't understand.\" The words scratched as they came out.\nThe man turned from Emilia and spoke to the crowd. A moment later, the onlookers pulled away from their prisoner and a group of young men armed with spears stepped into the cleared area. The men ringed the bound soldier and began to circle. As they moved, their spears jabbed closer and closer to Emilia's skin. From the crowd, a low chanting began. Emilia straightened her back, readying herself for whatever was to come.\nAs the spear tips began to scratch Emilia's skin, an old woman burst through the circle of warriors and collapsed at Emilia's feet. The men stopped in confusion, and the crowd fell silent. The only sound in the still morning air was the wailing of the old woman. The headman stepped forward and spoke sharply to the crone. When that failed to move her, he came closer and grabbed her shoulders. The old woman shook him off and keened louder, and the crowd began to talk excitedly. The headman turned and called forward a young woman. She knelt beside the old woman and spoke softly, placing an arm around her in comfort. The woman's wails trailed off, and she spoke to the young woman between sobs. When the old woman stopped speaking, she broke down again and cried at Emilia's feet. The young woman looked carefully at the prisoner before speaking with the headman.\nThe village chief grabbed the old woman roughly and peered closely at her face. He then turned to Emilia and studied her face before grunting to himself. With a wave of the headman's hand, Emilia found herself being cut free. She was pushed into a nearby hut, and her clothes were thrown in after her.\nAfter dressing and checking to make sure the barbarians had not left any weapons with her clothes, Emilia assessed her situation. Something the old woman had said had led to her being spared, at least for the time. Was it something in her face? Could anyone recognize her this far south? After all these years?\nLost in thought, Emilia did not hear the old woman until she had entered the hut. She was carrying a bundle which she set on the dirt floor. While speaking affectionately in her own language, the woman stroked Emilia's cheek, Emilia replied as best she could. She tried to tell the old woman that she could not be her daughter, that it had been too long, that she was now a child of the north. The old woman shrugged and cooed.\nThe bundle contained a long skirt and shirt made from tanned deer hides. When Emilia put them on, the old woman smiled in appreciation. Hours passed before the chief came for the old woman. As she left, Emilia saw tears on her cheeks and felt her own eyes fill.\nEmilia was awakened by the sound of copters. In her sleep, she cursed the early morning flights on which headquarters insisted. Then, realizing where she was, she jumped to her feet. At the doorway, a guard grabbed her arm and together they stared up into the noonday sun. Canadian gunships were circling the village. Some were preparing to land in the cleared area where Emilia had been tied, and barbarians were running to the square with spears and clubs in their hands.\nThe Canadian soldiers leaped from the copters and formed a tight phalanx bristling with SMGs. From a loudspeaker mounted on one of the gunships, a voice called out, \"We are looking for Captain Wells and Lieutenant Emilia Standish. Turn them over and no one will be hurt.\" The sound echoed off the hill where Emilia had hid with Wells, and the crowd looked at the copters in confusion.\nEmilia stood transfixed, the guard at her side forgotten, as someone in the crowd of villagers threw a spear. It landed in the group of soldiers, striking no one, but the soldiers panicked. Emilia shouted out at them to hold their fire, but her voice was drowned out. A withering burst of automatic weapons fire spat out at the tightly packed crowd and the battle was on.\nThe barbarians with their crude spears and wooden shields never stood a chance against the Canadian soldier's auto-weapons and battle armor. In a matter of minutes, the village square was filled with barbarian bodies and the survivors were fleeing to the hills. The old woman who had befriended Emilia was trying to make her way across the battleground to Emilia when she was caught in the crossfire. A badly thrown spear struck her in the leg and, as she went down, a well placed burst from an SMG nearly severed her neck.\nThe barbarian that had been at Emilia's side fled. A Canadian soldier looked across the bodies to Emilia. She tried to make eye contact, but all she could see was his tinted visor. He swung his rifle into firing position and casually squeezed off a burst that chewed through the door of the hut. Emilia tried to call out to him but the roar of the copters was too loud. The next burst ripped through the wattle and daub wall of the hut just above Emilia's head. Emilia tensed to run, but the next burst was in the ground at her feet, kicking clods of dirt up onto the deer hide skirt. The fourth burst was aimed at Emilia's chest.\nAs the soldier squeezed out that last burst of bullets, the gray haired headman scrambled around the corner of the hut and tackled Emilia to the ground. The two were sprayed with bits of stick and dried mud as the front wall of the hut disintegrated.\nThen the headman was up and pulling at Emilia's arm. He pushed her pistol into her hand, and then they were off. The soldier pulled again at the trigger, but he had wasted his clip. Emilia and the headman sprinted through the village, dodging between huts to avoid the soldiers, and trailing the rest of the villagers.\nFrom a rocky outcropping on the hill overlooking the village, Emilia and the rest of the barbarians watched the Canadian soldiers systematically search and then destroy each hut. As her home burned, Emilia unconsciously disassembled and cleaned her pistol. She thought about what Wells had said: \"I like making a contribution to humanity.\" And she finally, silently agreed.\nThe sun set, all red and gold, behind them, and Emilia heard a child start to weep.\nMaurice Forrester lives in Syracuse with his wife, Lori, and three year old son, John.

It's time. I can remember everything about that day, even those words. It was a beautiful evening, and the three of us had spent the afternoon talking and quarreling, drowsing in the warm summer of the Greenland veldt. Even then, we felt the cool shadow of our friend, the fourth of us, who sat, mute and alone, beneath a tree. Always with us, as we have always been together; but now he was his own statue, a supple monument to remind the three that remained. We had been together for five years before he became thus, an artist whose passion for infinite madness was so soon rewarded.\nI walked over to the tree, and bent over to hold his hand. He blinked, and I crouched down beside him, putting my head next to his, aligning, looking where he looked. Then we stood up, silently, slowly, his hand holding tight as he caught sight through my eyes. I matched him pace for steady pace, holding my head as he held his. The tower was a kilometer distant, towards the sea's edge, and we looked at the delicate black-web bowl that pointed at the sky, ready for the night.\nAs we walked towards it, watching our friends running ahead, getting to the tower while we were still ten minutes away, I wondered what he really saw, whether he was still wandering the chaotic caverns of the old machines. If he wasn't, did he see us as friends still, who kept him close and part of the old team, took him with us wherever, played and talked to him?\nSometimes, I thought he must hate us for so constantly taunting him, now and again making him hear our shouts and chatter and laughter like today, reminding him what he has lost. And then for me to hold hands like this, linking our illicit links, and looking for him. What it must be to see the world so fitfully, and always through someone else's eyes, a spectator alone. I cannot look at him when we are so linked. I could not, as I could never let myself kiss him.\nWe got to the tower, and as we climbed the first step he let go my hand and walked inside quickly, without hesitation. He knew his way around; we might have built it together but it was always his observatory. He'd all but lived here, amongst the old machines, and one day he'd all but died. I stood there alone, looking at the grey wood walls of the tower against the deep blue evening sky, against the darkening grass and trees, remembering things perhaps I ought not.\nThen I went in, and climbed to the observing room. The other two were already busy, lost in the joy of working the machines, letting them talk to each other and out towards the old satellites that still drew their dutiful paths in the sky above. Tonight was special; across the globe fully half the world was listening to our broadcast, ten million souls linked by the distant sea of the ionosphere above us. Ancestor radio; so long ago the only link between the distances, now the one gift of the machines we cannot give back. Tonight, it reclaims a little more of its old glory and we justify a little more of the faith we had in ourselves a millennium ago.\nNone of us understood those days, for all we talked about them; we couldn't see our mistakes when they were five years from killing us but sent our devices a thousand years into the future. What were we trying to do?\nWhen they sent that starprobe away from Earth, the books say, it was one of the terrible times. There was furious argument about such a wasteful action, when even they could feel their great shining world shaking itself apart. Yet, in the dark and lonely centuries that followed, the mission survived. Even when the last man walked away, he made sure the computers still ran and the starprobe kept its course.\nThen we came along, the four of us, young and bored and full of devilish intrigue. The machinery had not been forgotten, but it was left alone. At first, nobody minded as we tinkered and built, but then we found the links. Those were as forbidden as fire, the old laws ignored purely because nobody thought any remained. Some did; we found them, and the machine that built them into us. One morning we took it in turns to lay down in the coffin and emerge, half an hour later, with wire in our veins and new cold life in our heads.\nOh, it was tremendous. The smooth machines woke under our hands, the black slabs that we'd never understood. We understand them now and the things that live within them; brilliant minds, playful, pleading, offering all the knowledge and beauty of the old days, so compelling and satisfying and so dangerous. That these things were toys, pastimes, given to children, is unbelievable; perhaps if we could understand that, we would know so much more.\nPerhaps that's what he knows, perhaps that's what he found and couldn't let go. He'd not left the machines alone, particularly when he found the music. We'd always thought he'd be a good composer, but, with the machines, he went far beyond; he used them to amplify his designs and produce music that had us in awe. It frightened us, but he seemed so confident, so positive, so blissfully enthralled.\nThen we came into the observatory, ten days after we'd got the links, to find him, apparently asleep, holding on to one of the smooth machines. We woke him up: his eyes opened and he seemed about to say something. Nothing happened. The machines couldn't help; they said he was blind and deaf, but about his mind they said they didn't know. Of course, the families were horrified; we had our links removed and took such punishment as they gave us, but mostly they left us alone.\nSince then, we've stayed here. Ten years. The others didn't replace their links, but I did and he did, and, with a careful, patient learning, I fixed it so that, now and again, he could hear, and, once in a while, I could let him see. I didn't care to use the links other than that, twice since then he's placed his hands on the mission controls and sat, silent as always, feeling the links out into space.\nIt didn't take long after the accident for the story to spread; our occasional shortwave transmissions, politely reporting the progress of the starprobe as it neared its destination, became more and more popular. First, it was just youngsters, probably because we were perverse heroes due to the terrible things we'd done, but in a quiet world not used to novelty we provided a certain fascination. Lately, we'd started giving talks about the mission and its history as well as charting its course, and, once or twice, we'd even had a visitor.\nNow we were alone; tonight, a hundred years ago, the starprobe could have tugged itself into orbit around a far planet, unfurled its banners and started to pass back what it found to the ghosts of its makers. It might not; it might not have survived the long dark years. We wouldn't know until tonight, us and half the world.\nOut in space, the relay satellites waited, holding their positions in the tracery of electrons like fat spiders waiting in a shining web, binding the Great Net. I know that whatever that is, it works like our black dish on the tower, but stretches across millions of kilometers of emptiness, sifting the ceaseless storm of star-born radio. Somewhere in that is the thin whisper from the starprobe, a hundred light years away, and somehow it's caught and held and passed back to us mundane humans. A gift.\nWe sat in the dark observatory, watching the screens. We took it in turns to give the commentary; he sat in his old chair, hands once again on the smooth machine as if the last ten years were just a daydream. We didn't mention him on air; we never had.\nThe time came, and for a second, two, there was nothing. Then, the screens lit, and our starprobe slowly awoke. We'd stopped reminding the audience that this had all happened a century ago; for us, for everyone, it was happening now.\nIt was a white planet. Cold and huge, bigger than Earth but still a rock, glazed with gas. We saw great drifts of brilliant cloud lit by its distant sun, smooth yet streaked with golden lines. It was placid, so far away from the warmth of the star that only a few huge whorls marked its weather.\nThe starprobe swung around, crossing into night. It was still practicing its ancient senses, and the cameras faded and brightened as it struggled to focus on the planet below. As it passed the terminator, the weatherlines mixed and curdled; something was happening there, but we had to wait hours before we could see it again. All the time we described what we saw, what the other readings were, and made wild guesses.\nThen it came again, and this time the machinery was ready. A thousand pictures taken in a hundred different ways, at every wavelength and every depth. As the probe went into daylight, we began to understand. It was snow, boiling up from vast fields as the starlight warmed it and cooling out as it fell into night. An eternal blizzard: the first snowstorm on Earth in seven centuries.\nThe starprobe, so long ago, felt with other senses. What snow it was, cold chemicals that held the hint that once, an age ago, there had been life on the planet. It was no more than a hint; of something that had passed long before our rich and lively solar system had itself cooled like a snowflake out of the void.\nFour times the starprobe let go tiny passengers, probes that drifted slowly down into the bleak sky below, tunnelling and tasting as they fell through the layers of cloud. We caught our first flake; big as a peacock's tail and lighter than a sparrow's feather. It was a beautiful thing, complex and fragile; it melted as the cameras tracked up and down. On top were crystal facets, clear layers that might almost have been water ice, reflecting the light from the probe; they were set in a mass of sparkling needles that oozed and combined as we watched. Beneath were regular patterns, faint colours, but they too vanished before we could see them properly.\nAs the probes descended, they caught marvelous sights; linked spirals of a thousand big flakes breaking up, recombining. One shattered into a flurry of tiny, glinting particles which scattered like fragments of a glass as it hits the floor; it was far away, and that was all we saw.\nIt was already thirty-six hours since we started, and I was wondering how much longer we could go on for. On the screens, the vast structure of the snowstorms was charted, as varied as a slice through a billion years of rock but dynamic, shifting, a most precise and random dance.\n\"Listen!\"\nWe looked at each other, then at where he sat. He was motionless, hands still on the machine, but there was no doubt that he'd spoken. I ran over, and shook his shoulder; nothing. Then, from the speakers set into the roof, came a blast of noise, not pure like a waterfall, not distinct like birdsong, but as loud and insistent as both.\n\"Listen,\" he said again. \"They're talking. Radio.\"\nHe shuddered, and smiled. We looked at the screens; he was listening to the broad spectrum radio on the starprobe. We'd ignored it. The pictures were so beautiful, and the maps we drew so interesting, that we hadn't even known it was there.\n\"I can tune this,\" he said, \"It's all in layers\"\nThe noise shifted; now a pattern of crashes, like slow waves on a beach heard from a distance, now a swiftly rising arpeggio that slipped in and out of time with the waves and was repeated and varied in a mass of variations, faint, loud, slower, faster, always with purpose.\n\"They're talking... about stars... they're watching them...\"\nI tried to pull one of his hands away, worried. He stiffened, and held on with an animal strength. I looked at the others, and stood back. Nobody was talking on the radio; across the world the sounds of that ancient planet were playing.\n\"It's beautiful! I know what they're looking at...\" He turned and looked at me; I knew he couldn't see the room, but I nearly screamed with shock; his face, so long slack and lifeless, was transformed, his eyes alight with an almost heavenly glee.\n\"Lover-- listen to me\" he said. \"I'm nearly at the edge. I'm not going to break the link. They watch the stars too. They know so much. They know about the starprobe. They thought they were alone and now they're... oh, listen!\"\nThe noise grew clearer. I recognized a spark of music, an echo of his glorious days, but it went beyond that. It was a symphony, perfect, that grew and flowered as unerringly as a rose. We stood there and listened, hardly breathing, caught in the theme, so much his style but carrying a message; vast, majestic, alive.\nBeneath the starprobe, the snowflakes formed and were aware. They caught the light of the stars, and passed the news of each tiny snatch of distant light amongst themselves. A compound eye across quarter of the planet, formed in near-darkness, away from the blinding burn of the sun. They drifted down, changed, reformed, carrying the information, analyzing, perceiving. Each snowflake died in hours, yet the snowstorm lived and thought for ever, watching the universe.\nThe music changed. It was not for ever. It knew how random it was, and how it would perish when the sun got a little brighter or a little colder. It could see such things, it knew so well how a star grew old when its one sure sense was an eye of such power. It thought, for so long, that it was alone.\nThe music changed. The starprobe had arrived. Whoever sent you, the snowstorm said, if you are still alive, you have a companion now. Please talk to me before I end. We must. If you understand me, come.\nWe understood through the music, a performance of virtuoso improvisation that left no room for doubt, that convinced utterly.\nCome.\nThen, he gasped aloud. The music vanished, for a moment the cacophony returned, then a thunderclap of pure, raw, unfeeling noise. We should have been watching the screens, but the music took us over so completely that we hadn't been aware of anything else. A hundred years away, the starprobe crossed the terminator into light, and the edge of the snowstorm was caught in a burning line of chaos. The scream of the tearing apart was carried into the observatory, into the machines, into the link.\nHe was dead.\nWe cannot know, now, whether what he told us was true. It's unthinkable to anyone who heard the music that he couldn't have believed it, but whether he was right nobody can say. The starprobe is still there; we have all the data we want but none of the insight. What he did, what he thought, is lost.\nBut we're coming. Perhaps we needed to rest and brood on our mistakes, perhaps we're wrong now to start again on a road that is so dangerous. I think we know enough, just about, to watch ourselves. This time. Some of us are working on the links, trying to find out what part of his music was genius, what part repeatable. Some of us are reaching out, prodding at those long hundred years between us and the planet; there are ways, we think, to make those years a blink of an eye, ways that the old people would never have thought of.\nAnd now we understand what we must do again.

For example, I had an issue where I forgot to have a Klingon warship decloak before it fired on the Enterprise. That was fair and square--they caught it and it had slipped past both myself and Bob Greenberger, no question. Nor do I mind the self-proclaimed nitpicking changes. It's the vascilation that can get to me. And the contradictions. And the ignoring of Star Trek history. We are told that Star Trek command personnel can never be less- than-sterling characters, despite ``Patterns of Force'' and ``Doomsday Machine'' and ``The Omega Glory'', etc., etc. We are told that we must concentrate almost exclusively on the principle seven characters, but everytime we try and develop a storyline involving those characters (for example, Chekov wanting his own command, or Uhura returning home to visit her family) they are shot down.\nWe are told (honest to God) that a female bridge crewmember I created angered certain people at Paramount because ``women shouldn't be on the bridge crew.''\nWe are told that ``terran'' is an unacceptable term to refer to natives of earth--although Picard used it just the other week. We are told the word ``civilian'' does not exist since Starfleet is non-military--despite the fact that Riker's father was called, several times, a civilian adviser.\nAnd I guess, bottom line, the most frustrating thing is being made to adhere to guidelines even more stringent than the TV show's, and then considered to be second class citizens by the offices at Paramount. We are perfectly okay as a source of revenue, but legitimate Star Trek? ``Real'' Star Trek? Sorry, only the TV and the movies. And not even that. We've done things that were based on concepts or have precedents in third season Trek, the second through fifth films, and the animated, and been told that all of those are not legitimate sources either.\nI understand that Paramount owns Trek. I just don't understand who is calling the shots anymore, or why.\nIn his own words, ``Peter David writes lots of stuff.'' He is and has been involved with the Star Trek comic book series for a number of years. He is the author of the Star Trek: The Next Generation novel _Strike Zone_. His new novel, _Rock and a Hard Place_ should be out sometime in mid 1990.","source-hostname":"Quanta Magazine"}
