She felt the scrubby grass pulse in rhythm with her song. There was a tightness in the air, a sense of expectation. Polyphemus was a Class-4 planet: inhabitable for humans without terraforming, but it did not yet host sentient life-forms. As the planet holistically responded to Wren\u2019s flute, she wondered how true that classification was.\nEverything on Polyphemus was as attuned to sound as she was. The atmosphere of the odd little planet was so dense that little visible light was able to punch through the clouds, shrouding it in perpetual darkness. Sight had not turned out to be a high evolutionary priority. Its flora-fauna instead evolved bio sonar to find their way around. Wren had been recruited twice in her life \u2013 first for the cutting-edge sonar implantation surgery that gave her something like a sense of sight, and then to aid the exploration scientists on Polyphemus. She had no scientific training, no credentials, nothing but her status as a moderately successful medical guinea pig to bring with her to that far-flung planet. At eighteen, she was barely full grown, with only her peculiar experience of life to contribute to the colony, but that was enough. The researchers welcomed her. She became the scrappy mascot of Research Station Three.\nWren\u2019s implanted sonar pinged. The doctors told her before the experimental surgery that the sonar would manifest as a form of vision, but then again, the doctors had all been born with eyes that worked. The implanted sonar was more like a breeze blowing by or a shift in the softness of the ground. Wren had something like a sense of sight, now, but her brain translated those signals into tactile sensations. She felt, rather than saw, Dr. Auden approach. Each of his steps was a gentle wave brushing against her. Everyone\u2019s sonar signature was a little different, marked by idiosyncrasies in the rhythm of their movements, in the length of their strides, in the way they held their hands.\n\u201cHi, Dr. Auden,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI heard you playing.\u201d He spoke softly, with the measured, clipped accent of a colony brat. \u201cDinner is ready. Do you want to eat?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d She packed her flute away and stood up. Polyphemus lay dormant again. Or perhaps it just lost interest. The connection she and the flute had forged with the grass, grass that was also a sort of insect, slipped away.\nBack in the cafeteria of Research Station Three, conversation mingled in the air with the smells of garlicky rations. The scientists had so many questions \u2013 how does the planet have tides without a moon? Polyphemus had no axial tilt, and thus no seasons, and yet the life of the planet waxed and waned like there was a winter and summer and spring. The geologists were still trying to find out why certain regions were rich with life while other sections of the planet were inexplicably barren. It was a strange little planet. It had no valuable resources, it was too dark for the sighted to want to colonize, and it was a long way off from any other inhabited planet. But it was a riddle, like Wren\u2019s perfectly formed but non-functioning eyes had been a riddle. She knew that scientists loved riddles like she loved music. It was the way they understood the world.\nDoc Razza, waved to Wren. Razza was young and agender, and trusted Wren\u2019s sonar more than the others. Ze treated Wren like she could really see, used nonverbals to communicate as much as ze used verbals. Wren sat down beside Razza. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Batty.\u201d Razza had explained bats once to Wren. Some extinct creature from Earth that, like her, were born blind and navigated with sonar. Razza claimed ze\u2019d seen preserved skeletons, but Wren was skeptical. \u201cYou remember that idea I had a while ago?\u201d\n\u201cYou have lots of ideas, Razza.\u201d\n\u201cI mean the project. You know, with me and you. With the different instruments, different forms of music.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Razza handed her a piece of bread. The sonar pinged it, and her hand moved to accept it, simply at the right place at the right time.\n\u201cWe got a care package,\u201d said Razza. \u201cCan you play the guitar?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cTrumpet?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. How do you learn music?\u201d\nWren smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t learn music, Razza. I make it.\u201d\nDoc Razza and Wren wrote the research proposal together in the quiet aftershifts while the rest of the scientists slept. Razza and Wren selected variables: organic vs inorganically produced tones, harmonic vs dissonant chord use, tempo and volume. They identified possible research sites and possible control sites. Razza treated Wren as an expert, as a studied and verified musicologist. The authority ze lent her puffed Wren up with pride. Wren liked that she would be solving a riddle, not that she was the riddle worth solving. She couldn\u2019t stop grinning when the proposal was approved.\nWren and Razza drove out to a lush valley, one of the strange spots on the planet where life abounded. Wren couldn\u2019t see it, but she could feel it. There was a density in that valley unlike anything around Research Station Three. Her sonar pinged close, pinged softly. Noises rolled off the trunks of trees, off the smooth skins of the bulbous plant life that detached from the vines and bounded through the grass like puppies. The plurality of forms there in the valley came back to Wren. It beat against her body like soft rain.\nRazza\u2019s movement marred the stillness. Ze set up the recorders, the computers, the machines to collect all their data in a clattering hurry. \u201cThis is the best spot in Polyphemus, Wren,\u201d Razza said. \u201cJust brimming with life. I wish I could see it all, but it\u2019s too dark, and the fauna-flora hate high-spectrum light. The plantimals\u2013\u201d\nWren laughed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a better name for them,\u201d said Razza.\n\u201cThat sounds ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cOnly to you, only because you expect them to be one or the other. The plantimals retreat, you know, just curl back into their roots and hide out underground. I can smell it, though. Can you?\u201d\nWren could. It smelled heavy and dense, had the hearty pungence of arable land. She could even taste it\u2013the air held a smooth, tangy bitterness like black tea. \u201cI like the way it smells,\u201d said Wren.\n\u201cMe, too. Animants? No. Plantimals.\u201d Razza clicked on the recorder. \u201cTest 1. Alai Razza and Wren Varus present at Site 1, Cradle Valley. Today, we begin research on the effects of extra-terrestrial deliberate tonal patterns on the indigene life forms of Polyphemus. Today\u2019s test is an attempt to quantify and measure what Wren Varus has reported anecdotally.\u201d Razza paused. \u201cHey, Wren?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you report your experiences anecdotally into the recorder? Just so we have an official record.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Wren laughed. Her face grew hot as she took the recorder. \u201cDo I just talk into it? Here?\u201d\n\u201cOther side.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d She flipped it over. The end she was supposed to speak into was covered in a firm, springy metallic mesh. \u201cOk. Huh.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThis is, uh. . . this is Wren Varus. I am a musician. I play music outside Station Three a lot unless I\u2019m needed for sonar research. I play the flute, mostly. I don\u2019t play anything in particular; I just improvise, I guess. And when I\u2019m outside playing the flute, Polyphemus. . .\u201d She groped for a way to explain it. \u201cSomething syncs up. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the plantimals or what, but when I play, something syncs up, and I can feel this global rhythm.\u201d She handed the recorder back to Razza abruptly.\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re going to see if we can measure this synchronization Wren Varus has described. While Wren Varus plays the flute, I will take readings of the bioelectric signatures and the levels of oxygen here in the Cradle. We will record Wren\u2019s song for the sake of completion, though we have agreed that for this run she will improvise the music as she has done in her spare time, to better replicate her experiences.\u201d Razza clicked off the recorder. \u201cYou ready, Batty?\u201d\nWren pulled her flute out of her jacket. Her mouth went dry. Her heart beat fast in her chest: rat-ta-tat rat-ta-tat. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Equipment\u2019s good?\u201d\n\u201cYou look nervous.\u201d\n\u201cI am nervous,\u201d Wren said. She felt a flood of relief in admitting it.\nRazza patted her shoulder. \u201cHey, worst that happens is we don\u2019t pick up anything. Then we just go back to square one. Nothing to be nervous about.\u201d\nBut Wren stayed nervous anyway. It wasn\u2019t the research that worried her, not really. It was this nagging idea that now, when she wanted Polyphemus to respond to her so badly, that it wouldn\u2019t. That this time she\u2019d pick the wrong thread of music, or maybe the right music but in the wrong key, and that she\u2019d just be sitting there playing to a deaf planet. Wren took a breath and squared her shoulders. She sat down and crossed her legs, nestling into the soft grass. She checked a few notes and tuned her flute. She ran through a scale, then an arpeggio, and then a melody swept her up. The music unfolded, revealing itself to her one note at a time, her fingers moving of their own accord like they were privy to something that her mind was not.\nPolyphemus responded. The grass-insects swayed and pulsed in hypnotizing rhythm, their legs rooted, but their wings out and shivering. She, too, felt rooted to that world, like she was part of the grass and vine-trees, like she too was an indigene life form. Polyphemus responded with more fervor than it ever had before. She thought she imagined the percussive creaking at first. Her sonar gave her a feeling of being at sea, of gentle rhythmic rocking.\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d said Razza.\nWren pulled the flute down from her mouth. She felt bounded and separate again; human and foreign again. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cWren, keep playing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026 just play again.\u201d She heard Razza fumble with more equipment, the hard plastic casing clicking and tapping so its hungry sensors could collect the data. Wren played again. She caught the thread of that odd, playful melody easily. She spun it out until she felt the Cradle sync with it. The melody felt like it already existed: it wasn\u2019t something she created so much as something she discovered. Something she synced with first, and it was through her that the life of Polyphemus could sync with it, too. There was, while she played, a joy in it. A relief and an ecstasy of a thing long wanted and only now received. This joy, she was certain, was not from her but from Polyphemus.\nRazza broke the melody with a wild, shocked laugh. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d Razza said again. \u201cWren, how are you making it do that?\u201d\nWren let the music die. \u201cDo what? What\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\u201cYour sonar works. Can\u2019t you see it? The land is\u2026 I don\u2019t know how else to put it, but, Wren, when you played the land danced.\u201d\nWren could make Cradle Valley dance, but only under certain conditions. Recorded music didn\u2019t work, even if it was a recording of a melody that had only just yesterday whipped the land into a frenzy. When she played to the valley live, she only ever got a reaction if she was allowed to play whatever came to mind. It didn\u2019t matter what she played the music with\u2013flute, trumpet, guitar, sung wordlessly\u2013if Wren was allowed to improvise there in the moment the land danced for her. That was enough for Wren, but Doc Razza was a font of endless questions. \u201cHow do you know what to play?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Wren.\n\u201cBatty, you have to know something.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like breathing. Or speaking. Or walking. I can just do it without thinking about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just be plucking this music out of thin air,\u201d said Razza.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you. I\u2019m out there and I just feel it. The rhythm sinks into me from I don\u2019t know where, and then it turns itself into a song. I bet anyone could do it. If you just listened for it, I bet anyone could do it.\u201d\nDoc Razza laughed. \u201cOh, Batty, you are so far from right it hurts. What do you mean the rhythm comes first?\u201d\n\u201cI mean the rhythm comes first.\u201d Razza sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t put it any plainer than that. A rhythm sticks in my mind, and the music forms around it. I mean, have you listened to what we record out there? It\u2019s so rhythmic. Really complex rhythms. It\u2019s percussive stuff. I didn\u2019t used to play like that. I like it, I like the way it sounds, but it\u2019s evolved here. On Polyphemus.\u201d Wren leaned against Razza\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s something in the rhythm, I\u2019m telling you. I wish I could figure it out. I know it\u2019s driving you crazy, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s something in the rhythm.\u201d\nThey pored over the recordings. They narrowed it down to six: six recordings had been made in the Cradle and had made the Cradle dance. They listened to the recordings one after another, layered on top of each other, in different configurations. Over and over they listened, trying to decipher what it was in them rhythmically which set the land moving.\n\u201cMusic\u2019s just math, right?\u201d said Razza, shouting over one recording. \u201cThere has to be some way to narrow this down. Some algorithm or something.\u201d\n\u201cMusic\u2019s music,\u201d Wren said.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s math.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m terrible at math,\u201d said Wren.\n\u201cOr you\u2019re great at it.\u201d\nWren turned down the recording. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. These recordings. It\u2019s weird because the rhythms are different but they\u2019re not dissonant. It\u2019s like points and counterpoints. It\u2019s like we could piece them together and they\u2019d be a whole, but I don\u2019t know which part fits where. But if you listen, sometimes one seeps into another. Sometimes they go to together, and sometimes they split apart. Like different parts of an orchestra.\u201d Wren chewed her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rhythm is there, but I can only play one piece of it at a time. Like it\u2019s this enormously complicated thing I can\u2019t capture all by myself just on one flute. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\u201cIt does to you. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d said Razza.\nThey decided to collect more data. The more data the better, said Razza. They decided to go to a barren spot to see if she could pluck anything out of the air where there was no life. They took one of the cars and drove to Research Station One some three hundred kilometers away. Station Three was overrun with biologists; Station One was a stronghold of physicists and geologists. Still scientists, but not ones whose academic curiosities were piqued by life forms.\nWren fell asleep on the long drive but woke when Razza parked the car outside Station One. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Wren asked.\n\u201cLate,\u201d said Razza. Ze sounded tired. \u201cWay aftershift. They\u2019ve probably already eaten, but Station Three radioed ahead. They\u2019re expecting us. Hopefully they left us some supplies and set up some cots. Here, help me with the equipment.\u201d\nWren and Razza dragged in their recorders and microphones. A young woman met them in the cafeteria and got them situated. Razza asked her endless questions. She was a geologist. She was all the way out from the Home System, just like Wren, though she wasn\u2019t from Earth. She hated to cook. Wren let the conversation wash over her, absorbing it without paying much attention to it. She let the sonar guide her, using Razza\u2019s familiar signature to keep her going the right direction.\nSome of the scientists at Station One were still working. Some doors they passed were open, and Wren caught snatches of technical speech she couldn\u2019t parse. Everything they said sounded too clinical, like a dissection. She wanted to yell at them that the planet wasn\u2019t dead, that it was a world alive, that she knew because she played for it and it danced for her. And then came the rhythm. It was pure rhythm, just a clicking clacking tapping rhythm from an open doorway. She peeled off from Razza and the geologist. She barged into the room from which the clicking clacking rhythm came. Her sonar pinged someone in there, someone sitting at a desk or a terminal. \u201cWhat is this? How did you get this rhythm?\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d It was a harsh voice, deep and gruff and sleep-deprived.\nRazza\u2019s footsteps pounded down the hall. Wren heard zir skid to a halt in the doorway. \u201cWren, what are you\u2013\u201d\n\u201cListen, Razza!\u201d\nThe invaded scientist grumbled. \u201cWe\u2019re from Station Three ,\u201d Razza said quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re just bunking the night. This is Wren; Wren\u2019s blind. She must have come in here by mistake.\u201d\nWren rounded on Razza. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWren\u2013\u201d\n\u201cListen, Razza!\u201d\nRazza tugged at her arm. \u201cWren, come on\u2013\u201d\nWren jerked her arm away. She pointed in the direction from which the gruff scientist\u2019s voice had come. \u201cHe knows something! I am not in here by accident! It has nothing to do with me being blind! Can\u2019t you hear it? It\u2019s the rhythm! All of the rhythms we didn\u2019t know how to put together are pouring out of this room, whole. Razza, this is what I\u2019ve been plucking out of thin air!\u201d\nThe room went silent but for the elusive, shifting rhythm. \u201cOh my god, it is. It\u2019s the rhythm,\u201d said Razza.\n\u201cWhat rhythm? Why are you in my lab?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wren asked. \u201cWhere is it coming from?\u201d\nRazza brushed past her. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re from Station Three .\u201d Wren heard the soft slap of flesh on flesh as the scientists shook hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cChau.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Razza. Alai Razza, biologist. I specialize in botany. Nice to meet you, Chau. What\u2019s your line of work?\u201d\n\u201cAstronomy. What\u2019s all this\u2013\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you studying, Chau? Right now, literally right now, what are you studying?\u201d asked Razza.\n\u201cI\u2019m investigating local celestial bodies in this region of the galaxy.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Right now, what is it that you\u2019re looking at right now. What are those readings you\u2019re getting?\u201d\nChau was silent for a moment. \u201cThe chatter? It\u2019s a pulsar. There\u2019s a pulsar near Polyphemus. PSR L347-1153. This noise is just its signal. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a pulsar?\u201d Wren asked. Her heart leapt into her throat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a star. A rotating neutron star. Its electromagnetic radiation signature is what you\u2019re listening to.\u201d\n\u201cThis. . .the rhythm comes from a star?\u201d Wren asked.\n\u201cYeah, it comes from a star,\u201d said Chau.\nThat was how Wren helped unravel the mystery of Polyphemus. The pulsar was the key. It was a phenomenon unique in known space: the radio signals of PSR L347-1153, the pulsar near Polyphemus, bombarded the planet, and the geographical composition of the planet was such that certain tectonic plates were conductive to the pulsar\u2019s signals. These plates experienced minute shifts in response to the star\u2019s pulses, and those minute shifts manifested as those previously inexplicable tides and seasons. Life forms on Polyphemus evolved to pick up on the subtleties of the pulsar\u2019s staccato radio signals, the better to predict the changes in the land.\nSomething in Wren\u2019s sonar implantation mechanisms made her more attuned to the pulsar\u2019s signals than the other humans on Polyphemus. She had, literally, plucked her music from thin air. PSR L347-1153 sent it to her through the void of dead space, and she took it, and she coaxed it into music. Razza explained that when she improvised what she actually did was spin a melody around the current radio signals the planet received from the pulsar\u2013thus, her music was an amplification of stimuli to which the planet was already responding. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t work if she played written music. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t work if they played an old recording of previously improvised music. Razza, in zir articles, highlighted the role of serendipity in these discoveries: had Wren not had experimental surgery, and had she not happened upon Chau\u2019s lab when she did, none of this would ever have been known. Razza and Wren\u2019s research made quite a splash in the scientific community. As no useful practical application could be derived from this research, it made no splash anywhere else.\nAfter three years, the research consortia determined that further study of Polyphemus was not needed: minimal gains for the cost of upkeep on the stations. The scientists packed up their labs. They began to look for new places to study, new riddles to unravel. The news hit Wren like a slap to the face. She went numb for days. In the flurry of packing up, no one noticed when she left. She took a car and programmed it to drive her to the Cradle. She camped there for three aftershifts straight and spent her waking hours luring the land to dance before Razza found her. Ze rushed into the pristine valley and swept Wren into a tight hug. Wren\u2019s flute fell to the springy grass. \u201cGod, Wren, are you all right?\u201d Razza asked.\nWren accepted the hug but did not return it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re ok? You just disappeared! Why did you disable the car\u2019s GPS? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cAre they really going to make me leave?\u201d Wren asked.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Razza softly. \u201cOh, Batty, I didn\u2019t even think about how hard this must be for you.\u201d\nWren burst into tears, wretched pent-up tears that sliced through her and left her ragged in their wake. She fell into Razza\u2019s arms, and Razza guided them both to the valley floor. Razza rocked her and let her weep and stroked her hair. Slowly, the sobs subsided. She stayed where she was, curled in Razza\u2019s arms. \u201cI fit here. It\u2019s the only place I fit. I feel what the planet feels. I can give it something it can\u2019t get on its own. I\u2019m the only one the dark doesn\u2019t bother. Why do I have to go?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Batty, it\u2019s all just coincidence,\u201d said Razza very softly. \u201cThe pulsar, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s just a fluke of nature.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a fluke of nature. It means something to me! I know it\u2019s all just math to you, but it\u2019s music to me. Understand? Music\u2019s what happens when the math turns into something beautiful and real and worthwhile. Polyphemus isn\u2019t a research site to me, Razza. It\u2019s home. I\u2019m not a visitor here; I\u2019m indigene. Isn\u2019t there some way I can stay here? No one else has to stay. But can\u2019t I stay?\u201d\nRazza held her a little tighter. Ze was silent a long time. \u201cOh, Batty,\u201d ze said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I am. We have to go, and you have to go with us. I\u2019m sorry. But you know PSR L347-1153 isn\u2019t the only pulsar in the universe. How about we go back to Station Three , and you and I look for a post near another pulsar? Maybe it\u2019s time you gave a different star a chance to sing through you.\u201d\nWren pulled back and wiped her face. It wasn\u2019t time. She felt so rooted there on Polyphemus. It wouldn\u2019t be the same. But it would be something. \u201cYou would do that, Razza?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team, Batty. Of course I would. Can you do me a favor?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cCan you make the Cradle dance for me one last time?\u201d\nWren smiled. She found her flute in the grass, and she let the PSR L347-1153 sing through her. And all around her the land swayed and danced in what she could only understand was unfettered joy.\nB R Sanders is a white, genderqueer writer who lives and works in Denver, CO, with their family and two cats.

Prevost\nPiscrandiol Deigadis clutched the battered suitcase close, jars rattling inside as the train whined and staggered to a halt. Piscrandiol waited, eyes shut tight, feet and elbows pressing in all around them as passengers rushed for the exit. Over the din of disembarking, the rain made itself insistently known on the steel roof of the car.\nThe rain had started sixteen miles back, well beyond the border that separated Piscrandiol\u2019s native Salphaneyin from Orpanthyre. It had begun as a mist and crested to a deluge, and it had cracked Piscrandiol\u2019s life wide open like a miracle. Piscrandiol pressed their palm against the cool glass, heart pounding. Every trickle of water on the other side ghosted a kiss across their skin.\nIt had not rained in Salphaneyin for so long.\nOrpanthyre was a city of rain, a city where no one went thirsty and anyone could find work. The storm battered against the tarred roof of the train station like a thousand shouted promises as Piscrandiol waited for the exodus to subside. Finally, Piscrandiol took a breath, adjusted their skirts, and stepped out onto the platform.\nThe street outside the station was a noisy jumble: handcarts and chickens and babies, sunken-eyed miners, families struggling not to lose sight of each other in the heaving human tide. Copper roofs covered the downtown sidewalks, patina battered by seasons of rain, which traced elegant green arcs against a backdrop of stone and wood. Piscrandiol let the flow of the crowd lead them away from the station.\nDespite the roofs, there was water everywhere: splashed up by carriage wheels and the jostling steps of strangers, pouring out of the rumbling and broken-open sky, rushing down cast iron eavestroughs and churning white in the grate-covered gutters by Piscrandiol\u2019s feet. It was an excess, an exuberance of water, enough to fill every well in Salphaneyin. It sloshed through Piscrandiol\u2019s sandals and weighed down the hem of their skirts like it had nowhere better to be.\nPiscrandiol braced themselves against a stone wall at a crossroads where the crowd thinned out, and forced down a breath, eyes closing for a fluttering moment of reprieve. In just a short while, they\u2019d reunite with their cousin Geluol, who\u2019d left for the city three years ago. There would be a meal, a roof, a bed. All Piscrandiol had to do was keep their feet moving towards Seven Ingot Three Homeshare, and then the ordeal of traveling would be over.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an umbrella you need, you\u2019ve certainly come to the right place.\u201d\nPiscrandiol\u2019s knuckles turned white on the handle of their bag. They turned to the source of the voice \u2013 tall and ruddy-tan, with elaborate clothes, standing beside a narrow cart hung with dozens of colourful umbrellas.\nThe stranger graced Piscrandiol with a businesslike smile. \u201cNew to the city?\u201d\nPiscrandiol nodded, years of Orpan language classes tumbling together and screeching to a halt in their mouth.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need one of these \u2013 get you started right. Salphaney, aren\u2019t you? Lots of you coming \u2019round these days.\u201d\nPiscrandiol nodded again. They could feel the blush seeping into their cheeks, volunteering all the information their words couldn\u2019t provide.\nThe umbrella-seller smirked. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got a nice blue one that matches yunna skirt. Fifteen lam.\u201d\nPiscrandiol\u2019s mind stumbled over the pronoun \u2013 first gender, if they remembered right, but was it Piscrandiol they saw that way, or themselves? Piscrandiol had encountered the concept of gender at school, of course, when they\u2019d studied the Orpan language with everyone else, but having it thrown at them in conversation shattered six semesters\u2019 worth of confidence.\nPiscrandiol shook their head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d they managed, handing over a few coins before the umbrella seller could say anything else. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d They grabbed the umbrella and hurried back into the crowd.\nThe homeshare turned out to be a broad, four-storey square of dark tarred wood that flanked an open central quadrangle, with a custodian\u2019s office at the front. Rainwater pooled on the floorboards around Piscrandiol\u2019s shuffling feet as they tried to take in the fact that they were being turned away.\n\u201cNot moun fault we\u2019re full up, child,\u201d the custodian was saying, round brown eyes watching Piscrandiol like a clock ticking down to the end of their patience. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of you, coming into Orpanthyre. Not even just you Salphaney people, either. There\u2019s fires in Mollend, flooding downland\u2026\u201d They shook their head, dark coils tumbling about their shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t want to turn yeym out, but there\u2019s no room here.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 but makes no sense,\u201d Piscrandiol said, trembling slightly. \u201cPlease, I \u2013 I need to see my cousin. Geluol Bibenia?\u201d\nThe custodian rapped sturdy fingers on the top of their desk. \u201cBibenia. Wait half a minute, Bibenia. Hiy\u2019s the one been called out of town, isn\u2019t hiy. Left a message. Wouldn\u2019t be for yey, would it?\u201d\nPiscrandiol sighed, letting their eyes close briefly. Out of town? \u201cProbably.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t read Tisalpha, but here. I presume this is for yeym then.\u201d\nThe custodian handed Piscrandiol a flat metal container, and they accepted the familiar weight in their hands with some relief. Popping the latches revealed a hastily-imprinted clay tablet, its workmanship unmistakeably Geluol\u2019s.\nBabyhead, work beckoned & when the work calls I go. Sorry I couldn\u2019t be here to welcome you good & proper. We\u2019ll catch up when I get back \u2013 mining gig\u2019s usually 2-3 mo. but then I\u2019ll buy you dinner promise. Bunch of dinners. Anyhow if you need anything ask Dolein, they\u2019re good people & saving keys to apt. five-four for you. Stay tough. \u2013 Dumdum\nPiscrandiol couldn\u2019t help but smile at the childhood nicknames, but the idea of spending two or three months in the city without anyone they knew made the room spin. They closed the case and looked at the custodian. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cThe message? Oh, week ago, maybe. Was it for yeym?\u201d\nPiscrandiol nodded, placing their hands on the desk to steady themselves. \u201cWho is Dolein?\u201d\nThe custodian\u2019s patience cracked, a humourless smile carving dimples into their smooth cheeks. \u201cMe.\u201d\nPiscrandiol put down the first month\u2019s rent, effectively handing over most of what remained of their savings, and walked into the quadrangle past a busy jumble of sheds and tarps that suggested a vegetable garden and chicken coop. They dragged their suitcase up four steep flights of indoor stairs, legs trembling and aching, and turned the key in the latch of apartment five-four.\nPiscrandiol let the weight of their suitcase pull them through the door. The empty rooms echoed the drumbeat of rainfall on the roof immediately above, a hollow sound that trickled into every corner of the space. Piscrandiol wandered to the window and cracked it open, letting the downpour rage against their outstretched hand. They put it to their lips and drank; they splashed rainwater on their face. This was real. This was home.\nWell, not quite yet. Piscrandiol carefully opened their suitcase. With all the jostling, they\u2019d feared the worst \u2013 but the only casualty of the trip was one aloe leaf, snapped off and oozing. The jars themselves were all intact.\nRelieved, Piscrandiol unfolded the trellis against a wall, hanging the hoops straight. The heavier jars went on the bottom, of course \u2013 cloudy glass packed with earth and life-giving moisture. Piscrandiol spoke gently over each of the succulents, fingertips soothing leaves and stems, tiny petals, squat bulbs. In the topmost jars, thin, fleshy tendrils of dark blue spread out, banded with luminescent rings that cast a soft fairy-light against the wall \u2013 glowweed, Piscrandiol\u2019s favourite. Now this was home. Whatever came next, just like the plants, Piscrandiol would lay down roots and thrive.\nThe tendrils\u2019 gentle glow wouldn\u2019t light the whole apartment, though, and a search through closets and corners came up empty of candles. Piscrandiol steeled themselves in the bathroom mirror before trudging back down the stairs to face Dolein.\nThe custodian\u2019s office was unexpectedly busy. Two road-weary travelers were in heated conversation with Dolein, while a third tended to a small child; a second, older child crouched off to the side, playing with a bit of wire.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m telling youm we wrote ahead,\u201d the tall knife-faced one said, black hair clinging damply to their collar. \u201cWeeks ago.\u201d\nDolein pursed their lips. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling yiym we don\u2019t have record of it.\u201d\nThe traveler\u2019s barrel-chested companion tugged at their downy beard thoughtfully. \u201cGislen, if the letter got lost, there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell there isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not letting min family rot in the damn rain.\u201d\nThe third adult hoisted up the toddler, offering Piscrandiol a timidly apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, were yey wanting to speak with the building manager?\u201d They eased one long, ink-dark braid away from the child\u2019s grabbing hands. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a situation, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nPiscrandiol shook their head. \u201cI have arrived here today,\u201d they said, as if that would explain anything. Classroom sentences snapped apart and melded with others. \u201cI wish to get a candle. For upstairs?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I think we have some,\u201d they said, setting the toddler back down. \u201cOutside, though, in the cart. Appi, go play with Tafis, okay?\u201d\nThe toddler hid their face behind the adult\u2019s knee, clinging to the trouser fabric with needy hands. Piscrandiol smiled, lightly, and shook their head. \u201cI can wait.\u201d\nThe tall one, Gislen, walked over to lay a hand on the braided adult\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll work this out, Annat,\u201d they said, voice gentle. Their black eyes took in Piscrandiol. \u201cHello,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\u201cHey lives in the building,\u201d Gislen\u2019s friend said, before Piscrandiol had a chance to embarrass themselves. \u201cHey\u2019re looking for a candle.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we have those,\u201d Gislen remarked.\nPiscrandiol blushed. \u201cI can buy,\u201d they insisted.\n\u201cNah, we\u2019ve got this.\u201d Gislen\u2019s smile made them blush more. \u201cRefe and Annat can handle the housing muddle; I need some air anyway. Come on.\u201d\nThe tarp was fastened securely to the pull-cart, but Gislen seemed to know the exact location of everything underneath, because it took them mere moments to yank out a fat yellow candle and hand it to Piscrandiol. Piscrandiol thanked them earnestly.\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Gislen rocked on their heels, glancing over at the water spout gushing nearby. \u201cYou\u2019re from Salphaneyin, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou can tell?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you speak,\u201d Gislen said, offering Piscrandiol a quick smile. \u201cNothing wrong with it to mim. Hear you\u2019re having quite the drought, right? We\u2019re from downcountry, opposite kind of problem. Fields are washed out. Family decided to give it a go in the city.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty years,\u201d Piscrandiol said. \u201cI think. The last time it rained, I was baby.\u201d\nGislen frowned, nodding sympathetically. \u201cRough. Well.\u201d They barked a laugh. \u201cGot all the rain you could possibly want here, I guess.\u201d\nThe one with the beard burst through the door. \u201cListen, shou\u2019s being a goddamn hardass\u2014 oh hello,\u201d they said, noticing Piscrandiol. \u201cRefe Eibas Suu.\u201d They shot out a broad hand to shake. \u201cGislen bothering you?\u201d\nPiscrandiol giggled, shaking Refe\u2019s hand. \u201cMy name is Piscrandiol Deigadis, how do you do. Gislen is very nice.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Refe grinned pointedly at their companion. \u201cAnyway, not that I wish to interrupt, but\u2014 Gis, yi\u2019ve got to try talking to this person. Shou says they\u2019re full up, offers such kind sympathy for the children, of course, but says there\u2019s rules, Gis, including not renting out an apartment contracted to someone else. If yi\u2019ve ever heard of such a thing.\u201d\nGislen chuckled, shaking their head. \u201cLove, I\u2019ve spoken all I can to that one. Unless Annat has some tricks up shun sleeve, I think we\u2019re at an impasse here.\u201d\nSomething compelled the words out of Piscrandiol\u2019s throat. \u201cI\u2014\u201d Both travelers turned to look at them, and they continued, face burning. \u201cI, ah, you can stay with me. Tonight. Your family. I have big space, a-and small things.\u201d\nGislen pushed the hair out of their blinking eyes. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that. Put youm out like that.\u201d\nPiscrandiol shrugged. \u201cThe weather is very bad.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d Gislen admitted. \u201cI mean\u2026 if Annat can\u2019t work something out with the building manager\u2026 You\u2019d really do that?\u201d\nPiscrandiol shrugged again, smiling.\nThe custodian wouldn\u2019t commit to the safety of leaving a pull-cart in the quadrangle, so Gislen and the other four members of the Eibas family, with Piscrandiol\u2019s help, lugged everything up to apartment five-four. Appi, the toddler, ran to the plants immediately; only Refe\u2019s reflexes saved the trellis from disaster, scooping Appi into their arms, where they squirmed and reached towards the droopy glowweed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty plant, isn\u2019t it, Appi,\u201d Refe said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt it, right? So don\u2019t touch.\u201d They turned to Piscrandiol. \u201cNothing in there that would hurt a child overcome by curiosity, is there?\u201d\nPiscrandiol shook their head. \u201cMaybe, if\u2026 if Appi decides to fill the belly with rocks and dirt\u2026 it could be problem, but the plants? They will not make sick.\u201d\n\u201cThey really are beautiful.\u201d Refe grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured you invited us into your home tonight, Piscrandiol. We\u2019ll pay, of course.\u201d\nPiscrandiol shook their head. \u201cNo, no,\u201d they said. \u201cYou\u2026 your childs \u2013 children, they should not be in the rain.\u201d They blushed. \u201cAh, you also should not be in the rain, but\u2026\u201d\nRefe laughed, a warm sound that shook their stomach. \u201cI understand. Don\u2019t worry about it. We really are thankful.\u201d\n\u201cLet us provide supper, at the very least,\u201d said Annat, carefully putting a metal-cornered crate down on the floor before taking Appi from Refe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe have enough to share.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Piscrandiol answered, smiling. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe meal was sausages fried on an elaborate stove that Piscrandiol would not have known how to light, along with apples, dry bread, and cheese. Piscrandiol brewed a hot, sweet tea from a bundle of dried herbs, which garnered compliments even from the children. That evening, the Eibas family laid out their mats in the main room and slept in a pile, Tafis and Appi tucked among their three parents. Piscrandiol smiled at the scene of familial comfort, but declined the generous invitation to partake, explaining that they preferred their own mat. They wished the Eibas clan good night and retired to the nearby bedroom.\nPiscrandiol laid a thin wool blanket on the floorboards and stretched out on it, listening to the rain. They felt guilty for lying about having a mat, but the companionship in the living room wasn\u2019t theirs to enjoy. It should have all been different. It should have been Geluol offering candles and dinner and friendship, not the warm pile of strangers snoring outside of Piscrandiol\u2019s door. Geluol, their only family in Orpanthyre; Geluol, who would be gone for months.\nPiscrandiol rested their palms against damp eyes, shoulder blades digging into the floor. No one here even spoke Tisalpha; no one knew the same stories or laughed at the same jokes or loved the same food. But going back to the drought and hunger of Salphaneyin\u2026 No. Their parents were counting on them to send money home. Their parents were counting on them to thrive.\nThe grey light of dawn teased Piscrandiol\u2019s eyes open from an almost-sleep of fears and memories. They rolled onto their back and let out a soft breath.\nPiscrandiol stretched their aching bones by the tall narrow window, watching the world turn slowly golden in the sun. At some point, during the night, the hammering rain had stopped; Piscrandiol rested their forehead on the glass, and watched layer after layer of Orpan architecture reveal itself as the day burned away the lingering mist. It was a beautiful city, really, this foreign place, when there were no people to ruin the view: verdigris domes and wrought iron swirls, tarred wood, green glass, smoke drifting from the factories downwind. A city built for rainy days.\nPiscrandiol sighed and headed into the small bathroom, taking a quick wash before changing into clean clothes. They shaved carefully in the plate-sized mirror, taking time not to miss any patches in the corners of their jaw, and brushed the tangles out of their waist-long hair.\n\u201cScrandle?\u201d\nPiscrandiol smiled, looking down to the source of the brave attempt at pronouncing their name. \u201cWhat is it, Appi?\u201d\n\u201cNanat says, Na, Nanat says breakfast is ready.\u201d The toddler hopped from one foot to the next. \u201cI need to poop.\u201d\nPiscrandiol laughed and let the child take over the bathroom, heading out into the living room where Refe was stirring a thick white porridge on the stove. Their sleeves were pushed up, their hairy arms tattooed in bright blues and pinks and greens.\n\u201cJust in time,\u201d they said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a sunny day in Orpanthyre. The rarest of miracles.\u201d\nPiscrandiol glanced out the window. \u201cThis is sunny?\u201d\nRefe laughed loudly. \u201cI like yunna sense of humour!\u201d\nPiscrandiol smiled shyly and busied themselves with making tea. It had been so easy, for a time, to completely forget about the Orpan concept of gender. Of course avoiding pronouns forever would have been too much to hope for.\nStudying Orpan at school, they had run up against its dizzying array of pronouns \u2013 three genders with three grammatical cases, a system that at least made up in consistency for what it lacked in common sense. Memorizing the words had been work, but not nearly as hard as understanding when to use them. The teacher had tried to explain the concept of gender: a way the Orpan people spoke and presented themselves differently, based on some sort of internal social sense of being. In class, some had gossiped behind chalk-dusted fingers that gender was about what Orpan people had between their legs, but the teacher had overheard and categorically denied it; whatever it was, as far as Piscrandiol was concerned, it was as inscrutable as how bats flew in the dark.\nWatching the Eibas family communicate over breakfast, though, with their effortless and ever-shifting palette of pronouns, made Piscrandiol feel clumsy and wrong. For one thing, it didn\u2019t even seem like the words people used always stayed the same. Annat said heym to refer to Refe, while Gislen said hem. Where Gislen called Annat shum, Refe said shumma. Whatever gender the Eibas clan saw themselves as having, it changed depending on who they were talking to, leaving Piscrandiol scrambling after clues in the context. It all seemed needlessly complicated for something that, as far as Piscrandiol could tell, didn\u2019t mean anything at all.\nAfter breakfast, Refe helped Piscrandiol with tidying up, drying each plate as best they could. \u201cI hate to ask, but the little ones were on their feet all day yesterday, and\u2026 Well, is it all right if I stay here with the children while Annat and Gislen go look for somewhere else to stay?\u201d They frowned, a crease puckering their brow. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to add to the burden we\u2019ve already placed on you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Piscrandiol shook their head quickly. \u201cNo burden. Please stay.\u201d The thought of suddenly being alone in a bare apartment with only the plants for company opened a yawning pit of dread in Piscrandiol\u2019s stomach. It wouldn\u2019t even be so bad, really, if the Eibas clan stayed a little longer.\nRefe was charming and warm, and gestured expansively when they told stories, which happened a lot. The children made a game of exploring the apartment, which allowed Refe and Piscrandiol a quarter hour of storytelling before the toddler was back at the trellis of succulents.\nPiscrandiol stood up quickly, but Appi\u2019s sibling was already carefully pulling the little one away from the fragile plants. Piscrandiol gave them an appreciative smile.\n\u201cUm, Piscrandiol?\u201d Tafis said, squinting at the jars. \u201cWhy\u2019d you carry all this stuff with you from Salphaneyin? Gis said you didn\u2019t even bring candles.\u201d\nPiscrandiol looked down, chuckling a little. \u201cWell, ah, hmm. For us, every plant has meaning, has useful. All from my family home in Salphaneyin, but at home,\u201d Piscrandiol said, gesturing broadly, \u201cthe whole wall. We can stay cool, and \u2013 look,\u201d they said, pointing to the dip between two fleshy leaves, where moisture was collecting. \u201cWe can\u2026 ah\u2026 A system, it takes water from all leaves and puts together for drink.\u201d\nRefe walked over. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just collect rainwater?\u201d Tafis asked, frowning in a sharp way that suddenly brought out the resemblance to Gislen.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t rain in Salphaneyin, Tafis,\u201d Refe explained.\n\u201cLike, at all?\u201d\nRefe shook their head. \u201cRight, Piscrandiol?\u201d\nPiscrandiol nodded sadly. \u201cTwenty years, almost, no rain.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Tafis gawked, looking towards the window. \u201cThat must be amazing.\u201d\nRefe laughed and rubbed the child\u2019s feathery black hair. \u201cYou need rain to make food grow, Taf. And to drink, and clean things, and all that. \u2013Appi, what\u2019s that in yenna hand?\u201d\nThe toddler quickly hid something behind their back, but not before Piscrandiol recognized it.\n\u201cIt is broken leaf,\u201d Piscrandiol said quickly. \u201cI put on window side yesterday. Not dangerous. Good for sunburn.\u201d\nRefe crouched down in front of the toddler. \u201cGive it to me, honey.\u201d\nAppi scowled and shook their head.\n\u201cI just want to see it, okay? Come on. I\u2019ll give it back.\u201d\nThe child hesitated, then grudgingly handed their parent the snapped-off succulent. Refe stood, sighing. \u201cDefinitely chewed on.\u201d\n\u201cNot dangerous,\u201d Piscrandiol repeated, reassuringly. \u201cAlso\u2026\u201d They indicated a low, moss-like plant with tiny yellow bulbs. \u201cThis one, for when you have stomach hurt. Very good, even when small child eats things.\u201d\n\u201cBut this stuff looks really heavy,\u201d Tafis said, prodding one of the jars. \u201cAnnat said we couldn\u2019t bring anything heavy. I had to leave all min best toys.\u201d\nPiscrandiol\u2019s fingertips traced the ridged edge of a leaf. \u201cHeavy, yes,\u201d they mused, wondering how in the world they could express in Orpan what the trellis meant to a Salphaney family. \u201cHeavy but\u2026 this one,\u201d they said, reverently lifting a small jar with sharp, red-tipped leaves, \u201cit is cut from\u2026 very old plant. Many generations. And this one, I found in desert. I was about same old as you.\u201d They indicated a bubbly little spray of light green. \u201cAll here, these are from kitchen of house when I was a child, and \u2013 ah! This one,\u201d Piscrandiol quirked a smile, showing a coral-blooming cactus, \u201cis ah, how do you say, farewell? Farewell from my first sweetheart.\u201d They grinned. \u201cDo you see?\u201d\nRefe hoisted Appi into their arms. \u201cYeah,\u201d they said, smiling softly. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d said Tafis.\n\u201cSome things,\u201d Refe said, \u201cyou carry around with you no matter what, because\u2026 Well, maybe they\u2019re heavy, but they lift you up, too, right?\u201d\nTafis tugged on Refe\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nPiscrandiol turned to the window, smiling, blinking back tears.\nMaybe it was the influx of refugees fleeing the devastation of the floods, or Salphaney filling train car after train car, but when Gislen and Annat returned that night, they proclaimed there was not a single available apartment in the city. Piscrandiol grinned from where they sat on the floor, hair twisted into loops by Appi and Tafis, and made the offer they had been thinking about all day.\nIt was surprisingly easy to agree on the division of rent and chores, easy to accompany Annat to the market to invest in sleeping mats and lanterns, cups and rice and soap, the many necessities of family life. Piscrandiol spared a little for clothing, as well: no one in Orpanthyre wore skirts, since there was always a gutter or a drain for them to get sodden in, so they brought a pair of simple tan trousers, and boots that sealed the water out. Annat taught Piscrandiol how to pull their copper-brown hair into two long braids, flat and skinny down their back; it took hours to get it right, leaving Piscrandiol perplexed by the apparent ease of Annat\u2019s deft brown fingers to do the same, but in the end the braids received the Appi tug of approval. Annat laughed with delight.\nAnnat was also the first to find employment, carding cotton at one of the city\u2019s sprawling mills. Things were looking hopeful for Piscrandiol, as well: they were on the mill\u2019s waiting list, and would be contacted as soon as a position opened up. Refe, who spent most days out in the city seeking work, told Piscrandiol that if they\u2019d made the list it was best not to continue applying elsewhere, so they ended up shouldering most of the home and childcare duties with Gislen, at least until the family could afford to send Tafis and Appi to school. This suited Piscrandiol just fine.\nOne morning over a cup of tea, as the children practiced their letters in chalk on the floor by the window, Piscrandiol asked Gislen about Refe\u2019s work.\n\u201cHeh\u2019s a professor, by training,\u201d Gislen said, shifting comfortably on the floor cushion. \u201cHistory. There must be a hundred unemployed professors of history in Orpanthyre, of course, but heh\u2019s dead set on finding work in hen field.\u201d\nPiscrandiol looked up from the dewflowers the two of them had started sketching with a bit of the children\u2019s chalk. \u201cIt is not good?\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2026 Sure, I\u2019d also love to work in my field, but instead, I\u2019m answering every \u2018help wanted\u2019 sign I see. I don\u2019t blame Refe, really I don\u2019t,\u201d they said, running a hand across their forehead with a sigh. \u201cHeh\u2019s good at hen job. But we can\u2019t feed five people \u2013 six,\u201d they smirked warmly at Piscrandiol, who blushed, \u201con one person\u2019s salary. We\u2019ll barely make next month\u2019s rent, in this\u2026 What.\u201d They narrowed their eyes. Piscrandiol was laughing.\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Piscrandiol shifted a bit closer, reaching out to brush the smudge of chalk from Gislen\u2019s brow. \u201cThis.\u201d They raised a chalky fingertip before dotting it playfully on the tip of Gislen\u2019s sharp nose.\nGislen laughed and grabbed Piscrandiol\u2019s hand, and Piscrandiol\u2019s heart rioted in their chest.\nGislen\u2019s eyes were black and bright like galaxies, long straight lashes casting flickering shadows over flushed clay-dark cheeks. Gislen\u2019s fingers laced with Piscrandiol\u2019s tightly, and Gislen\u2019s lips\u2026 They were soft, hungry, and hot and bitter like tea, and Piscrandiol never wanted the kiss to end.\nAppi shrieked something at their sibling, and Gislen and Piscrandiol parted, far too soon. Piscrandiol\u2019s heartbeat throbbed against their interlaced fingers. Piscrandiol could barely dare presume \u2013 barely had the words to ask \u2013 if this was all right, but in the way Gislen held their hand, in Gislen\u2019s irrepressible smile, Piscrandiol seemed to understand that the Eibas family would approve. They rested a flushed cheek on Gislen\u2019s shoulder and watched the children play.\nIt wasn\u2019t much later that Gislen found work at a butcher shop, and Piscrandiol was left to look after Tafis and Appi alone. Gislen came home every night tired and smelling of blood; Piscrandiol heated water for their bath and regaled them with tales of their day. And when the children slept, there was time enough for the two of them.\n\u201cI hate waiting list,\u201d Piscrandiol sighed, limbs tangled with Gislen\u2019s, blankets kicked to the edge of the mat. \u201cAnnat doesn\u2019t even need to say anymore. Just comes home and looks sad.\u201d\n\u201cSomething will open up,\u201d Gislen said, kissing Piscrandiol\u2019s temple. \u201cRefe seems to think so.\u201d\nPiscrandiol made a quiet noise. \u201cRefe is a good friend. Sometimes, ah, many times, I worry about jealous\u2026 About us\u2026 \u201c\nGislen smiled. \u201cVery considerate, but you don\u2019t need to worry. Refe thinks you\u2019re great. You know that, Pisc.\u201d\nPiscrandiol tucked their head under Gislen\u2019s chin. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2026 I\u2019m attracted,\u201d they admitted.\n\u201cTo\u2026 Refe?\u201d\nPiscrandiol nodded, but looked up sharply when Gislen laughed.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s hardly what I meant. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re expected to \u2013 to be attracted to all of us. Refe never thinks about that stuff, anyway. I mean, it happens sometimes.\u201d They grinned. \u201cOr else we wouldn\u2019t have Taf and Appi, but\u2026\u201d\nPiscrandiol smiled, looking down awkwardly. \u201cOh, ah, about that, I won\u2019t\u2026 I mean\u2026 When we\u2026\u201d\nGislen nuzzled Piscrandiol\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me pregnant, no. I\u2019m being careful.\u201d They stretched happily. \u201cHowever, I do know that Annat\u2019s been thinking about having another baby, so if you\u2019re interested\u2026\u201d\nPiscrandiol sputtered, and Gislen laughed, muffling it with a pillow. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Shou has been stealing glances at you, though,\u201d they said, thin lips drawn into a smirk. \u201cShou thinks you\u2019re adorable but is much too kind to express jealousy.\u201d\nPiscrandiol tucked their blushing cheek against their lover\u2019s arm. \u201cWell, ah, shou can, ah, talk to me about it, at some time. I would be happy to know shou better.\u201d\nGislen laughed, twining their fingers together. The sound filled up Piscrandiol\u2019s heart with light like a balloon.\n\u201cAll right. That\u2019s fine by mim. But\u2026 it\u2019s not shou; for you, it\u2019s shum.\u201d\nPiscrandiol squinted, still flushed. \u201cI \u2026Sorry?\u201d\n\u201cShou likes youm, you should talk to shum,\u201d Gislen said. \u201cIs it okay if I explain?\u201d\nPiscrandiol sighed. \u201cYou \u2026 Orpan has much too many pronouns.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that many! Anyway, I haven\u2019t wanted to correct you, but you should probably say yiy to me instead of you, actually.\u201d\nPiscrandiol grabbed the pillow and smacked Gislen with it. \u201cIt is difficult!\u201d They complained. \u201cWe have four pronouns; Orpan has forty-five.\u201d\nGislen wrestled the pillow from their grasp, grinning. \u201cFairly certain you have more than four.\u201d\nPiscrandiol counted irritably on their fingers. \u201cOkay, well, then nine. It is still not forty-five, Gislen.\u201d\nGislen smiled, tossing the pillow aside. \u201cI love the way you say min name,\u201d they said, and pulled Piscrandiol into a kiss that made them forget about words entirely. It was unreal, finding such brightness in the grey of Orpanthyre\u2019s endless storms. Under Gislen\u2019s tenderness, their hunger, Piscrandiol unraveled like an abandoned skein.\nJust when it seemed the rain would go on forever, the season fizzled into something hotter and hazier. The air hung yellow in the evenings; the streets were loud with the buzzing of insects, and blossoms in a riot of colours burst out on the trees. And one heavy, humid day, Refe came home jubilant, arms full of sweets and flowers.\nIt was a part-time position, Refe was quick to qualify, a teaching assistantship for a single course that was hardly their specialty, but the faculty at Five Rosewater College had seemed happy to take them on, and they would start next week. It was a trek, on the far side of town, but with the additional income they\u2019d finally be able to send the kids to school. Tafis ran around the apartment in glee, and their little sibling followed suit without really knowing why, hands full of candy.\nThe following week, Piscrandiol walked Tafis and Appi to Ingot City School, and found themselves alone in Orpanthyre for the first time in nearly two months. As they wandered towards the vegetable market, it was hard to ignore that they were the only adult left without a job; the only member of the household, even, without a place to be. Back at the homeshare, Piscrandiol chopped parsnips and chard and hot green peppers for stew. Two months on the waiting list at the cotton mill. Two months. It was impossible nothing had opened up. Unless there wasn\u2019t one at all; maybe \u201cwaiting list\u201d was just a way to let Salphaney off easy without actually giving them employment.\nPiscrandiol slammed the knife into the cutting board.\nGeluol hadn\u2019t trained as a miner. Their cousin was a poet, a painter, who had woven worlds of beauty onto the best pottery from the family kiln. But Orpanthyre had robbed them of that gift. Orpanthyre had thrown them in a pit full of sweaty, aching bodies and demanded coal. And Geluol was one of the lucky ones; lines stretched along the sidewalk at the day-labour agencies, Salphaney skirts and sandals and unbraided hair, and very few Orpans between them.\nPiscrandiol would never get off that waiting list.\nThey took a deep breath. How could they explain this to Annat, whose eyes held a steadfast shimmer of hope, whose little heart beat so fast in the darkness? How would the Eibas family react, hearing that the city that had welcomed their kin had no mercy for the stranger? The hospitality of their people was tarnished, but rejecting it would paint Piscrandiol as ungrateful.\nPiscrandiol\u2019s stomach churned with dread. The Eibas clan had been so kind. They could never know.\nEvery day Piscrandiol visited the vegetable market, and every day they pushed through their awkwardness and asked the merchants if anyone they knew was looking for help. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised them that no one ever was. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised them that the \u2018help wanted\u2019 signs had all been taken down from the shop windows. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised them that by the time they made it to the day-labour lines after market, the jobs for the day were already taken, or that the factories weren\u2019t hiring. Every day, Piscrandiol went home filled with grey thoughts, and sought solace in a trellis full of plants that had adjusted far better to Orpanthyre than they had. And every evening, the Eibas clan came home full of stories, and Piscrandiol served them soup and let them talk. No one seemed to notice Piscrandiol\u2019s silence and secrets, and Gislen still shared Piscrandiol\u2019s sleeping mat, sometimes.\nIt was so easy to pretend that nothing between them had changed, so tempting. Piscrandiol should have known that Gislen saw through the silence. That they would wait for the middle of a quiet night to bring it up, catching Piscrandiol unwound and vulnerable.\n\u201cIs there anything we need to talk about, Pisc?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t even a reasonable secret to keep. It was taking up all this space between them and it was pointless \u2013 a tangle of shame and worthlessness, a weight of unbelonging. Why couldn\u2019t Piscrandiol just let it go?\n\u201cTalk to me,\u201d Gislen pleaded. Skinny fingers tangled in Piscrandiol\u2019s long hair.\n\u201cI talk every day,\u201d Piscrandiol snapped, pulling away. \u201cI\u2026 I talk every day at the market.\u201d It was like pruning away what they were too ashamed to share, working to shape a palatable fact. \u201cEvery day\u2026 every day I speak Orpan until I have no words anymore.\u201d The sculpted truth filled Piscrandiol\u2019s gut with bitterness.\nGislen sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish I spoke Tisalpha\u2026 Maybe you could try teaching the children.\u201d\nPiscrandiol closed their eyes. \u201cMaybe. I\u2019m so tired. Everything is shou this and yunna that, and every person knows well how to say it, but I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d A hand reached for Piscrandiol\u2019s shoulder.\nPiscrandiol shrugged off the touch and sat up. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They swept their hair off to the side, locks clinging together with cooling sweat. Nothing ever dried in Orpanthyre. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 how am I supposed to know.\u201d\nGislen sat up beside them. \u201cYour gender? You just do. You don\u2019t need to overthink it.\u201d\n\u201cYou \u2013 yiy just do,\u201d Piscrandiol retorted. \u201cAnnat just does. Refe just does. Maybe Appi even. I just don\u2019t.\u201d\nGislen sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do, Pisc. Listen \u2013 maybe I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2026 you\u2019re more like Annat than Refe or mim, right? It\u2019s not like you can not have a gender. Maybe, I don\u2019t know, youn culture and min culture present it differently. But\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOur culture doesn\u2019t present it at all, Gislen,\u201d Piscrandiol said, glaring at them. \u201cWhy is this so hard to understand? We don\u2019t think, \u2018Oh, I am this, that person is an other this\u2019. Some behave this way, some behave that way, but it is not gender.\u201d\n\u201cPisc, I find it seriously hard to believe that youn entire region doesn\u2019t have anyone with gender in it.\u201d Gislen rubbed at their forehead.\n\u201cWell, I \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what yiy think! I\u2019m sick of \u2013 of always being youn and shou and \u2013 I don\u2019t want it!\u201d\nGislen tried to take Piscrandiol\u2019s hands, but they pulled back.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Gislen\u2019s hands hung in the air. \u201cAll right. I can use different words, love, I can\u2026 Just tell me what you want.\u201d\nPiscrandiol ran a hand across their face. They were having an argument, now, and none of it was even the point\u2026 Except that it was. Just one more way in which Piscrandiol was an outsider. \u201cIt\u2026 Yiy\u2019re kind, yiy\u2019re so kind, Gislen,\u201d Piscrandiol murmured, voice dull with exhaustion. \u201cBut\u2026 It is everywhere. Everywhere I go, I \u2013 I can\u2019t get away, everyone looks and assumes, one thing, another thing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t change society, Pisc.\u201d Gislen clutched at the blanket. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t feel it, you\u2026 What can I say? You give people a certain impression. It\u2019s just how we work.\u201d\nPiscrandiol stood and left, naked feet scuffing across the floor to the living room.\n\u201cPisc\u2026?\u201d\nPiscrandiol didn\u2019t listen. Ignoring the sleeping family, they stood on tip-toes to grab the pruning shears from the top of the trellis before returning. Gislen gasped and took a step back, but Piscrandiol ignored them too, heading for the bathroom.\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Please, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\nPiscrandiol looked straight in the mirror as they lifted the shears. Two feet of stringy red-brown hair fell to the floor like dead leaves, like shed skin. They heard Gislen gasp and stifle a cry, but did not stop until their head felt weightless, untethered. Then they put the shears down on the sink, and looked up.\nGislen was weeping.\nPiscrandiol shivered, their shoulder blades catching the chill of the night air. \u201cAll it said was lies,\u201d they said, feeling like they should cry as well, but finding tears too distant to answer the call. \u201cAll these pronouns are lies. So now? Am I different pronouns now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Gislen took a careful step closer, then another, finally pulling Piscrandiol into their arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I love youm. Yem. None of it, all of it, forget it. Forgive mim. I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll figure this out. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nPiscrandiol stood in the resolute affection of Gislen\u2019s embrace, until, with time, they stopped shaking.\nThe children spent the morning grabbing handfuls of Piscrandiol\u2019s new short hair, getting it to stick up in ways that made them topple over laughing. Piscrandiol knew they should find some way to speak with the adults about what happened, address the rift that was slowly taking form. But the silence stretched out through a day and a night of missed opportunities, and then Tafis came home from school with tiny sprouting peas and asked Piscrandiol for help planting them, and Piscrandiol found it far too easy to focus on that instead.\nThe quadrangle was crowded with summer-rich gardens, and among them, waterlogged and flecked with moss, Piscrandiol found the patch of soil dedicated to apartment five-four. They spent a morning on their knees in the mud, Tafis eager to help, until the sprouts were nestled in grooves in the fresh-turned earth. Piscrandiol showed the child how to hammer together a frame to help the pea shoots grow tall, and the two of them went out every day to watch the tender green vines reach for the sky, until they grew strong and thick with sweet-smelling flowers.\nThe garden was a revelation. Little by little, through the days of planting and weeding, Piscrandiol found their spirit returning. Appi surprised them with a shriveled piece of taro that had sprouted long hungry tendrils \u2013 a cherished toy, which they\u2019d been hiding somewhere. Piscrandiol and Appi planted it together, reverentially, and it soon spread broad, heart-shaped leaves that thirsted for the sun. Piscrandiol bought seeds from the market to keep it company, traded with neighbours, and even brought down a fat little blockleaf succulent from the trellis upstairs. Soon the garden was flourishing with watercress and climbing spinach, and Tafis\u2019 vines had sprouted pods of fat peas that the children scarfed down by the handful. In time everything grew, even hair.\nOr, almost. One morning Piscrandiol found the blockleaf sagged and wilted, drowning in the sodden earth. Piscrandiol kneeled at the edge of the plot and dug their trowel into the soil, carefully lifting the plant up. Rot was spreading in its shallow roots; but maybe if they kept it in a pot, with holes in the bottom\u2026\n\u201cCousin!\u201d\nIt took Piscrandiol a moment before they realized that the deep voice had spoken in Tisalpha. They turned just in time to be swept up in familiar sinewy arms and spun around as if the mud on their knees and the plant clutched in their hand didn\u2019t matter. They stared up into a grinning umber face.\nGeluol was back.\nPiscrandiol\u2019s cousin hit it off immediately with the Eibas clan, talking easily about everything and nothing, and also talking about Piscrandiol, which made them want to disappear. Annat insisted they have a special supper, and Refe ran out to get a whole goose already roasted while Annat and Gislen fried vegetables and Tafis tended the rice. Piscrandiol threw together a salad of garden greens and stumbled through their cousin\u2019s giddy questions. Had they gotten the tablet; had Dolein helped them out? How had they met the Eibas family and ended up living with them? Did they have a job? Were they seeing anyone? Piscrandiol tumbled through replies in a mother tongue that felt clumsy until it didn\u2019t, and suddenly they had their own voice again.\nAnd Geluol\u2026 Geluol was perfect at Orpan, too, navigating pronouns like all of it was a breeze, like they\u2019d always known how, like gender was the simplest thing in the world. Watching them all chat over tea in the lamplight, with Appi falling asleep in their lap, Piscrandiol wondered when Geluol had become more of a stranger than the rest of them. Piscrandiol stroked Appi\u2019s ink-black curls and stared into the lamp\u2019s flickering flame.\nThe next morning, before they could change their mind, Piscrandiol pulled Gislen aside. \u201cI\u2019ve been lying to you.\u201d\nGislen frowned and cast a glance over their shoulder where Annat was dressing the children. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nPisc tucked their hair behind their ears. \u201cFor a few weeks. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nGislen glanced away again, then took Piscrandiol\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201d\nPisc nodded. Their hand felt cold and clammy inside Gislen\u2019s all the way down the stairs.\nThey stood on the covered walkway outside their door, sheltered from the light rain.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Pisc?\u201d\nPiscrandiol watched the rain trickle down the taro leaves. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for work.\u201d\nGislen turned and looked at them. \u201cYeah?\u201d\nPiscrandiol nodded. Thunder rumbled, but distant.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Gislen said, encouraging. \u201cDid\u2026 did something happen? Did you find something?\u201d\nPiscrandiol bit their lip and shook their head.\nGislen took a deep breath. \u201cSo\u2026 what, uh, what have you been lying about?\u201d\nPiscrandiol glanced over. \u201cAnnat\u2026 Annat believes the waiting list, and Refe said, I mean, Refe said I shouldn\u2019t look, and\u2026 I don\u2019t think the waiting list is real, or, not real for me, and\u2026\u201d They took Gislen\u2019s hands, looking up into their gaze. \u201cYou all work so hard. But no job wants Piscrandiol. So many Salphaney looking for work. So I\u2026 I make soup, and I grow vegetables, and every day I look for work, but there is no work. And my parents, I need to send money, and you, your family, I take advantage. You are so generous, but this city, I can\u2019t always\u2026\u201d\nGislen gently squeezed their hands. \u201cOh, love,\u201d they murmured, tugging until Piscrandiol was in their arms. \u201cOh, love.\u201d\nPisc closed their eyes, cheek on Gislen\u2019s shoulder. Gislen was quiet for a good long time, and Piscrandiol hung on, scared that when they let go, Gislen would say something terrible.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not taking advantage of anyone, Pisc,\u201d Gislen said, finally. \u201cI love yem. We all love yem. The children think you are the greatest thing they\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nPisc chuckled, in spite of themselves, and gave Gislen a squeeze.\n\u201cListen,\u201d Gislen continued, parting enough to be able to meet Piscrandiol\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry if we gave yem the impression you\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t be looking for work because Annat put yem on a waiting list. You can do whatever you want. And we\u2019re happy having you at home, if that\u2019s what you want. I didn\u2019t realize we were putting this pressure on yem. I know we didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\nPiscrandiol smiled weakly. \u201cYiy\u2019re mixing up pronouns,\u201d they pointed out. \u201cFirst and second.\u201d\nGislen blushed, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m trying something new. Adapting.\u201d\nPiscrandiol took Gislen\u2019s hand back, threading their fingers together. \u201cGeluol has no trouble with pronouns,\u201d they complained.\n\u201cSo what.\u201d Gislen kissed Piscrandiol\u2019s head. \u201cSome people behave one way, some people behave another way, and that doesn\u2019t mean anything, right? That\u2019s what you told me. I believe it.\u201d\nPiscrandiol leaned their temple against Gislen\u2019s shoulder and looked out at the garden. The peas were all but harvested, their vines growing tough, but the season was far from over. It would be time to plant something else soon.\nA.E.

Colder than I remembered.\nThe arches of Charles Bridge cut deep shadows into the roil and tumble of the Vltava River. Dwarfed by the crumbling facades of Lesser Town, I leaned against a lamppost, sucking long pulls from a Davidoff. It was a silly idea; I hadn\u2019t smoked in years, and every drag burned my lungs like the first time. But I\u2019d been smoking that night, three years ago. The night Freddie disappeared. So I figured I\u2019d do it all over again.\nLovers clung to one another as they stumbled across the bridge, puffing tandem bursts of steam into the night air. Laughing to stay warm, pausing to press chapped lips together. Freddie told me that night, her green eyes glowing in the candlelight of the basement bar, that Prague was the only city in the world more romantic in the winter. The promise of warmth piping from a hundred stoves. Pub windows fogged up from the whispers of a thousand finger-locked couples. Dvorak concertos drifting through narrow alleys lined with flickering gas lamps. \u201cMedieval romance,\u201d she said.\nAnd then she was gone.\nI ground the cigarette into the cobblestone, then took the stairs in threes up the bridge. By the time I reached the top, the nicotine had left me lightheaded. A patchy fog hung above the statues, lending credence to their judging stares. I turned my head away, anxious to avoid their verdict. It had taken me three years to come back; I was going to see this through to the end. I had to find out what happened to Freddie.\nEvery stone in the bridge was exactly how I remembered it, from the first time Freddie and I walked its length. Cassidy had just kicked me out\u2014for the second time, but not the last\u2014and I needed some distance. Something to clear my mind. Prague was cheap, and I didn\u2019t need a visa to disappear here for a few months. The first time I set eyes on Freddie, I was stumbling through a jet lag induced haze, not four hours after my plane touched down. She was measuring ant trails along the base of the Saint Wenceslas statue, hair frazzled like an orange hedgehog. She caught me staring, and before I had a chance to stammer out an apology, she thrust a protractor into my hands. \u201cFinally,\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d been waiting for me for hours. \u201cGet ready.\u201d So I did. Later that night, we drank absinthe with our legs dangling over the side of Charles Bridge, her face aglow in the city lights. What I didn\u2019t know yet, was that beneath the frazzled hair and freckled skin, Freddie was different.\nThe chip rested inside the base of her skull. The doctors called it a neural relief processor, but she just called it \u201cthe chip\u201d. It controlled a host of nanotech reconstructors that burrowed into her brain, repairing synapses and maintaining conductivity on the fly. Keeping her alive. The first time she explained it, I thought it was another one of her twisted jokes. I kept waiting for the punch line, but it never came.\nThe car crash had left both her parents dead, and Freddie tied to machines. Her dad had been a big-shot scientist in New York, and he\u2019d signed the whole family up for every experimental procedure under the sun, in the event of a life-threatening condition. The cerebral reconstruction process only had five successful patients to-date. Freddie made it six, thanks to the goodwill of an anonymous investor. Her coma broke within a month, and she walked out of the hospital three days later.\nBut the chip was still experimental. According to her brother, the operation changed her\u2014made her a different person. She joked that the chip had a mind of its own, that even though it was keeping her alive she still had to be careful, or it might take over one day. I thought she was joking at the time. \u201cCyber-woman,\u201d she said with somber eyes. Then her lips twisted into a smile and she grabbed my coat. Her breath was spicy like licorice. \u201cBut enough about me.\u201d\nI leaned over the edge of the cold stone railing. It couldn\u2019t be more than fifty feet to the water. People could survive that kind of fall. Couldn\u2019t they? All the cops found was her necklace, clinging to the riverbank downstream. It was the same necklace she wore every day that winter. Just a piece of junk from the thrift shop, she said. A stainless-steel circle with rods running through the center at odd angles, like a surrealist\u2019s impression of an astronomical clock. That was it. No body, no blood, no note. We were heading home late from Pod Kroka, and she said she needed to stop for something. \u201cWait for me,\u201d she said at the foot of the bridge, and then she was gone.\nI backed away from the railing. If I was going to find the truth, I\u2019d better start at the beginning. Like so many nights that winter, our last night together started at the absinthe bar. So that\u2019s where I headed.\nMost absinthe bars in Prague were tourist traps, and U V\u00edla was no exception. Uninspired nude art blanketed the walls. A holographic green fairy stood guard atop each table, beckoning hordes of English and American post-teens in from the cold. I never knew what Freddie saw in the place. But it was warm, and they knew us there. And Freddie liked it, so I never asked. Just like so many things.\nThat night we\u2019d gone early, so it was nearly deserted. This time was much the same. Incense and licorice invaded my nostrils. The corner table by the window was vacant, and I half-expected to hear Freddie\u2019s voice in my ear. \u201cHow about there?\u201d As if we\u2019d ever sat anywhere else.\nA maze of faded tattoos moved behind the bar. Ingrid was working at a persistent smudge on a glass, the rag whipping about in her hand.\n\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d I said.\nIngrid\u2019s crystal blue eyes widened. She leaned across the bar and wrapped me up in an awkward hug. She smelled of sweat and tobacco.\n\u201cJohnny.\u201d Her accent had gotten thicker. \u201cHow the hell?\u201d\n\u201cGood to see you, Ingrid.\u201d\nShe poured me a frothy Staropramen, then got back to polishing. \u201cHeard you got married.\u201d\n\u201cShe left me.\u201d I took a swig of beer, trying not to think about where Cassidy might be by now. Somewhere better than I\u2019d ever taken her, hopefully. \u201cSaid I couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201d\nIngrid\u2019s gaze flicked across my face. \u201cSeeing as how you\u2019re back, I guess she was right.\u201d\nI sighed.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Alex?\u201d she said.\n\u201cBarcelona,\u201d I said, a bit too fast. \u201cOr so I hear.\u201d Freddie\u2019s brother never liked me, and I knew he must\u2019ve blamed me for her death. I made a point of keeping track of him, for my own safety. After the first year, it became habit. Later, a strange comfort. Alex wasn\u2019t even Freddie\u2019s real brother\u2014he was ten years older, from a wealthy English family. A sort of god-brother, no blood relation. \u201cBut what does blood matter anymore,\u201d Freddie had said with a shrug. \u201cFamily is family.\u201d\nIngrid raised a penciled-in eyebrow. \u201cI know what today is. Why you\u2019re here.\u201d\nI looked away, tried to pick out a painting to focus on. All I could find were breasts and fairies, so I looked back.\n\u201cDid you notice anything strange about her, those last days?\u201d\nIngrid blinked. \u201cThere was always something strange about Freddie.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Now she was answering too quickly.\n\u201cIngrid, if you know something\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to spread rumors. About live people or dead ones.\u201d\nI flinched at the word \u201cdead\u201d. She must\u2019ve noticed, because she put the glass down and leaned across the bar. Her fingers gripped the cuff of my jacket.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s got secrets. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s things about you that she didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cNone that killed me.\u201d\nHer gaze flicked toward the back of the room. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\u201cIngrid, please. It\u2019s been three long years. Help me out.\u201d\nShe stared at me, clicking her tongue against the roof of her mouth. Her expression softened. She sighed.\n\u201cThird door on the right. Knock twice, then twice again. But if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t get mixed up in that stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d\nShe turned her back and picked out another glass to polish.\nI downed my beer and headed for the back.\nThe door was worn and the paint chipped, but the twin locks were brand new. An aluminum \u201c2\u201d hung from the center, like a room number in an old hotel. I knocked twice, then twice again. The latches clicked open. Light shone through the crack, followed by a sliver of a face. A bloodshot eyeball regarded me for an uncomfortable minute before the door swung open.\nThe doorman\u2019s head was clean-shaven, but his beard was a tangled mess. His gut hung out from beneath a tattered shirt with the word \u201cGodless\u201d in big pink lettering. His lips curled into a smile, revealing more gum than teeth.\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said in a slow, Moravian drawl.\nI slipped past him, trying to avoid bodily contact. A thick haze hung across the room. Burnt incense clung to the air. Couches lined the walls, and the floor was a minefield of battered pillows. A handful of men and women lay sprawled about the room. In the far corner, a man with lazy eyes sucked from a long pipe. At his elbow, a metal tray held a sticky, black substance.\nOpium.\nThrough a doorway obscured by hanging beads, a man walked in. Our gazes met, and he paused. It was the guy from the park, the chess player. Once or twice, I happened by while Freddie was playing a round with him. She was a shark at chess, called it \u201ca complex game of simple patterns\u201d. I never saw her lose; she\u2019d attract crowds of tourists during her more intense matches. Whenever she played, her expression went cold, as if possessed. I didn\u2019t know if she even knew how to play, before the accident.\nThe man turned around and headed for the doorway.\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said.\nHe made as if he hadn\u2019t heard me, and started to push through the beads.\n\u201cI\u2019m here about Freddie.\u201d\nHe froze. Nearby faces turned at the name, and I felt as if a spotlight had descended upon me. I strode across the room, picking my way between bodies and cushions.\n\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d I said.\nHe half-turned. His face was gaunter than I remembered, his lips thinner and the roundness of his eyes more pronounced.\nHe shook his head. \u201cFreddie\u2019s dead.\u201d\nThe casual toss of the words turned my skin hot. \u201cThat have anything to do with you?\u201d\nThe man waved me off and started through the doorway again. I grabbed him by the shoulder, and felt a roomful of gazes on my back.\n\u201cHow do you know Freddie?\u201d I said.\nHe sneered, showing a picket line of yellowed teeth. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d\nI pushed him against the wall. His head cracked into the plaster, and he winced. Shuffling ensued from behind me. The big guy from the doorway drifted over and hung in my periphery, arms folded across his chest.\nThe skinny guy raised his hands. \u201cShe was just a customer.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit. Freddie was no junkie.\u201d\nHe studied me, big eyeballs swiveling around in sunken sockets. \u201cSaid it helped her sleep. Let the dragon chase the nightmares away.\u201d\nI let out a slow breath. The whole time I knew Freddie, she barely slept. After our naked bodies slowed to a halt in the moonlight of her tiny loft, I\u2019d fall asleep with her breath hot against my neck, her green eyes watching. In the morning, I\u2019d find her dressed in one of my t-shirts, halfway through her third crossword, or studying patterns in the sea of courtyard pigeons below. Binders full of equations beyond my comprehension scattered across the floor. \u201cDream of me?\u201d she\u2019d say with a wink. She joked that the chip worked too well, that she had too much to think about. Two brains: one for the daytime, one for the nighttime. She\u2019d finished the coursework for her doctorate in less than a year. Which brain had I fallen in love with?\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a regular. But we all knew her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a salesman.\u201d\nI grabbed him by the lapels. \u201cIf you gave her bad stuff\u2014\u201d\nA pudgy hand clamped down on my neck from behind. The doorman\u2019s face swung into view.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\nMy gaze flicked from face to face. I slackened my grip, then spun and headed for the exit. At the threshold, I glanced over my shoulder. The skinny man was mashing buttons on his phone at a furious clip. He grinned at me, malice burning in his oversized eyes.\nI slipped past the bar while Ingrid\u2019s back was turned and ducked out into the night. The cold air hung heavy and damp in the alley, and in my lungs. Like rain, suspended in midair.\nNo way Freddie had died of an overdose. I was with her that night, right up to the end. She was as coherent as ever. There had to be more to the story. Our night had started at U V\u00edla, but it hadn\u2019t ended there.\n\u201cHow about a beer?\u201d Freddie had said on our way out of U V\u00edla. The thought struck her like an epiphany, lighting up her whole face. On a cold night, beer meant Pod Kroka. Their heaters were always cranked the highest.\nI hustled down the street to our old neighborhood spot. I pushed through the oak doors and descended into the pub. Loud voices and rolling laughter filled the air, as thick as the cigarette smoke. Promises of pork and dumplings wafted from the kitchen. Glasses clinked in a perpetual melody as round after round of beer made its way to the tables in the hands of bustling servers.\nI walked to the back corner of the pub, where a lone table stood guard in the shadows. Our table, on most nights. I pulled up a chair. My fingertips grazed the tabletop, tracing familiar etchings in the wood. A frantic scribble of numbers lined the edge. Freddie\u2019s handwriting. She\u2019d been trying to explain societal probabilistic analysis to me, the night she disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s just pattern recognition,\u201d she said, her eyes intense in the dim lighting. \u201cApplied to societal behaviors, it gives us the ability to predict large-scale social events. Political power shifts, social unrest, riots, you name it.\u201d It sounded plausible, but as usual she lost me in the numbers. I watched her lips move, captivated, thinking life would go on like that forever. Drinking and talking and making love until the end of time.\nThe men\u2019s restroom door creaked open, and a pale-faced man loped out. He walked up to my table and squinted at me. His long head and receding hairline were an unfortunate combination, resulting in a massive forehead. His wrinkled button-down billowed around his skinny waist, although the sleeves barely came to his elbows. He glanced at my feet. I followed his gaze. Underneath the table, a backpack lay on its side.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, standing. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize someone was sitting here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the American,\u201d he said.\nI wasn\u2019t sure if it was a question or a statement. I nodded.\nHe glanced toward the exit, then looked back. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you with\u2014with her.\u201d\nI leaned forward. \u201cFreddie?\u201d\nHe winced.\n\u201cYou knew Freddie?\u201d I said.\nHe shifted from foot to foot, eyeing his backpack. He looked ready to abandon it, in lieu of suffering through this conversation.\n\u201cI\u2019m Stepan,\u201d he said, his voice barely audible over the surrounding din. \u201cCharles University math department.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the doctorate program? The same one as Freddie?\u201d\n\u201cWas. I\u2019m a lecturer, now.\u201d\nI grabbed a second chair. \u201cPlease. I need to know what happened to her.\u201d\nHe shot the chair a suspicious glance, eventually seating himself at the edge. He snatched his backpack, and I thought he was going to turn and run. But he stayed put, clutching his bag to his chest.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be much help. She was just in our club.\u201d\n\u201cWhat club?\u201d\n\u201cD\u011bti Matematiky. The Children of Math.\u201d\nI raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cI saw you with her, sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d know about the club.\u201d\nI shook my head.\n\u201cShe was a savant,\u201d Stepan said. \u201cHer computational skills\u2014she was a walking calculator. And the pattern recognition\u2014the cryptography, the sequencing\u2026she kept getting smarter. The rest of us couldn\u2019t keep up.\u201d\n\u201cShe was great at crosswords,\u201d I said, before realizing how ridiculous it sounded.\nStepan glanced over his shoulder, his gaze lingering on the exit.\n\u201cWe used to joke that she had dual processors,\u201d he said. \u201cA second brain. When that other brain got going\u2026it was frightening. Eventually, she started attracting attention. Mostly about the cryptography, but also about her societal analysis work. Foreigners started showing up to the department, asking about her. Governments, corporations.\u201d\nI realized I was holding my breath, and let it out slowly. \u201cThen what?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cHer interests turned dark, those last weeks. Mind-control, secret societies, conspiracy theories. That second brain of hers was disturbed. She said she was trying to make sense of the chaos, trying to find the truth. She thought she was being controlled by something, or by someone. Scared the hell out of us. Some of the books she left lying around were\u2026troubling.\u201d\n\u201cDo you still have them?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. The cops took everything. With the way she was acting, we assumed she killed herself.\u201d\nI was chewing on my lip so hard I tasted blood.\n\u201cWhy are you asking about all this now?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been years.\u201d\nI shook my head. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell him that it had taken me three years to work up the nerve to come back.\nHe glanced over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d better go. I don\u2019t want to get involved in this.\u201d\nI opened my mouth to respond, but Stepan was already halfway to the door, clutching his backpack to his chest. I glanced down, let my fingers drift across Freddie\u2019s scribbled equations. Troubling. One night close to the end, I remember waking before dawn. I got up for a glass of water, and found Freddie lying spread-eagle on the living room floor, eyes locked on the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m counting to infinity,\u201d she said. \u201cCome join me.\u201d Her eyes were vacant, her jaw slack. I lay down by her side, and she twined her fingers between my own. Her skin was cold. \u201cWhat number are you at?\u201d I said. She kept staring at the ceiling, unblinking. \u201cOne,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still at one.\u201d\nI\u2019d been too afraid to break the spell. I hung there, locked in her orbit, silent and oblivious, until one day she blinked out of existence, sending me drifting alone through space.\nMy gaze swept across the room, jostling a memory from our last night here. We were getting ready to leave, when Freddie sat upright. \u201cI need some insurance,\u201d she said. We\u2019d been talking about her societal probability stuff, and I couldn\u2019t make the connection. She went to the bathroom without another word. Two minutes later, she came out with a smile. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\nI walked to the women\u2019s bathroom door. It was a one-holer, and light spilled from the crack at the bottom. I waited as casually as I could until a woman walked out. Then I slipped inside and locked the door.\nI had no idea what I was looking for. The bathroom was barely large enough to turn around in with my arms outstretched. The soles of my shoes stuck to the floor. The mirror was scratched so bad, I could barely make out my own face.\nThe walls and ceiling were covered in graffiti, some dating back over a decade. It was an even distribution of English and Czech. The English proved to be nothing more than genitalia-derived slang, angsty poetry, and local phone numbers offering sexual favors.\nKnuckles rapped against the door.\nI checked under the toilet, behind the mirror, and along the grout of the sink. I checked in the paper towel holder and behind the soap fixture. Nothing. I put my hand on the doorknob, and froze.\nMy gaze locked on a square of block lettering beside the light switch. The letters were meticulously symmetrical, and perfectly spaced. The same way Freddie filled out her crosswords. It read: \u201cHrad\u010dansk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 15, #325.\u201d Was this her insurance? Was it meant for me, or for someone else?\nMore knocking erupted from the door, followed by an impatient burst of Czech. I snapped a photo of the address with my phone, then unlatched the door. The woman outside laid into me with a string of creative profanity. I mumbled an apology and headed for the exit.\nOutside, the air had grown colder. I stuffed my hands into my pockets. Steam blasted from my nostrils. Hrad\u010dansk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed was in the Castle District, crammed with museums and souvenir booths. Freddie and I never spent much time up there. Still, it was all I had to go on.\nI walked quickly, my shoes slipping against the slick cobblestone. The night was in full swing, and revelers darted from doorway to doorway, lungs filled with drunken laughter. I breezed through the bustling Malostransk\u00e9 plaza, past the massive dome of St. Nicholas Cathedral. The fog hung thicker close to the water, and I could hardly make out the curve of the narrow road leading up to Prague Castle. It was a steep incline, and by the time I\u2019d reached the outer complex I was sweating beneath my coat.\nA crew of workers was tearing down stage equipment after a night concert in the upper plaza. I slipped into the shadows along the fence, and crept down the alley past the edge of the Archbishop\u2019s Palace. Near the back stood the unassuming entrance to the Sternberg museum. A plaque along the wall read: \u201cHrad\u010dansk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 15.\u201d The glass doors were closed. Inside, the foyer was dark.\nI glanced at the photo of the graffiti. This was the place. The second number must\u2019ve been an office, but where\u2014\nThe clanging of metal echoed down the alley. I pressed against the wall and glanced around the corner. Three men were loading folding chairs onto a cart, from a service entrance along the side of the museum. The cart had tipped over, and the men were shouting at one another. Their backs faced me.\nBefore I had time to think it through, I ducked around the corner and slipped through the service entrance. The storage dock was deserted. I spotted a pair of double-doors, and pushed through. I stood in a long hallway. The building was dark, lit only by auxiliary LEDs and the occasional sliver of light from beneath an office door. I followed the signs to the stairway and padded upstairs. The third floor looked much like the first: more hallway, more offices. Pipes groaned through the walls. Muffled voices crept from beneath closed doors. The blood pumped in my ears.\nI followed the hall around a bend, and soon I stood before a door with the number \u201c325\u201d emblazoned beside the jamb. My hand sweated against the doorknob. I drew in a deep breath, then walked inside.\nA long, cherry wood table dominated an otherwise sparse meeting room. Twelve high-backed seats lined the perimeter of the table. Before each seat was a plain black binder and a sharpened pencil. Traces of coffee and bourbon clung to the air. Voices filtered through a closed door at the back.\nI opened a binder. An unused notepad sat on the right. On the left, a single sheet indicated: \u201cMeeting Minutes.\u201d The rest of the page was blank.\nI opened the second binder, then the third. No variance. Inside the fourth, an envelope had been slipped inside the notepad. I tugged it out. The words \u201cSociety of Clay\u201d were stamped on the front. Beneath that was a circle with lines cutting through the center at odd angles.\nMy mouth went dry. It was the pattern from Freddie\u2019s necklace.\nThe back door swung open. A large, goateed man walked in. His eyes widened when he saw me.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d His voice was deep and thick; his accent was startlingly English.\nI turned and ran.\n\u201cWait!\u201d he said, keeping pace behind me. His booted footsteps carried down the hall. I tore open the door to the stairs and scrambled down. The man\u2019s shouts echoed through the stairwell. Halfway down, I tripped and landed hard on my side. The air rushed from my lungs.\nI stumbled to my feet. The man was a half-flight back and gaining. I scrambled down the stairs, struggling for breath. I shouldered through the door and into the loading dock.\nThe workers were still outside hauling chairs. I grabbed the top chair as I passed, and hurled it behind me. My pursuer let out a grunt as his legs tangled in the chair. I tore down the alley and through the courtyard, not stopping to catch my breath until I was all the way down the hill, back in Malostransk\u00e9 plaza. I ducked down a side road and pressed my back against the blackened doors of an old church.\nI stood panting until my breathing and heart rate had slowed. Then I opened my clenched hand and smoothed out the envelope. My fingers shook as I tore it along the seam.\nInside, a scrap of paper bore the letterhead of the Augustine Hotel. Written in neat cursive were three names: Ludvig Fletcher, Beatrice Stokes, and Armando Del Rio.\nI pulled out my phone. A hasty internet search of \u201cSociety of Clay\u201d produced erratic results: mostly conspiracy theory blogs and rambling anarchist sites. I pulled up some related searches, and tried connections with the three names from the paper. I skimmed through page after page of text, until my gaze landed on an excerpt from a medical journal.\n\u201cAn anonymous individual has contributed another substantial cash donation to the Neural Life Foundation and their cerebral reconstruction project. The Foundation is hopeful that the donation will be enough to support procedures on three victims of traumatic brain damage: Beatrice Stokes, Armando Del Rio, and Ludvig Fletcher. Although the donation was anonymous, some believe it to be tied to the Society of Clay, an elusive investment group from Cambridgeshire. The Society has recently been linked to a rash of criminal activity across Eastern Europe, although no formal charges have been brought against them. The cerebral reconstruction procedure was popularized by the first successful recovery from catastrophic brain damage\u2014\u201d\nHands\u2014at least four pairs\u2014grappled me and dragged me to the ground. My back slammed against the cobblestone. Before I could let out a cry for help, a gloved hand fed me a mouthful of cloth. Fabric stretched across my eyes, and everything went dark. I flailed, connecting with an elbow, then a foot. I slipped my arm free, but four more hands clamped down again, this time harder. Pain lanced up my shoulder. I gasped for air. After another futile burst of resistance, I relented. They dragged me across the ground until my spine felt ready to burst. It was all I could do to keep my head from slamming into the stones.\nA door creaked on rusted hinges. The cold night air gave way to the confines of a basement, or a garage. The air was stale and damp. They hauled me off the ground, and strapped my wrists and ankles to a wooden chair. My muscles ached, and my temples throbbed. Fingers rifled through my pockets.\nFootsteps receded. Others approached. Calloused fingers pried the gag from my mouth. I panted and wheezed in the darkness.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask the questions.\u201d The man\u2019s accent was Slavic, but too harsh for Czech.\nI held my breath.\n\u201cJohnny Black.\u201d I could hear him rifling through my wallet. \u201cRedondo Beach, California. All right, Johnny. How much do you know?\u201d\nI chewed on my lip. \u201cJust the names on that paper.\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chip, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re doing this. That\u2019s why you killed Freddie.\u201d\nThe man shifted in the darkness.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I said. \u201cSome kind of artificial intelligence you were cultivating inside her brain? Is that how you were controlling her? She found out, didn\u2019t she? She outsmarted you.\u201d\nThe silence hung all around me.\nThe man cleared his throat again. \u201cIf I said yes, would you be satisfied?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Well, no. I mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\u201cTo find the truth\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\nI choked on my response.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to absolve yourself of blame. To make yourself feel better about something that happened years ago.\u201d\nI swallowed. \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the convenient answers you\u2019re looking for. I don\u2019t know what happened to your girlfriend.\u201d\nI sat stunned, trying to find the words to continue the pursuit.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in over your head, Johnny. I suggest you leave town. Tonight.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cI represent a government.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the Society of Clay?\u201d\nThe man chuckled, a slow and derisive laugh. \u201cNo. We\u2019re after their leader. Does the word Maharal mean anything to you?\u201d\nI coughed. The name was well known around these parts, but not for anyone living. Freddie told me the story once. The Maharal was a big-shot rabbi from the sixteenth-century. Supposedly he created a golem out of clay from the banks of the Vltava River, and used the automaton to defend the city. Eventually the golem slipped from the rabbi\u2019s control, so he killed it. Something like that.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThen you might make it out of Prague alive. Before that girl\u2019s past catches up with you.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2014\u201d\nA ball of cloth muffled my words. The man left me in silence. Soon more footsteps returned, and hands grappled me. After separating me from the chair, they hauled me outside. Another grinding slog through the streets left me propped against a cold stone wall, alone. I pried the blindfold and gag free.\nI lay in a swath of shadows at the bend of an alley. Across the way, an old statue clung to the wall of a hotel. The statue depicted a hulking juggernaut, part man and part machine. His eyes were deep, triangular gouges, and a Hebrew inscription ran the length of his forehead.\nI rubbed my aching wrists. The Maharal. Leader of the Society of Clay. Silent investor of the cerebral reconstruction project. But was his golem Freddie, or the chip itself? Had she slipped beyond their control, or was everything she did part of his plan?\nI staggered to my feet. My legs and back ached. I drifted through the alleys for at least a half hour before stumbling onto a familiar street. A few turns later, I stood at the base of Charles Bridge. It was late, and the city slept.\nI trudged up the steps of the bridge. The fog had grown thicker. Like smudges on a faded canvas, the lights of Prague Castle shone through the mist. I leaned against the cold stone railing and drew in a lungful of air. My fingers found the Davidoffs in my pocket, and I sparked one to life. My lungs burned.\nI caught a hint of Freddie\u2019s musk, mixed with the swell of tobacco. The cigarette tasted like Freddie\u2019s lips, the first time she kissed me. \u201cI kissed you,\u201d she said with a grin, as if the words made it more real. I smiled and said nothing, as I so often did. Hoping the moment would last forever.\n\u201cJohnny.\u201d\nThe voice was as thick as the fog, undercut by a subtle English lilt. I didn\u2019t turn. I didn\u2019t have to.\n\u201cAlex,\u201d I said. \u201cBeen a while.\u201d\n\u201cI think we both know how long it\u2019s been.\u201d\n\u201cHeard you moved to Barcelona.\u201d\n\u201cDid you.\u201d\nI turned to face Freddie\u2019s brother. He had that same damn jacket on, the one with the high collar that he swore made him look smarter. Same damn squished face, too, that he was afraid made him look like a fool. Guess even a fool was right half the time. His hands were jammed into his pockets, and the bulge on the right couldn\u2019t have been anything but a handgun.\nHe took a step closer. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d\nI took a long pull from my Davidoff, blasting smoke over his head into the fog.\n\u201cWhat did you hope to accomplish?\u201d he said.\nI opened my mouth to respond, and it all caught up to me. This night. That night. All the nights in between. The opium, the Children of Math, the societal analysis. The mind-control and the Society of Clay. I reached my hands into my pockets, but they came out empty, save for a crumpled pack of smokes and a lighter. No cell phone, no envelope. No proof that any of it was real. No proof that Freddie ever existed at all.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said.\nThe gun shifted in Alex\u2019s pocket. A flash of gold glinted against his collar. Freddie\u2019s necklace, the one with the Society of Clay insignia. Comically fragile, dangling from his thick neck.\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d\nHe looked down. \u201cThe coroner.\u201d\nI motioned toward the handgun. \u201cWhatever happened, that\u2019s not going to make you feel any better.\u201d\nAll the air hissed out of Alex. \u201cI\u2019m not here for revenge.\u201d\nI took another drag from my cigarette. That\u2019s when I remembered. Freddie\u2019s necklace wasn\u2019t gold, it was stainless steel. The coroner had said he couldn\u2019t release the evidence, since the case was never closed. Alex never liked how close Freddie and I had gotten, and now I knew why. I was interfering with his plans.\n\u201cThe Maharal,\u201d I said. The word hung between us, heavier than the fog. Despite the gravity of the situation, I couldn\u2019t help but grimace at Alex\u2019s chosen handle, ripped shamelessly from regional Jewish lore. Alex was a blue-blooded Anglican from Cambridge \u2014 he\u2019d probably never even seen the inside of a synagogue. The name\u2019s historic weight wasn\u2019t lost on me, though, nor was the severity of its implications. I guess that was the whole point.\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve left the past in the past, Johnny. Now you\u2019re just another loose end.\u201d\nThe stone railing was cold against my back.\n\u201cWhat happened to Freddie?\u201d I said.\nHis gaze flicked away, and his eyebrows twitched. When he looked back, his expression was impassive. But it was too late. Freddie\u2019s fate was painted in that twitch, as clear as Alex\u2019s guilt. I wasn\u2019t just a loose end; I was a reminder of what he\u2019d done. I came to Prague to find the truth. Alex was here to bury it. I guess we both succeeded.\nThe fog deepened the gunshot, carrying it low across the water like rolling thunder. The momentum carried my body over the railing, toward the black silk waves of the river below. It was a long, slow fall\u2014one that had started three years prior, on a night just like this one.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk,\u201d Freddie whispered in my ear. \u201cJust you and me.\u201d She laced her fingers between mine, and drew me to my feet. She led me out into the cold night air, her body pressed against my side. I smiled and said nothing, hoping the moment would last forever.\nDerrick Boden\u2019s fiction has appeared in numerous online and print venues including Daily Science Fiction, Flash Fiction Online, and Perihelion.

The fault lies with me\u2014my stone body is split open, and my metal core mostly spilled out. I am so close to corroding into death that it is a wonder that I still understand words.\n\u201cAre you full-stone yet?\u201d The voice breaks the stillness in my cave. \u201cThey said you would be, after so long. A fool\u2019s errand.\u201d A pause. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not talking to another statue.\u201d\nI focus my eyes slowly, and sluggishly rouse myself from thoughts of the stone I aspire to be.\nOne of the mountain folk is staring at me. She is standing too close to the facets of my left eye, blurring her in my sight.\n\u201cI am here because of Rowena\u2013\u201d the woman starts, but a soft clatter interrupts her. The pile of wolf bones that rest alongside the curve of my neck shift and murmur. The bones are a friend, and it has been some time since we last spoke.\n\u201cWho?\u201d I struggle to ask. I know the words of the mountain folk, but my voice is raw, full of gravel as my iron veins rust and crumble. It is a hard task to summon any words at all, and the mortal winces as I speak, a hand reaching for her ear.\n\u201cRowena\u2013\u201d the woman starts again, and yes, it seems that I still recognize the sound of dismay.\n\u201cSpeak to the bones,\u201d I say, because they know. They can speak where I cannot.\nSo I let my eyes dim again\u2014the strain of focusing them is too much. The darkness is preferable.\nThe woman says something. Her tone rises, and I hear the bones wheeze.\nLife passes, stone breathes, and my mountain sings.\n\u201cRowena,\u201d I hear again, a word pulled sharply out of soft murmurs, and I stir.\nThe woman has returned \u2013 or has she remained? She holds the skull from the pile of bones. It is a large, cumbersome skull. It was a wolf, once, one of the giant ones that roam below the mountains.\nSurely there is no reason for a wolf to come up from the woods to die here.\nThe mortal looks up as my eye brightens again. She has done as I said, and spoken to the bones about Rowena. I know this because I can feel the pile of bones vibrating beside me, awakening as I have.\n\u201cRowena spoke to me of this wolf,\u201d the woman says. And then, \u201cIt is marvelously cruel, what they did to you. How can you bear it? How can a punishment last so long?\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The strain is as great as before.\n\u201cI am Fuller, the Fourth,\u201d the woman says clearly.\nFuller. Yes. I know the name, knowledge that rattles loosely in my memory. Lords of mountain lands they are, and they keep the miners and metal-poachers in check. The metal in our mountain ranges is vastly abundant, it multiplies even as it is pulled out of the earth. Rare and common metals are found beside each other, as they are found nowhere else.\nAs if she knows what my next question must be, Fuller continues. \u201cI come because you gave Rowena the stone-secrets. As she lay down to die, she bade me come and fetch you to finish her work. In her last moments, she must have remembered you as you were, not as you are.\u201d\nA sensation sluices through me, unexpected and troublesome. I do not remember Rowena, but the knowledge of her death makes me shiver, just slightly. My stone skin cracks as I unintentionally flex my claws. Creeping rust has eaten the spilled iron of my veins, and corrosion has even begun to nip gently at my nickel core.\nI have questions, but the words are impossible to force out; too much of me is gone. I can only shake and make a sound like rocks scraping against each other.\nFuller takes a step back, and then immediately reclaims the space she had given up. \u201cShe laid herself down, and turned to stone. If you put an ear to her granite mouth, you can hear something. The wind, or murmurs. Secrets.\u201d\nThe pile of bones rattles and shakes beside me.\nFuller glances down at the bones, silent for a moment as she watches them, before she finally continues: \u201cOn her death, the wolves howled for three days, but there are no more wyrms except for you, here, and the last wyrms of the Elder Range. They have grown erratic, paranoid, and cruel since Rowena first went to your cave and came away with secrets. They offered no mourning for Rowena.\u201d\nHow long has it been? A shiver runs through me, a trembling in my mind of unfortunate truths that were threatening to emerge. Something wells up in me, a feeling so vast I can barely feel the edges of it\u2014I have only an impression of devastation. If I press hard, I remember being on trial before the wyrms of the Elder Range, or I remember the shade of the memory: it happened, but all that is left is the aftertaste of rage and impotence.\nTo give a mortal our stone-secrets is high treason among the stone-wyrms. This thought emerges like a brand, overshadowing anything else.\nWhy had I done it?\nAnd deeper, more distressing: what has happened to my kind, that only a few wyrms remain?\nFuller takes a shaky breath. Rowena was important to her, as it seems Rowena must once have been important to me. \u201cYou are almost corroded out, and your hind legs have merged with the stone of the cavern. How am I to bring you back to Rowena\u2019s garden, as she asked?\u201d\nThe wolf bones roll away from me, up the slope of my cave so that they pile at Fuller\u2019s feet.\n\u201cCarry me back, instead,\u201d the bones whisper. They sound yearning, and demanding, and something in me responds. This is good, this will be right. \u201cCarry me. Bury me there. I am not a wyrm, but I have learned to carry their hymn.\u201d\nFuller does not hear the wolf, I realize. She does not have the ear for understanding the stone-secrets that lurk in the wolf\u2019s bones and give them this awareness.\nI strain against the weakness of my body, try to shift myself towards Fuller. I almost rise.\nInstead, movement tears the gaping crevasse in my cracked stone chest still further. Clumps of rusted iron fall from me, followed by drips of uncorroded iron which cool and harden as the air touches it.\nI do not understand mortal expressions, but perhaps Fuller is horrified as she hurriedly sets the skull down and stumbles over the bones to lay a staying hand on my long neck.\nShe says soothing words, but the contact is what I need.\n\u201cTake the wolf to Rowena, and bury him there,\u201d I tell her, whispering through the stone of my skin, my iron speaking to the scant iron in her blood.\nMy mountain trembles around me. The eternal hymn that resonates through stone and metal around us loses its rhythm. I sense the edge of profound loss, but I do not know whose it is: the wolf\u2019s, the mountain\u2019s, or mine.\n\u201cI will bring you with me, old friend,\u201d the wolf says to me. \u201cHave no fear. You are not abandoned. We share the same stone-secrets, we sing the same hymn now, and you will have use of my eyes.\u201d\nIt is better than nothing, so Fuller leaves with the wolf\u2019s bones. I close my eyes, and I croon a little lullaby to my mountain, as best I can. The spiders that live in my shadow calm around me, while one of the darker things in the deep of my mountain harmonizes to an age-old song. It is almost soothing.\nI expect to sleep again, but when my eyes dim, I feel them opening elsewhere. I see snatches of a mountain \u2013 my mountain, I realize belatedly, and something sweet shifts in me at the long-forgotten sight of the sun setting over the rim of my mountain\u2019s peak. Fuller has the skull strapped to her back, and the image lingers in the shared sight of the skull and I.\nThe other mountains in the range rise along the horizon, and loss crawls up my throat. But mourning is something for the folk, not the wyrms. The unnatural feeling seeps through me, sits in me, until I realize that just as I am connected to the wolf\u2019s bones through shared secrets, I have been exposed to mortal feelings through the secrets I gave Rowena.\nI rust, and the mountain sings, and I see the land falling behind me.\nFuller joins the company of others, men and women with stern faces, wearing steel. The iron in that alloy whisper of the mountains they came from, lineages that mean nothing to me anymore. The men and women hold conversations that have no bearing for me, and it all slips away through rising suns and falling evenings.\nI slip in and out of this consciousness, until I hear a song through the wolf-bones. The song fills a place in me that I had forgotten was empty, settles in and makes my whole body shake. Through the skull, I see that the sun is hard and bright, outlining every detail of a small courtyard garden. Alongside the neat dirt paths are stones that have been carefully chosen for size and color to decorate the space.\nAt the center of the stone garden is a statue of a woman. The woman is lying atop a long stone bench, one arm crossed over her chest, the other resting alongside her body, the palm of her hand open. The face of the woman has been carved so that the eyes are open, direct, staring into the distance forever, the mouth down-turned.\nI know her.\n\u201cRowena,\u201d I say, feeling like calling to like across a vast distance. The skull begins to shake in Fuller\u2019s hands.\nThe secrets that are sunk deep into Rowena unfurl, reaching out to me. They are sweet, and if I could just swallow them back in, I would know what Rowena has done with them. I would understand why I was cracked open and left to rust in my mountain.\n\u201cOld friend,\u201d I hear faintly, raspy words that sound like they are coming home. \u201cIt has been too long.\u201d\nAnd then Rowena is dead, gone, the secrets in her swallowed by the wolf instead. All her works rendered to nothing more than stone, a memorial in a tiny garden that grows no plants. Did she succeed in\u2013?\nThe memory isn\u2019t there, and my thoughts scatter as I try to chase it.\n\u201cDo you hear it?\u201d The wolf speaks softly across the vast distance between us. \u201cThe lives buried around us?\u201d\nI do. Now that the wolf has called my attention to it, I can feel the pulsing of metal buried in the earth around us as Fuller sets the bag holding the wolf\u2019s bones down on the carefully arranged stones of the garden. Metal worked in a forge, and yet waiting to be awakened and called out of the earth as if it were the natural ore that forms a wyrm\u2019s core. I can taste flavors of familiar metals \u2014 copper, nickel, others \u2014 but I do not have names for these new alloys.\nThey are unknown to the wolf as well, but I sense that the wolf is proud of them, of what Rowena\u2019s hands brought into being. \u201cI wish you had been able to come here. I wish you could have sung the mountain hymns to this garden, as Rowena intended. But I will do it for you, old friend.\u201d\nFuller does the work of burying the bones herself, moving stones and then plunging her hands deep into the rich dark soil. From the wolf\u2019s eyes, I have learned that Fuller is tall and broad for a mortal, that she has strength enough to impress the wolf. That she has survived scores of years.\nHow many years has the wolf been dead? Long enough, it seems, that the mountain hymns that nourish all wyrms have sunk into its bones. The wolf can sing this metal awake, but who will guide the wyrmlings that crawl out of this stone garden?\nI have not forgotten what Fuller told me in those hazy first moments of awakening, and I turn my thoughts towards the Elder Range. The peaks of those mountain soar into the sky like they would rip it open. If Fuller has spoken truly, then the wyrms of the Elder Range are all that is left of us. They are the oldest of all our kind, formed of noble metal that never corrodes. Surely I must have made these plans with Rowena and the wolf when more wyrms lived, when these wyrmlings would not be left alone to the mercy of the Elder Range?\nI fear a new generation of wyrms raised in the shadow of the Elder Range. It is a deep, instinctive fear that causes me to shudder in my cave, and I have a vision \u2013 a memory \u2013 of an Elder Wyrm crawling towards me, snarling, flecks of corroded titanium flying from eir throat as ey scream at me.\nThey blamed me for their corrosion. By giving the secrets to Rowena, a high treason that caused\u2013\nThe thought is gone.\nFuller leaves the wolf-skull for last. She approaches, and as she touches it, that distant connection asserts itself again.\n\u201cWhere did they go?\u201d I ask, as soon as she does. \u201cWhat happened to the last of my kind while I was cut open to die in my mountain?\u201d\n\u201cThe wyrm-plague,\u201d Fuller says. Blunt, direct, a recitation of history that keeps her own feelings held close to her chest. \u201cHealthy wyrms corroded from the inside out. The mountains gave up no more ore to be raised into new wyrms. No rhyme or reason to it, just that it left the ranges unguarded, and the plains folk began to poach the metal. They claim innocence to the plague, of course, and we mountain folk and wolves are left struggling to protect the mountains.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say, because it is impossible to understand such devastation so calmly stated. But I believe it, because my range-siblings died shrieking as corrosion burned through their iron veins, before Rowena first came to see me.\nI turn away from the memory. I do not want to recall those losses, do not want to measure my siblings\u2019 swift demises with my long return to stone.\nFuller draws in a breath, and steadies herself. \u201cAnd I do not understand either. What are these secrets you gave Rowena? What about them was so terrible that the wyrms of the Elder Range punished you so grievously?\u201d\nShe pauses, cups a hand over her mouth, and I do not know what emotion she is trying to hide from a creature of stone.\n\u201cShe was already old, long-lived but old, when I was young,\u201d Fuller continues, \u201cand she scared me. Her single mind of purpose, the metals she made in her forge, how she buried them in her garden here. She never saw folk after she left your cave. Just metal. But my grandmother remembered Rowena from before she took stone-secrets.\u201d\nFuller prepares a place to bury the wolf-skull. She speaks as she works, telling me the stories her grandmother told her, and recognition blooms in my head. The shale of my memory shifts.\nThrough the connection of her hand on the wolf-skull, I speak to her, the words moving between us in a place deeper than spoken word: \u201cRowena found me because the wolf led her to me, we three kindred souls.\u201d We had planned this together, until the Elder Range found me out, and the wolf came limping back to my side, mortally wounded from an encounter with a wyrm gone mad with rust. And Rowena was left alone, carrying on our work as best she could.\nThen the memory is gone, turned over in my mind.\nIt is only now that I realize that Rowena, as her kind knew her, had died in my cave, long ago.\nI do not understand the urge I have to mourn Rowena the same way Fuller\u2019s grandmother did. It is not fitting of a wyrm, and yet I cannot deny it.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Fuller says, eventually. \u201cFor letting me fulfill Rowena\u2019s last request.\u201d\nSurely I am the one who should thank Fuller, who honored a woman who had been strange and cold to her, and in so doing became the last piece of the chain that carried a desperate plan to completion. How many other hands must there have been, among folk, among wyrms and wolves, aiding us in this task and now entirely forgotten to me?\nShe lets the last handful of earth fall over the wolf-skull, burying it completely. We are left to sing to the buried metal, and awaken them.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I ask the wolf, in between measures of the hymn. \u201cWhy give your life, and your death, too, to this?\u201d\n\u201cWolf, wyrm, and mountain folk. We have a balance to keep between us. Although the old wyrms will never know that wolf and mountain folk fulfilled our sworn oath, their death does not erase our obligations.\u201d\nThe wolf\u2019s thoughts fade from me, focused on the lives waiting to awaken.\nWe would none of us see the results of this work that took all our lives. It may be work that comes to nothing, if the metal does not wake. And yet, I know that in the years of my life undone by the Elder Range, I have never regretted giving Rowena and the wolf my stone-secrets.\nTime passes, moments slip away, and I fall helplessly into deeper and deeper sleep. My incarceration is smeared impressions, suggestions of stone creeping through me, and the echo of silence. I am almost corroded out, so very little of me left.\n\u201cThey said you should be returned to stone by now.\u201d I hear a voice that resonates through the stone. \u201cBut that the secrets you shared with mortals has kept you alive past the point of death.\u201d\nMy eyes are sealed over, but I can recognize the sound of youth. A wyrmling, not yet harder than sandstone.\nI ache at being woken. I do not know why the wyrmling\u2019s presence makes me want to shatter.\nI can hear the wyrmling scraping eir claws through the floor of my cavern. Rude, but I am too tired to care.\nI have words only through the faint echoes of my mountain\u2019s hymn. It takes me enough time to remember how to make use of the hymn to speak through the stone, that I can sense the wyrmling turning, leaving.\n\u201cWhat range are you formed from?\u201d I speak, and sense the wyrmling stop.\nThe words are slow in coming, like the wyrmling is weighing what to tell me. \u201cI have no mountain. I grew out of metal buried in a garden. They buried the bones of the wolf-friend there, and the secrets in them turned into mountain-hymns, sunk back into the stone, and raised us.\u201d\nRelief. I do not know why or where, but I feel relief.\nIn the silence while more words wait to rise between us, I hear old, sickly bats murmur and shiver in the darkness far above me. The wyrmling continues, softly. \u201cThe Elder Range is gone. The plague took them, in the end. But we rose from the ground, our veins run with alloyed metal that is resistant to the plague. We are not quite formed true. We dream of the wolves howling and the folk\u2019s hammers more often than not. The mountains do not quite accept us.\u201d\nMy attention is waning, crushed under the exhaustion of being awake and this onslaught of words, and the world around me seems to be only slivers and pieces that are hard to catch. What can I say to these words that carry so little meaning to me?\n\u201cI came because I wanted to see this mountain that haunts the edge of the hymn in my head, this mountain that I sometimes dream of. Now that I am here, I would rather go back and run with the wolves.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I say, not really following. \u201cWell, bring my mountain\u2019s greetings to yours.\u201d\nIt is only polite, after one wyrm visits another. I am sure I have a range-cousin who insists on it.\nMy mind falls back inside myself, and I hear the wyrmling speak as if from a great distance. \u201cI\u2026had hoped to speak with you, rather than rely on the echoes of your guidance in the hymn that raised us. I know why you did this, why I live. I do not know if I can thank you for it.\u201d\nAnother pause, and then, so very quietly. \u201cIt is time for you to sleep. It is not right that you\u2019ve been left this way for so long, punished far beyond the measure of the transgression.\u201d\nThe wyrmling starts singing, something sweet and soft that draws me into it.\nDeep inside this song, an old mountain hymn echoes, known only in the nascent moments before my kind rises from the stone, and forgotten during the weight of living. The world, my mountain, the wyrmling, all of them fall away as I sink into the hymn.\nA final thought surfaces, a memory of a woman standing in my cave. A memory made free after everything else is carved away.\n\u201cYour spiders are larger than I am, but I think I\u2019ve frightened them off,\u201d Rowena says, and laughs. The sound nestles comfortably into the shape of my hymn. It is good to see her again.\nShe carries a jar with her, full of a red-gold liquid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gold,\u201d she says, \u201cdissolved. I can reconstitute it, bring gold back from the dead, but I cannot solve rust in the same manner, or this slow corrosion that now plagues even the Elder Range, and you as well. How can it be that the air which lets the wolves and the folk live strong is the same slow fire that burns away all metal, and brings you as low as time does us?\u201d\nThe mountains are empty around us, and grow emptier. My cousins to the south were an iron range, my cousins to the east were copper. The nickel in my range has died out, leaving only me as the last. The mountains are not calling new wyrms up to replenish the fallen. Rowena suspects a plague was set upon us by the plains folk, to eliminate we wyrms who guard and nourish and protect our mountains and its metal.\nWe three, wyrm, mountain folk, and wolves, carry a careful balance between us. We keep out those who would rip all of the metal in the mountains away, or hunt the wolves down to the last, or replace the current folk with new folk.\n\u201cYou have a plan?\u201d I say.\n\u201cI need to know the secrets of your metals and stone. I will fashion new metals in my forge, ones that are as long-lived as tungsten or titanium, if I dare to aspire so high. I will sink them back into the earth, and if you sing them awake, maybe new wyrms can rise that are resistant to this corrosion that seeps up from the plains.\u201d\nIt is treason for a wyrm to pass on our secrets to mortals. We keep a balance. Our secrets can become a weapon against us.\nBut I sat with my range-siblings as they died. What is treason against my kind, if there are no more wyrms to trespass against? Rowena asks for much, and I must trust that she will give back even more.\nI give her the secrets. After, my wolf-friend trots in from his woods, and I give him the secrets too, for we must keep a balance between wyrm, folk, and wolf.\nWyrms do not change like mortals do over the course of a life. I did not think my stone-secrets could change a mortal so deeply, and Rowena surely did not expect how differently wyrms thought. Nor did I think that mortal feelings would crawl inside me in the exchange. The secrets turned the wolf away from the call of her pack, and maybe\u2013\nMaybe the Elder Range were not entirely wrong to forbid us from spinning our mountain hymns into secrets that mortal minds could understand. But we have all changed together, and perhaps a new balance will hold.\nI follow the thought into a final sleep.\nNatalie Ritter is a writer and sometimes reviewer of speculative fiction, and her work has also appeared in Lackington\u2019s.

You get used to it. Eventually, you realize that wrinklies aren\u2019t so bad. In fact, they\u2019re like normal people \u2013 just more open about it.\n\u201cOh, Saja, it was awful. They took him out of the autowomb and showed him to us! Can you imagine?\u201d My heart raced at the memory \u2013 the plumdark prune where a face should have been, all creases and crinkles and corrugation. \u201cIt was like packing material. Dirty packing material.\u201d\n\u201cEw.\u201d A slight tightening of the eyes showed her distaste. Saja\u2019s facial masking emphasized curves and exaggerated her features \u2013 a deliberate rejection of the fashion for flat planes and minimalized noses. \u201cWhich one of you did he look like?\u201d A smile flickered past lush, graceful lips\n\u201cFunny.\u201d As if I would know. I\u2019d never seen myself without masking, let alone Brendan. \u201cWe were pretty shaken up.\u201d\n\u201cI can imagine, Jene.\u201d Saja\u2019s color was a delicate mauve on the cheeks, deepening to rich brownish clay on the temples and brow. I wondered whether she\u2019d give me the design. Probably not. She\u2019s paid to be a trend-setter, and I\u2019m as far from trends as you can get. \u201cI hear babies look like something out of Wrinkletown.\u201d The city\u2019s twelfth district, set aside for those disturbed souls who chose to go unmade. \u201cHe looks normal enough now, anyway.\u201d\nWe looked at the cradlebot, just inserting a nipple between my son\u2019s plump red lips. He took it with a happy gurgle.\n\u201cYes, well, the nurse took him and gave him to the smoother right away. There\u2019s a job I wouldn\u2019t take.\u201d The mere thought was repulsive. \u201cLooking at unmade babies all day long. A whole day of it. It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to do it. Be thankful it\u2019s not you.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose. Though with the amount we paid for gene-mods, you\u2019d think he\u2019d have just been born\u2026you know\u2026presentable.\u201d\n\u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d She glanced over at the cradle where Enrique\u2019s cheeks glowed with carefully applied good health. \u201cIs this his look?\u201d\nWas that a touch of condescension? Brendan and I had chosen a conservative look, one we felt could last for years before redesign. Was it too traditional, too boring? \u201cWe thought it would work initially,\u201d I said with caution.\n\u201cOh yes. He looks fine. Very \u2018I\u2019m a baby\u2019.\u201d I winced. \u201cWhenever you do decide to update, let me know if you want me to take a look.\u201d\nBrendan and I had argued about that point when she made her first offer, before the birth. Brendan was in sales, and thought we didn\u2019t need some \u2018celeb\u2019 giving us tips. I told him there was no call to be nasty, and it all got worse from there.\n\u201cThanks, sis. Will do.\u201d\n\u201cNot that he doesn\u2019t look good now. Traditionalism is making a comeback.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d Anything to change the subject.\n\u201cGood!\u201d A gentle smile curled the tips of her mouth at just the right angle. \u201cKrasiv & Bella just sent me their latest kit \u2013 reaches all the way around the head. It can even redistribute follicles, see?\u201d She turned to show me the back of her neck. It looked long and bare and just the same as always.\n\u201cVery nice.\u201d\n\u201cA little painful, but\u2026\u201d She shrugged and rose. \u201cAnyway. I have to go.\u201d She leaned down to kiss my brow. \u201cAnd turn down the gloss a little on your eyeshine maybe?\u201d She winked; friendly advice to the dowdy brother, no offense intended.\n\u201cBye, Saj. Thanks for listening.\u201d Saja wasn\u2019t much of a listener, but I\u2019d had to tell someone, and it wasn\u2019t the kind of story you could share with colleagues or casual acquaintances. \u201cMy moment in the dark ages.\u201d When people had walked around with faces naked for everyone to see, forcing each other to stare at every blotch and bruise and birthmark. Birthmarks! The very concept was grotesque.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll grow on you. Next I see you, you\u2019ll be a full-fledged wrinkly,\u201d she teased, and closed the door behind her.\nA wrinkly. I shuddered, telling the housebot to clear the dishes. Could anyone really go out in public unmade? They couldn\u2019t legally, of course; not outside Wrinkletown. But who would have the courage, even there, among other wrinklies?\nThe whole idea made me faintly nauseous, and I stepped into my prepper. The door closed and locked firmly, and I turned the manual lock as well. The solid thunk of the bolt was reassuring \u2013 snug in my own little well of privacy, safe from peering eyes and cameras and recorders, without judges other than myself, and that was plenty. The telltales in the mirror glowed green to confirm my seclusion.\nI slid onto the little stool, leaned my face into the soft mask of the painter. No fancy wraparound model here \u2013 just a dependable, high-end conservative one with a hair attachment. Saja had programmed it for me, initially, but I had toyed with the parameters a little. Too much, perhaps. I dialed down the eyeshine a little. The avatar looked dull, and I added a little blue to compensate. That fit poorly with my loamy skin tone. I played with options for a while, steadily making matters worse.\n\u201cJust wipe it,\u201d I said in frustration. \u201cNo!\u201d I closed my eyes just as the avatar turned a dull khaki, the nose too big, the lips too thin. \u201cApply Saja 1,\u201d I said hurriedly. The design was a good two years old, but Saja was a leader, not a follower. The design might be dated, but it would still work.\nAll through the afternoon, as I outlined a report for the desk to write, I was distracted by the specter of a coarse nose hulking above lips like dry planks. Was that how I looked? When the outline was done, the desk compiling, I sought solace in cookery, ignoring the house\u2019s predicted match in favor of creativity. I chose basil, zucchini, seitan, buckwheat, played with spices and cooking styles until I had something novel, and scheduled it to cook.\nIt was a disaster, of course. Brendan had had a long day of meetings, negotiating new water rights for the Gorge. I could see the irritation in his eyes, the slight flush that even his careful masking couldn\u2019t hide. He looked across the artful table of grilled and toasted delicacies and told the house to make him a sandwich.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d he asked, making conversation as the house slid a perfectly toasted sandwich in front of him \u2013 dark rye with zucchini and seitan strips. We both stared at it until he forced a smile.\n\u201cFine. Eats well. Sleeps well.\u201d I strove for something less anodyne. \u201cSaj was by. She says hello.\u201d She\u2019d said no such thing, and he knew it.\n\u201cGive her my love.\u201d He quirked a perfect eyebrow to share the joke, declare a truce.\n\u201cBren,\u201d I blurted, knowing the moment was wrong. \u201cHave you ever wondered what you look like?\u201d\n\u201cI know exactly-\u201d\n\u201cNo, not your face. I mean, beneath the face. What you really look like.\u201d In for a penny. \u201cUnmade.\u201d\nThe false cheer drained from the smooth white of his face. \u201cIs this about the baby? The attendant\u2019s been fired, the nurse penalized. There\u2019s nothing more to think about.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Yes. I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026\u201d What did I? \u201cI was just curious, is all. In the prepper today, I -\u201d\n\u201cWhat you do in the prepper is for you to think about.\u201d Evidently marriage only took us so far. \u201cLook, Jene.\u201d The epitome of reasonableness. \u201cMaybe we should reconsider talking to someone. It\u2019s a\u2026 a shock, seeing a baby like that. No one should have to see their own son without cosmetics. I can understand if it\u2019s\u2026 troubling you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, fine. But that\u2019s not the point. I\u2026\u201d I decided to leave it alone. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d And I would be. It had been a moment\u2019s curiosity, that was all.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d He took a bite of sandwich, wiped a smear of oil from his cheek. The masking self-repaired, showing just a trace of dark stubble before it vanished again under a surface of serene porcelain.\nOver the next few weeks, the mental images persisted, and I spent hours looking at my carefully programmed face in the prepper, running a gentle finger over a nose that looked perfectly average. Occasionally, I played a game of chicken with the painter, giving careless commands to wipe my masking, closing my eyes just as the avatar cleared, knowing that someday I would slip, would see again the face beneath my face \u2013 my real face, I began to call it.\nI confided one day in Saja, with a wince that my masking surely transformed into a glance of mild concern.\n\u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \u201cHave you never seen yourself naked?\u201d\n\u201cWell, naked, yes.\u201d I was reasonably fit for my age. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUnmade is the same. There\u2019s no need to be ashamed, Jene, unless you go out in public.\u201d She pursed lips now painted a pale blue that contrasted sharply with translucent black skin. \u201cEven that, if you want.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on, Saj. I just asked -\u201d\n\u201cWell, why shouldn\u2019t you go out unmade, if you want to?\u201d\n\u201cHold on, now. I\u2019m not a wrinkly. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d\n\u201cNo reason you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve done it too.\u201d\n\u201cGone out! Surely not.\u201d\n\u201cWell, not that, no. But I\u2019ve looked at myself in the prepper.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d It seemed tame, in contrast. \u201cAnd?\u201d\nShe smiled her perfect smile. \u201cNot so bad.\u201d\n\u201cReally!\u201d\n\u201cReally. Wrinkly, of course. Spotted, even. I have,\u201d she winked, \u201cfreckles. Real ones.\u201d They\u2019d been in fashion five years back.\n\u201cReally? How did you\u2026 What do you look like?\u201d\n\u201cWant to see?\u201d\n\u201cNo! That\u2019s\u2026 You\u2019re my sister!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sexual, Jene.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t, but it was revolting, wrong. And enticing.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll try it myself,\u201d I said to move things along. In the privacy of my prepper.\n\u201cYou should.\u201d She patted my hand, brown masking on black. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re a redhead.\u201d\nI laughed. We\u2019d always mocked the kids who tested the edges of fashion, aimed to shock with extreme looks. I\u2019d kept my own hair within a narrow range of brown for years.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\nOver the next month, I spent more and more time in the prepper, taking longer and longer glimpses of my unmade avatar. Eventually, I came to moment I had dreaded and anticipated.\n\u201cWipe it,\u201d I said firmly. The avatar obligingly faded to its now familiar dingy khaki color, the nose a jutting promontory, the lips a mere suggestion of arc. \u201cRemove masking,\u201d I said, with slightly less certainty. The image blanked as the painter began its weekly cleansing. I felt my skin tingle as the layers peeled, as exfoliants were scrubbed on, wiped off. I felt raw, exposed, and I waited unconsciously for the gentle, soothing cream base that presaged a fresh masking. It didn\u2019t come. I\u2019d set no new painting program. I breathed deep and leaned back.\n\u201cNo masking applied,\u201d warned the screen, flashing red \u2013 black \u2013 red as I lifted my face, eyes still closed. The air felt cold on my cheeks, and I felt fragile, as if a puff of breath could sear me, mark me, leave a scar to buff away.\nI sat, uncertain, with the bright lights of the prepper forcing their way through my eyelids to set violet stains growing, shifting, merging, fading to lilac. Was I ready to face the mirror? Could I face my raw self, my impurities exposed at last, my dark secret thoughts evident to a passing glance? I snapped my eyes open before I could consider further.\nIt was\u2026 coarse. The skin, a light oatmeal mix of mushroom flecked with sand, was pitted and mined with gross pores, shot through with light blue canals of blood beneath the marbled surface. The nose was a sharp spine terminating in a flat tip with huge, gaping nostrils. Pale blue irises peered out of dingy white mapped in thin red threads. At the outer corners, nets of skin gathered tight against encroaching age. My hair was a weave of dark auburn mixed with dusty grey.\nIt was crude, like an artist\u2019s base, before the final surface was applied. Yet it looked like me. Not the me I was accustomed to seeing, the one that Brendan kissed good night, the one that had greeted my squalling, crinkled son, but a me that felt like me. It smiled when I smiled \u2013 a full-face symphony of motion, the lips crooked unevenly, the pale eyes narrowed and wrinkled, the cheeks folding into a relief of thin seams and joints \u2013 a far cry from the sleek, subtle aspect I showed the world. It was genuine, majestic, and its ruined beauty cut me to the quick. A tear trembled in one eye, and I blinked, but no masking wicked it away unseen. It trickled wet and cold down a maze of obstacles, turning left at this lump, right at that chasm, to finish at my upper lip, with its dark speckles of shaved but shadowed hair. I touched the moisture with one finger, marveled at the delicate sensitivity of bare lips, tasted salt, felt it drying on my cheek.\n\u201cBrendan will arrive in twenty minutes,\u201d announced the house. Its cold, matter-of-fact tone broke the spell, left me staring not at an exquisite portrait of Truth, but at a wrinkly \u2013 a coarse-featured gargoyle, weathered and withered by exposure.\nI plunged my face back into the kit. \u201cSaja 2,\u201d I blurted. By the time Brendan opened the door, I was the Jene he knew and loved \u2013 as much the real me as anything he\u2019d ever seen. He kissed my full, smooth lips, and all was well.\n\u201cMy kit broke the other day,\u201d Saja said.\nI shrugged. Cosmetic companies delivered kits to her every week to endorse, review, occasionally excoriate.\n\u201cI went out,\u201d she said. I shrugged again. \u201cOut,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cOh! You mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUnmade. Down the street and back.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a risk? I mean\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not against the law to go unmade, so long as you stick to walled districts. Wrinkletown. The name tasted stale, unwholesome.\n\u201cI met two friends. They congratulated my bold new look.\u201d She smiled, delighted. \u201cOne asked for the program.\u201d\n\u201cYou could start a new trend.\u201d Here was a way forward! \u201cCall it something clever, give out a null program.\u201d\n\u201cSay it automatically individualizes the look,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt would be fun, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes! What could we call it? \u2018Natural\u2019, or \u2018Fresh\u2019, or \u2026\u201d\n\u201cNude.\u201d\n\u201cI love it! Look, let\u2019s -\u201d I stopped, regarded her calm mask, now of pale jasper with hair of jet. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it, do you?\u201d\n\u201cReally sell the program?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt would be fun, but it wouldn\u2019t go far. There\u2019s no real money in it. Besides, what if it caught on?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it did?\u201d\n\u201cOh Jene, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re really caught up in this, aren\u2019t you? Be serious. I went out for twenty minutes, unmade, and already my skin changed color. I could feel it burning. The next day, I had more freckles than before. Imagine, if I did that every day!\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIn any case, how would I change my look? You wouldn\u2019t want to look the same every day, would you? I mean, most people wouldn\u2019t. And if I did, who would follow me? Who would pay me?\u201d\nWe left it at that. I said no more about my experimentation, my weekly self-examination. I scheduled my weeklies now when Brendan was at the office. We no longer engaged in our morning ritual of mutual appraisal, our small efforts to surprise each other, to deserve the minor compliments we gave each other more now by rote than out of interest. We focused instead on Enrique, with no better result.\n\u201cLook, Jene,\u201d Brendan said at last, exasperated. \u201cI understand if you want to make yourself grotesque, wandering around with scarcely any masking. At least you work from home. But the baby is another question. Look at him!\u201d\nWe looked down at a wriggling, burbling child, eyes bright as he grabbed at a toy dangled by the cradlebot, tried to stuff the toy\u2019s smooth plastic into pudgy cheeks mottled with healthy pink. A thin layer of saliva smeared down his double chin.\n\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not! He\u2019s a freak! When I wanted to show a picture of him the other day, I had to have the desk doctor one up, so he\u2019d look partway normal. Anila Bates from network ads asked if he was sick!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s perfectly healthy.\u201d\n\u201cI know he is. But look at him.\u201d\n\u201cI have. Have you, Brendan? Have you ever seen your son without his masking?\u201d\nHis face, for once so mobile, froze. \u201cWhat have you been doing, Jene?\u201d\n\u201cLooking at our son the way he is. It\u2019s not illegal, Brendan.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not. But it\u2019s not normal, Jene. It has to stop. You have to stop. Look, I want you to talk to Saja. She says she started you off on this. Maybe she can bring you back.\u201d\nSilence. \u201cYou talked with Saja?\u201d I asked at last.\n\u201cYes! I\u2019m worried about you, Jene.\u201d A trace of the man I married peeked out through the margins of his masking, and my heart warmed. This was the man I\u2019d given my heart. \u201cIt\u2019s getting so that we can\u2019t go anywhere. People might see you.\u201d And this was not.\n\u201cI can fix that,\u201d I answered stiffly, and took my righteous anger to the solitude of the prepper. Inside, I took off my masking, and watched tears flow slowly down my face, leaving slick, salty trails to show their passing. After an hour, Brendan knocked and called my name. I watched my reflection in the mirror as, calmly, serenely, it didn\u2019t answer. Eventually he went away.\nThe next day, Enrique and I, masked in matching sepia skin with chestnut hair, went out. We hailed a cab, directed it to the edge of the twelfth district, near a cafe I liked. It was a thin pretense, if Brendan checked the charges, but it was something. Enrique strapped tight to my chest, I walked down one block to the walls that marked off Wrinkletown. A guard stood at the edge, but he did no more than give us a \u2018takes all kinds\u2019 look as we passed in. His function was to prevent the unmade from getting out.\n\u2018Welcome to Wrinkletown!\u2019 offered a bright, tattered sign. \u2018Be yourself.\u2019 The streets were dirty, as if they saw only occasional cleaning. I watched a crumpled candy wrapper flutter down the street before circling at a corner and settling in the gutter. Above it, a sign offered fresh juice, and I walked toward it.\nThe proprietor was a wrinkly, or near one. He wore a thin layer of masking, perhaps hiding minor blots, but doing nothing to disguise a lump on the side of his nose, or an imperfectly shaven cheek.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he said skeptically. \u201cHelp you?\u201d\n\u201cSome juice, please. Uh, grapefruit.\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off him, off the uneven stubble that dangled from his gaunt left cheek, so different from the smooth, equally gaunt right one. So flawed; so public.\nHe nodded. One long, unshaven hair waggled slightly with the motion.\n\u201cHere you go,\u201d he said, sliding a scratched but immaculately clean glass across the counter. a paper-wrapped straw beside it. \u201cDon\u2019t get a lot of kids in with the gawpers,\u201d he nodded at Enrique. \u201cTraining him young, are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Gawpers. He meant me. \u201cNo! No, not gawping. I\u2026\u201d How could I explain to a stranger my perverse prepper habits?\n\u201cAh.\u201d He looked more closely at my masking, and I could feel the thin cover falling apart under the sheer pressure of his gaze. I wanted to touch my cheek, see if the flakes were already starting to peel off, or if it was coming off in long sheets that would dangle off my chin like wattles. \u201cWelcome, then,\u201d he said more warmly. He nodded at the baby again. \u201cHe\u2019s welcome too.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I sipped my juice, through a straw, since the acid strips away lipmask. \u201cHow\u2026 do you\u2026\u201d I waved a hand in vague indication.\n\u201cGet along?\u201d He smiled, a great chasm of cheer that showed rough lips and yellowed teeth. \u201cWell enough.\u201d He waved out the window. \u201cThe services don\u2019t ever seem to come on time, mind you, and to buy the good stuff, we have to mask up and go out. But well enough, aside from that.\u201d\n\u201cIs it \u2026 hard?\u201d\nHe knew I wasn\u2019t asking about shopping. \u201cNot a bit of it. It\u2019s comfortable, in a way, always seeing faces you know, recognize. Love. And they do change, you know.\u201d\n\u201cAge.\u201d Wrinkles, spots, signs of decay.\n\u201cAge. Wrinkles and blotches. Slumps and stoops. Wisdom and experience. Laughter and learning. It\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d He appraised me, shrugged. \u201cMaybe not you.\u201d\nWas I to be rejected so quickly, before I had even started? A part of me felt immense relief at this reprieve from imagined, predicted battles. The vocal part objected. \u201cMaybe. Maybe it is me.\u201d\nHe looked at me again, at Enrique, pudgy limps dangling, a thread of drool just starting to drip down his fat neck to be absorbed by masking. \u201cTell you what. Take this.\u201d He slipped a thin leaflet from a box on the counter. \u201cTake it home. Read it. Think about it. If you want to, check it out.\u201d\nI took the leaflet, held it in sweaty hands. \u2018The Naked Truth,\u2019 it read. \u2018Life without masks.\u2019 There was an address in the twelfth district.\n\u201cKeep that private,\u201d the man advised. \u201cBest that way. If you come back, the office is on the Blemish \u2013 the square.\u201d He smiled. \u201cTell them Jos\u00e9 sent you.\u201d He offered a spotted, rumpled hand, and I took it. It was warm, rough.\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cI think maybe you will.\u201d He let go, and I let his hand slip away reluctantly. \u201cHe may not, though.\u201d He pointed his chin at Enrique. \u201cParents\u2026\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSomething to think about.\u201d\nI thought about it all the way home.\nI visited several times after that. I went to the outreach office on the Blemish, I talked to the team there, I read the propaganda. I brought Enrique, some of the time. Once, I even used their decrepit cosmetikit to wipe my mask, and sat unmade at an outside cafe for almost a quarter hour. Nothing happened. People came by, said hello, chatted about the weather, and went on their way. It was almost normal. After a while, I forgot to be self-conscious, and I got used to the marks, the bald spots, and, yes, the wrinkles. I couldn\u2019t deny that \u2018wrinkly\u2019 was an appropriate name, but it no longer called up horror or disgust. Instead, I thought of Jos\u00e9 and his fresh fruit juice, of the people who walked boldly and baldly through the streets of Wrinkletown just like regular people.\nIt came to a head one night, as I knew it had to. Probably I wanted it to. Certainly I was applying thinner and thinner masks at home in the evening, and going unmade during the day. One day, when I was finalizing some report structures for the desk to produce, Brendan came home early. He had take-out \u2013 a hot wedge of the Moldovan corn-cake I liked. I suppose it was a peace offering. He brought it into the study, calling out \u201cYour order of mamaliga, sir.\u201d\nI stood and turned, a big smile on my face. At last we were back on track.\nI\u2019d forgotten that I had no mask on. I don\u2019t know what Bren\u2019s face looked like beneath his. But it must have been bad; I could see a frown show through, and I heard him gag.\n\u201cBren!\u201d I cried, throwing my hands over my face. \u201cWait!\u201d But he was already putting down the mamaliga, already turning down the hall to the nursery. I stood in his path, hands at my side, as he carried our unmade son back toward me. \u201cBren, stop.\u201d He refused to look at me, just pushing past with a face as smooth as china. \u201cBren, we can talk about this.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d His voice was raw as he stood at the door, his back to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far, Jene. Think about Enrique.\u201d His voice broke, and I could see his arms trembling. Over his shoulder, our son made a happy face as he drooled on Brendan\u2019s coat. \u201cI can\u2019t take, it Jene. I can\u2019t \u2026 I can\u2019t come home to see a monster. To see you\u2019ve made a monster of my son. You\u2019re going somewhere, Jene. I \u2026 see that.\u201d His voice turned bitter. \u201cI can\u2019t help seeing it. But I can\u2019t join you, Jene. Wherever you\u2019re going, go alone.\u201d He opened the door, and was gone.\nI went looking for him, of course, the next day. I wore my Saja-designed mask and called our friends, visited his office. They wouldn\u2019t talk to me, wouldn\u2019t let me in. Eventually, I heard from Brendan\u2019s lawyer. We\u2019d never had a lawyer before. She looked nice; probably client interface mask #3.\n\u201cLet me put it to you plainly, Jene.\u201dI could hear sympathy mixed with distaste. \u201cThe marriage is through.\u201d I\u2019d figured that out already. I\u2019d done my crying, and I\u2019d come past begging. Especially since I knew what must be coming. \u201cAnd so are your parental rights. Either you return your appearance to community standards, or you won\u2019t see Enrique again.\u201d\nI closed my eyes. My mask was proof against tears, but I couldn\u2019t stand to see that smooth, friendly, false face, and know that mine was the same.\n\u201cYou mean, put up a false front,\u201d I managed at last. \u201cGive up my beliefs.\u201d\n\u201cCall it what you like. Those are the terms. Have your lawyer call me when you decide.\u201d She clicked off.\nI didn\u2019t have a lawyer, of course. No one would take me. As soon as they heard my problem, they waved me off. \u201cWe don\u2019t do\u2026 that,\u201d was the usual line, always delivered with calm, smiling, supportive face that showed nothing of what they felt and everything of who they were.\nSaja was still talking to me, at least. \u201cJust wear the masking,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d She was setting the latest trend \u2013 a shadow pattern that seemed hide her features in permanent shade.\n\u201cWhat difference? I don\u2019t know. The difference between truth and lies? Real and fake?\u201d\nThe shadows moved across her face, her expression mysterious. \u201cHappiness or no happiness? Are you happy, Jene?\u201d\nShe knew I wasn\u2019t. No husband, no child, and, it turned out, not many friends. I had my principles to keep me warm at night, my work to keep me company during the day. Even the work seemed to be drying up as word got out.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d I insisted, as if someone would care. \u201cEnrique is my son as much as his. Why should I have to lie to keep him?\u201d\nShe shrugged. We\u2019d already had all the arguments about truth and beauty. \u201cWe all lie about something. Mostly to others. Sometimes to ourselves. It\u2019s all a question of pride. Do you have too much to love your son?\u201d\nThat was the question that troubled my nights. Brendan was a lost cause. I knew that, even as it broke my heart. Enrique, though, still loved me. He was the only one who didn\u2019t care what I looked like. It would be silly to wear a mask in order to keep him. It would be wrong. But it would work, and the only person to pay would be me.\nTruth or justice. That\u2019s what a lot of decisions come down to. We like to believe it\u2019s easy, but we know it\u2019s not. It never is. In the end, I called the only people I thought might know more about it.\n\u201cI had the same,\u201d said Jos\u00e9, topping up my juice. \u201cI had two daughters. They live with their mother, now. On their birthdays, I used to make up, go and see them. Now\u2026\u201d With no mask to swallow them, the tears rolled wet and dark down his crumpled face. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, pulling framed photos from under the bar. \u201cThis is Linda. This one with the ribbons, that\u2019s Magi \u2013 Magdalena.\u201d\nThey were teens, made up in a style that had been popular some years back. I remembered the vivid jags of color, the oversized eyes. \u201cAnd now?\u201d\nHe shrugged, took the photos back in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t see them now. When they grew up, \u2026. It was embarrassing for them. I was.\u201d\n\u201cSo I should go back? Wear the mask?\u201d I couldn\u2019t let Enrique slip away, couldn\u2019t end up alone like Jos\u00e9.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He put the photos back under the bar, arranged them just right. \u201cThings have changed. Maybe it\u2019s different now. Maybe not.\u201d\nGive up my principles and keep access to my child? What would he think of that when he was older? What would I? Give up my child for the new self I\u2019d only just found? What would he think of me now? In a few years, would he think of me at all?\nSometimes, when none of the choices work, you just have to make your own. If no one\u2019s on your side, make new sides. With advice from Jos\u00e9 and a few others who\u2019d lost their kids, I chose to fight.\nSo that\u2019s my argument, Your Honor. Yes, I did those things. Yes, I moved to Wrinkletown. Yes, I go unmade. I\u2019m not ashamed of it. This mask I have on? That\u2019s not my face; it\u2019s something my sister made up for me. It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s a fake, a fraud, a little piece of cosmetic trickery to make people think I\u2019m perfect. I\u2019m not. But I\u2019m a good father. My son loves me. He doesn\u2019t care what I look like. I sound like Dad, I smell like Dad, I play like Dad. That\u2019s all he cares about. That\u2019s all that matters.\nB Morris Allen grew up in a house full of books that traveled the world.

A woman dropped dead that morning while taking a shower. Her son found her when he came home from school. He was a mess when I arrived. I was on duty so it fell to me to take the evidence photos of her dead body. I asked him if he wanted to be there while I did, explaining calmly and clearly that the coroner\u2019s office required them. He was a high school kid, an only child as I surmised from the mantelpiece pictures and trophies. His dad had been at work, rushed home when the boy called him. They hugged each other sobbing, as they shook their heads on the offer to remain in the bathroom and left me to my job. People trust me \u2018cause I\u2019m a woman. Except when they don\u2019t.\nI unloaded the photos right after that call and had to head out on another call. Inside my chest Bird\u2019s wings were flapping. As I took deep breaths, I realized actually that the fluttering has been more of a flapping for a while. I think it\u2019s just that Bird\u2019s been getting big. Growing like kids do. Really big from the painful banging of her wings against my ribs. I was so distracted that I killed a bird. A red-winged blackbird and his mate were chasing off a crow from their nest and flew right in front of my car. They flew so fast I thought they would all make it. The crow and the male red-winged did. The female red-winged, who is actually just brown, didn\u2019t. I know \u2018cause a tiny cloud of feathers swirled up in my rearview window. Another car was riding right up behind me so I couldn\u2019t slow down. I wondered who was going to raise their eggs now. The male? Every other time creatures have made it across the road or I\u2019ve slowed down in time. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do because there\u2019s always this bigger-than-you picture. You\u2019re just a teeny tiny part of it. Even \u201cyou\u201d is a big picture of which \u201cyour sorrow\u201d is just a fragment along with \u201cyour fear of getting hit by the car behind you,\u201d your \u201cjust a moment too late foot on the brake\u201d is another, and so on.\nSeven years ago when my five-month-old daughter lay dying in her hospital bed, the doctors and nurses and the religious guy thought I turned away because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. But it wasn\u2019t that. I was taking her with me and we were leaving the hospital. Bird and me, together forever. I had turned towards the door, brought my arm around, and swooped my fingers closed like I\u2019d seen a magician do. As I did, Bird flew into my hand, her little being all wings fluttering. Her heartbeat slowed, stopped. I glanced down as my fingers closed around a handful of iridescent feathers, and remembered how I knew I was pregnant. It wasn\u2019t morning sickness and vomiting like in the movies. No. A diner waitress poured me a ginger-ale, and I felt each bubble of fizz burst against my skin. A few moments or months after the ginger-ale, I watched Bird\u2019s heartbeat flash like a firefly on our ultrasounds. We were one. Even after she was born. Even though they said she was dying. That couldn\u2019t be. Because we were one. So, with her tubes and hospital bed behind us, I held Bird in my hand, brought my carefully closed fist up to my heart and cracked it against my chest. Her heartbeat slammed back into beating, faster and faster as she flutter-flew, real feathers, real wings now safe back inside me, and we left the hospital together.\nNow, when I reached my second call, I shot a quick glance at my front fender and saw a splash of blood and some feathers. I managed to quiet the painful flapping inside me and focused on the call. Wanda Duquette thought aliens were after her. She\u2019d shoved her refrigerator out on her front lawn. At some point, she\u2019d stripped, painted herself black, and started to get into the appliance, when she decided the aliens\u2019d find her if she didn\u2019t paint the fridge black, too. That\u2019s when the neighbors called.\nThey all stood around, filming her breakdown with their dumbphones. Wanda\u2019s sister-in-law was right out in front, leading the filming. Not one of them brought her a blanket. I thought about the chief as I got one of our standard greys out of the trunk and walked over to her, talking calmly. She flung it to the ground, shouting it was suffocating her with poison. Bird\u2019s wings were whacking me something fierce, so I slapped some black paint on the blanket. Wanda happily got under it. I took her inside her house, found her medication, called her doctor, got her situated with a home care nurse. I don\u2019t mind doing those calls\u2014people need looking after.\nBy the time I returned to the station, my partner Jos\u00e9 had already told the Chief that a woman under 50 just died naked in her shower. The Chief, true to form, had already gone pawing into the photos. Is dying naked in the shower a crime? Is being crazy a crime? Is being a woman a crime? Or does it just happen?\nIt didn\u2019t take much to lock the file; never does with someone who doesn\u2019t even think to close his mouth to breathe. You\u2019re thinking why don\u2019t I just report him? And my response is to whom? To protect and serve means we\u2019re all in this together. You don\u2019t want to be caught needing backup and no one comes when you call. I need to save my energy to do right by the people that I can do something for. I got to work with these guys. I am fast, good with jiu jitsu and I made it through the academy. They can count on me to do reports right and I am the one that people in the community trust. I can de-escalate pretty well. I don\u2019t get promoted, but that\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t need them expecting me to hang with them or go out to the Chief\u2019s lake house. With these guys, you\u2019ll never be side by side\u2014only underneath them\u2014and frankly I don\u2019t want it missionary or doggie-style or anything else with any of them. I got my own problems, I don\u2019t need theirs.\nI grew up in a foster home and got pregnant when I was 15. Bird was more beautiful than the world to me and for five months we flew through the sky together. I saw everything in the world through her, the ocean, land, space. I figured she was tired so we landed in the ER for a quick trip (I didn\u2019t have the healthcare plan I do now through the PD) after she went from babbling and smiling to frowning and winging and made a fist that she wouldn\u2019t release. I couldn\u2019t figure it out, couldn\u2019t figure it out. She disappeared inside herself, like when a soap bubble spins incredible colors, then suddenly turns grey, then black, and you know it\u2019s about to pop.\nBird had a stroke on one side of her brain. By the time I got someone to help me sort it out and get her help, she\u2019d had another stroke on the other side. The hospital put her on life support and I\u2019d lie down with her and watch her and sing to her and point to the sky which was just the shitty cracked white tiles in the ceiling, no blue sky and stars there. No more flying for us. She stayed in a medically induced coma, her eyes like slits. The machine breathed for her. About a month after her brain\u2019d popped, the doctor told me that if she stayed in a coma, very soon she faced a fatal heart attack. I sat up, listening to him tell me this, not wanting to lose it, to be a problem teenager, not wanting to burn the hospital down. I had my arms around her, cradling her head. I could feel her fluttering, wanting to fly away from here. I could hear the doctor a long way away, but I told her Fly to me, fly to me and I\u2019ll catch you and she did. She fluttered to me and they pulled me away. I trashed the hospital room, not because I was trying to be a problem teenager, but because I was trying not to crush Bird\u2019s wings but take them to a safe place to fly. She fluttered inside me after they turned off the machine that breathed for her, but that was ok because I had her safe in me again. I had all these bloggers and journalists wanting interviews with me and clips showing better days and then her with all the tubes in and out of her, and then a funeral and so I left. I\u2019m sure that people freaked that I was a shitty mother and typical teen, thinking only of myself. People get off on kid deaths; it really brings out their self-righteous hellfire.\nWhen I got out of the group home, and looked for jobs, I could feel her fluttering. When I saw the advertisement for police officers, I applied feeling those wings waving in me and I knew it was the right decision. I was a homeless cop between the academy and my first few paychecks, but I didn\u2019t care \u2018cause she was safe inside me again.\nWhen I had my job interview with the Chief and Sarg and a community representative (who was in fact Wanda\u2019s sister-in-law), they asked me specific questions about giving tickets. The first scenario was speeding\u2019s been a problem around the city limits, Sarg wants tickets written, my supervisor comes flying through on his off time. Do I give him a ticket? I said yes, of course, he issued the edict, I have to follow it and give him a ticket. Next question: my mom comes through going five miles over the speed limit. Do I give her a ticket? I said well, if she wasn\u2019t already dead, I wouldn\u2019t give her a ticket because that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t do to your mom. She\u2019s got enough to be punished for without a ticket. They thought that was funny.\nThe Chief called me in personally when they hired me. \u201cWe need someone to take care of the community, and apply for grants,\u201d he said.\nI understood that I was a woman (read: didn\u2019t have a penis), and so, excluded from what the male cops referred to as \u201cthe tripod club.\u201d Still, they needed someone to do women\u2019s work. Well, I was a woman and I was damned good at work. He knows I do fine with a weapon. But I won\u2019t use dogs because I don\u2019t want them getting injured by some fucked up human being. Also I knew how to write a sentence, what a paragraph was, how to spell and that means money.\nNow, my fuckstick Chief\u2019s screaming, \u201cEggman! We gotta job for you that means money for the dept.\u201d With the file locked so he could no longer get off on the dead mom\u2019s body, I faced him and saluted. He hates shit like that. He glared at me, rolled his eyes at my partner Jos\u00e9 and tossed a printout onto my laptop. Due date was in one week. The RFP was for $100K which was huge for a popo like ours. I banged out the best draft I could and sent it off.\nThe grant money was for a natural surveillance control unit. Staffed by raptors. You heard me right. Birds. I could feel Bird reading that one with me as my eyes skimmed the page. What about your rule about animals? I could feel her thinking furiously at me.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just birds,\u201d I said out loud, aware that the Chief had come into my office.\nBird missed my meaning and her wings jammed up into the back of my throat. I coughed.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting to be one of us, Eggman. May have to find a new name for you,\u201d he remarked and took the proposal.\nThe purpose of the grant was to incorporate a team of raptors into the PD who could take down the drones that everyone was buying to look at people and things that were just going to get them into trouble. Anyone can order a drone so everyone does. It\u2019s a free world.\nAnyways, the grant billed itself as a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem\u2014only the solution wasn\u2019t low tech. It was birds.\nPhase one had been with trained natural eagles. Phase two was for a group of bioenhanced eagles-whose brains had been nanoed while they were embryos. Scientists took microscopic cameras which would grow in the raptor\u2019s brain and injected them into the eagle egg. They used an ultrasound to guide the needle and put the micro-camera right into the bird embryo\u2019s brain. The camera grew there without interfering with the bird\u2019s eyesight. The camera was made of biomaterial, like part brain, part soul. They said it was like cams on drones. The camera was an eye. An objective eye. It simply saw things, which was supposed to make it easy to separate response from action, from inaction. Easy for the bird? Or easy for the camera?\nMy Bird didn\u2019t like me doing this at all. I didn\u2019t either. But it was my job and if anyone could take care of the bioenhanced raptors, it was me. Bird doesn\u2019t understand that you can\u2019t change the world. The grant was to get a team of four bioenhanced eagles to stop the drone invasion in the local neighborhoods.\nWe got the grant. Provisional to an observation period by the bird techs to see if we would care properly for their investment. I was going to manage the birds. The Chief, Jos\u00e9, and the others just sat around the Chief\u2019s office, smoking cigars and talking about what to do with the money.\nCity Hall had described our community as buzzing with drones 24\/7. The Chief believed the eagles could insinuate themselves into the community and not only take out drones, but keep an eye on the safety of the community\u2019s most vulnerable members. The bird techs wanted to see our PD, specifically our drone problem in action so they came out on a call with us.\nA drunk driver had crashed into the fire hydrant in front of the movie theatre. Water geysered into the air and fell like hail on the crushed car. A glow-in-the-dark beanie drone rushed me as I looked in the back seat (the bird techs tapped into my body cam from the safety of the patrol car as Jos\u00e9 called in the plate). I wacked away the drone as I saw a bottle, a stuffed zebra, and a sobbing toddler strapped in a car seat. Bird\u2019s wings bashed around inside me and I rebuked her, sharply for interrupting my work. First time ever. The little boy\u2019s eyes widened and he choked on a sob as he stared at me smacking myself. That reminded me the bird techs were watching. I pulled Bird and myself together, wondering how I could\u2019ve gotten angry at her.\nI smiled at the little boy, and he stared back, hiccupping, crying less frantically now. I unbuckled him, feeling carefully for any obvious physical trauma. He laid his little head on my shoulder. I breathed in his sweet baby smell. Bird poked me sharp in my lungs. Don\u2019t be jealous, Bird. He\u2019s not inside me where it\u2019s safe like you are. I eased him out of the car as Jos\u00e9 came over with the address of the owner of the abandoned car. As soon as the baby saw Jos\u00e9, he reached for him. Jos\u00e9 took him and his bottle and gave it to the boy who leaned on Jos\u00e9\u2019s shoulder. There was that damned beanie drone, recording the whole thing. I kept my cool because I had to track down the mother while Jos\u00e9 took the baby down to the station to wait for DHS. She\u2019d been home nearly two hours, locked in her bedroom when I got there. Trash, liquor bottles, moldy food everywhere. Another drone was buzzing from window to window\u2014this one shrieking obscenities at the woman who kept hurling things at it.\nThe bird techs said I was good with her, said I must be good with people. The funny thing is it\u2019s not like I LOVE people. I don\u2019t. But I know people need a lot. More than they will ever get in the one miserable lifetime they have no choice entering and no choice leaving.\nWe got four raptor chicks.\nThe bird techs wanted the chicks to know us intimately so that they would be dependable patrol and service creatures. They did the incubation and what Jos\u00e9 called \u201cthe Frankenstein\u2019s lab magic\u201d and gave us a brief training in how to raise them and then we were on our own, welcome to parenthood. None of the guys objected when I took the eaglets home. I made a nest for them. I felt the occasional flutter from Bird, but she was pretty quiet overall. I wanted her to get interested in the eaglets, too, so we listened to them peep, fed them, watered them, and together we watched livecams streaming raptor nests\u2014we saw a cat collar with a gold bell in one nest!\nI made a loft platform and moved my bed up onto it. In my bed, I made a nest and surrounded it with feathers\u2014including some from Bird who sulkily gave them over. Two of the chicks died. The bird techs said that was about the expected rate of mortality. The two remaining chicks burrowed in my hair, climbed onto my chest. I made raptor noises and mouthed the eaglets, fed them chunks of raw meat from my mouth. If they were going to have to work for people their whole lives, they should have whatever I could offer in the way of their world.\nThey grew up fast. There\u2019s a process called \u201cmanning\u201d the bird. All eagles have a nictitating membrane, an extra eyelid for cleaning and protecting the eyes. Eagle parents often pull the membranes over their eyes when feeding their young to keep the eaglets from accidentally damaging the parents\u2019 eyes as they lunge for food. My eyes got pretty fucked up at first. I also got a few chunks out of my chin. I watched the videos and moved like a raptor, croaking, squawking, shrieking at her. The Chief made cracks about how could a woman \u201cman\u201d a bird. Of course, he used the term \u201cvag.\u201d I had keep the birds up for 48 hours and adjust them to all kinds of human distraction and noise. I took them for long, high, far flying sessions since they need to fly, soar, dive\u2014the last which they can do at 100 miles per hour! I was the only one on our squad to make it through the handlers\u2019 class.\nI loved it. But I was not certain the birds were a match for the carbon propellers of the more sophisticated drones they would inevitably end up encountering. When the Chief and Sarg caught me squawking back and forth with the female one morning, they gave her badge number 143. I knew it was another jab, but that was okay \u2018cause Bird didn\u2019t like me calling the female raptor Bird anyway. 143 was totally serious about the job, and I\u2019m sure the pieces of meat and the numerous mice and rats I slipped in there didn\u2019t hurt.\nWhile outnumbered by the quantity of Amazon drones, we sure weren\u2019t outnumbered in the IQ of the populace who were buying them. It was always the same story: \u201cmy shopping drone lost track of my address\u201d (and ended up in my naked neighbor\u2019s bedroom) or \u201cI was just making sure my property was secure.\u201d In the back of my mind, what the Chief had said in the proposal kept nagging me, especially the part about the police force using natural expertise, natural perfection in seeing everything before it happened.\nPeople who dealt drugs and abused their families still wanted pets. So I had to make 143 and Jos\u00e9\u2019s male raptor whose name was 6 their pets by building a nest on a platform. 6 and 143 set up shop by nesting. Be their pets, I thought at them as I set up the streaming connection, remembering the little boy in the wrecked car, make everyone trust you.\nThe Chief came in as I was watching the bio-cam growing in real-time in 143\u2019s brain.\n\u201cWe got the drone thing down now,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d I waited, my eyes on 143\u2019s brain-cam. Bird filled my whole chest, motionless.\n\u201cWe watch them. While they watch the birds. Think of all the things we can find out. We might be able to stop things before they happen.\u201d\nI frowned. \u201cWatch who? And like what?\u201d I had never let anyone see me out with 143 so they didn\u2019t associate her with the PD. I was always invisible nearby though in case she needed me.\n\u201cEveryone we can and bad things of course! Those birds\u2019re our eye in the sky. And eyes in the sky are better than eyes in your head!\u201d\nJos\u00e9 came in with 6 at that moment, bringing him back to me to give the bird his raw meat lunch. 6 had decided he only liked to be fed by mouth and Jos\u00e9 couldn\u2019t bring himself to touch the raw meat, let alone feed him mouth to mouth. 143 never had that problem; she was independent and yet, responded even as the thought crossed my mind to hers. I fed him while they watched silently.\nNot long after, Jos\u00e9, who was very public with 6 especially after the video of him and the little baby boy had gone viral, took him out for drone patrol dressed in an avian-tailored police coat. Some bastard sent an upscale drone after him specifically, and its carbon fiber blades tore through one of 6\u2019s legs. Jos\u00e9 and the Chief got the bird techs to fix him, sent 6 back out, and his other leg got partially severed by another drone.\n143 was a stealth drone hunter and deactivator though. She not only took drones down, she could go pick them apart and deactivate them. On our off days, I had her watch me tinker with hardware, but 143 took it to the next level and showed me what to look for, how the cameras worked.\nMeanwhile, Bird\u2019s wings were still. No fluttering, no beating against my lungs, my heart. It was great to be able to take full breaths for a change. I worried at first because usually we were in constant communication, but I was learning so much from 143 and since Bird was safe inside me and getting bigger all the time, I was sure she was learning even more than I was.\nThe perch was in a high open area near enough to see into a few of the local neighborhoods. I staged my own cams to stream them so I would know exactly what they were up to and get there quick to save them if they got in trouble. Once the nest was operational, 6 finally started hunting his own food. Unfortunately, one of his first kills was a little pitmix puppy that some son of a bitch had abandoned. Boy, did we get blasted for that one. No one had caught on about 143 being an officer and with 6 wounded, people loved the idea of a service raptor settling down with a \u201cwild\u201d eagle.\n143 started flying over to a bungalow in the old beach area of the prescription drug district. The woman in the bungalow loved wildlife\u2014AND media\u2014as evidenced by her Facebook page and all her viral media. She had a little baby and dressed it in different outfits multiple times a day. That baby was always either made up like a Halloween decoration, or dressed up like some mini me political candidate. Her other obsession was posing with 143. Instagram had been replaced by NOW which offered photo after photo or all real time video, complete with changeable perspective, at whatever interval you set until you turned it off. 143 landed on her windowsill, had meals in her kitchen, became the subject of her photos, her \u201cpet\u201d just like I\u2019d ordered.\nI tried to get through to 143 about this hyper-focus distracting her from quantity and quota of surveillances she should be doing, but I got a lot of wing beating and shrieking in a tone that I hadn\u2019t encountered from her before. At the same time, Bird was crashing around inside me and making a falling feeling against my guts. I was out from work ghastly sick a few days.\nI had just pulled myself back together when I got a call from Jos\u00e9 giving me the heads-up that 143 had been found flapping all around in the baby\u2019s crib. And the baby was dead. The Chief said, \u201cMaybe the bitch had the Munchies\u2019 Syndrome.\u201d I didn\u2019t correct him except to review the records that nothing was out of order or untoward in her doctors\u2019 visits. There were no marks on the baby. Hysterical, the woman had called rescue. Hospital pronounced SIDS. The Chief ordered me to interview her, but she was too distraught to come in. Since she was an internet addict, I decided that I would interview her by video conference. After telling her that I would be recording information and how the Department would use screenshots, etc. we began.\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean for your baby to die, so why don\u2019t you tell me what happened after you put him down for a nap.\u201d\n\u201cI found that bird in my baby\u2019s crib, tearing up all my baby\u2019s toys so it could get to him and kill him and it did!\u201d\nOne of my hands made a motion like the magician\u2019s scoop, and Bird\u2019s wings hit the bottom of my throat. I coughed and burped, unable to quiet the storm in me. Trying not to choke, I could see the mother staring at me. I opened my mouth to speak and Bird\u2019s wings swept across the roof of my mouth. No, I can\u2019t let you die!\nOn top of sharp focus and a central magnifier, eagles have superior color vision\u2014an ability that evolved to help them detect the UV-reflecting urine trails of small prey. But we can\u2019t know what these extra colors look like, because, compared to them, we\u2019re blind. What could it mean to see all those colors we couldn\u2019t see? It meant 143 could see that a baby was going to die.\nI cut off the interview and rushed, still struggling to breathe, into the other room where the Chief and the bird techs had 143 pinned on the table. She was struggling, her gold eyes taking in all the colors we could see and all the colors we couldn\u2019t see. Her other eye, her brain camera, the eye that could separate action from inaction was being pulled out of her head by the bird techs with a needle and a remote. The Chief kept trying to grab the microscopic camera, yanking at the cords, pulling 143\u2019s head inside out. I shouted that the Chief was breaking the camera, but he thought you could pull it out like a chip, like a flash drive, like a single piece.\nThrough the speed of the rushing wings, 143\u2019s eye and the camera\u2019s eye spun around and around like the reverse camera icon on a dumbphone. I saw talons hauling away stuffed animals and blankets\u2014all the brilliant colors piled on top of the baby that made for a perfect picture. But 143 had seen the whole picture. She saw the baby was being smothered by too many hand-stitched blankets, too many windup toys, too many cameras, too many colors that we couldn\u2019t see\u2014like the colors of two strokes, of a heart attack, of a bubble about to burst\u2014so she\u2019d tried to save it.\nI scooped 143 into my arms and tried to crush her into my chest where she would be safe from this unnatural life\u2014where she and Bird could always live like the world was beautiful. But as I leaned into her dying face, my eyes wide open this time, two pairs of wings dove me down, down at 100 miles per hour to the floor. And I saw tiny fizz bubbles about to burst. As we hit, Bird and 143 exploded in a fireball of colors I never knew existed. I had to let go\u2014I had to release them. I couldn\u2019t save them from this savage world, but they had saved me. And when I let go, I soared up and away on their updraft before they disappeared like magic, like life, like death, into the ground.\nPhoebe Reeves-Murray has worked with children and teens for the last 30 years.

There was no one here to overhear her now, no need for silence.\n\u201cThe cleanup crew is inbound. Do you need extraction?\u201d\nBrittany clipped a thin black rope to her harness. \u201cI\u2019ll go out the same way I came in.\u201d A moment later, she was climbing up the outside of the steel and glass monolith. The air was sweet, even this high up\u2013the planet had been terraformed into a mountaineer\u2019s paradise.\n\u201cGood job tonight,\u201d her handler said.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your ETA?\u201d\n\u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I\u2019ve got a present for you.\u201d\nFifteen minutes later, Brittany accepted a box wrapped in simple blue paper. She opened it slowly, peeling the tape back carefully and unfolding the paper.\n\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d he said.\nA strange, blocky object rested inside the box. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cA camera.\u201d\nIt was heavier than she expected. After careful examination, she found a tiny window and looked through it. \u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\nHer handler pulled something off of the other end, and the world sprang into view. \u201cThis cap protects the glass lens.\u201d\nIt was like looking through a rifle scope. She pulled back and looked it over again. \u201cDoes it have an infrared or night vision setting?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a camera. Just for taking pictures.\u201d\n\u201cWhy give me this? Do you think I should retire?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI do. You\u2019re 21 now. You\u2019ve been at this for well over a decade and earned your retirement\u2013you should take it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do what? Become a photographer?\u201d\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want. Your stipend will cover nearly anything you can dream of. Your new identity is ready to go. Just say the word.\u201d\nBrittany didn\u2019t know how to live another way. The thought scared her more than scaling a 400 story building or dealing with a whole team of professional body guards \u2013 she knew how to do both of those things. They\u2019d never given her any training in a normal life.\nBut what would it be like to never have to kill again? Never see the light go out a target\u2019s eyes, never hear another last breath.\n\u201cIt would mean no more dawn workouts. You\u2019d be able to eat whatever you want, whenever you want. And sleep in every day.\u201d\nShe\u2019d always hated dawn workouts. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nBrittany chose the most non-descript outfit provided for her new identity and went out for dinner. She checked for exits and requested a booth in a dark corner, both purely out of habit. Without a specific target to watch, she found herself watching everyone.\nAll around her, people sat in groups. Chatting. Laughing. Taking pictures of each other with their meals, using normal phone cameras instead of the heavy antique that sat on her table with her sweating water glass.\n\u201cCan I take your order?\u201d The waitress looked frazzled and tired, with gray showing at the roots of her bright orange hair.\n\u201cDoes this place have a specialty?\u201d Brittany asked.\nThe waitress forced a smile. \u201cWe have the best grilled eel in the sector.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll try that. And a milkshake.\u201d She\u2019d always wanted to try a milkshake.\n\u201cWhat sort of milkshake?\u201d\nThey came in types? \u201cWhich is best?\u201d\nThe waitress\u2019s smile was real this time. \u201cChocolate.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d\nBrittany took careful pictures of her food when it arrived, then ate it slowly, paying attention to the texture and flavor of each bite, giving her meal the attention she usually reserved for targets.\nWhen she was done, she left the waitress a 200 percent tip and went back to her room to research the best food in the galaxy.\nShe read food magazines and made plans with a specialized travel agency. She travelled the galaxy and she ate. The hard lines of her life softened at the edges. She slept till sunlight streamed in through her windows, never set an alarm. Tiny noises still woke her, she still analyzed possible assets and threats in every room, but she abandoned the exercise routine that had been a daily habit for almost longer than she could remember.\nHer body was no longer a weapon. She delighted in her fat, in the fact that she\u2019d never have to scale the outside of a building in a harness again.\nIt was little things that made her retirement worthwhile.\nShe sent her handler envelopes full of photographs. He suggested books and magazines on lighting and composition. She only stayed in each city, on each planet, long enough to try their most iconic foods, then moved on.\nAt first, men tried to join her at her table, their eyes sharp and voices smooth, but eventually, as she added pound after pound of padding, they stopped.\nIt was a relief.\nShe emerged from an elevator to a magnificent view of a gas giant and its glittering rings. This colony perched on a moon in close orbit, and the restaurant\u2019s walls and ceiling were crystal clear. The building itself was so tall that it protruded the moon\u2019s thin atmosphere.\nIt was an architectural marvel. The hostess gave her a tiny smile. \u201cWill anyone be joining you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I have a reservation for a table for one.\u201d\nHer tiny table was right against the window, and she snapped a few pictures of the view before her waiter appeared. Touristy shots, but she liked them. \u201cI\u2019d like the chef\u2019s specialty, along with an appetizer and dessert. Whatever\u2019s best tonight.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish, miss. Would you like anything to drink?\u201d\n\u201cIce water. No lemon.\u201d\nThe appetizer was lovely, but bland. The main course was a local rodent, served whole with a heavy cream sauce and stuffed with truffles and something like chestnuts. Brittany rearranged the table four times before she thought she captured the grotesque twist of its face with just the right angle of shadow.\nThe dessert arrived with a tiny sugar rose perched on top of it, its petals fingernail-thin and tinted pale pink. She took pictures of it from every angle, trying to capture the crystal shimmer of the sugary surface.\nIt melted almost instantly on her tongue, and the sugar carried a faint floral hint.\nHer next few stops each also included a tiny sugar sculpture, each more lovely than the last.\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange how these have caught on so widely,\u201d she said to her latest waitress. \u201cEspecially since I haven\u2019t seen them mentioned in any of the food magazines.\u201d\nThe woman flushed and refused to meet Brittany\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh, well, they\u2019re just so\u2013 so pretty,\u201d she said, and all of Brittany\u2019s instincts kicked into high gear. There were no familiar faces in the dining room, but each sculpture had a similar look and care to its construction \u2013 it was certainly possible that each one had been crafted by the same artist.\nBut why? Why follow her around the galaxy feeding her random bits of beautiful sugar? Brittany leaned forward and placed a hand on the waitress\u2019s wrist. \u201cWho put the sculpture on my plate?\u201d\nThe waitress tried to pull away, but Brittany held her, keeping her fingers gentle, for now. \u201cCalm down. Don\u2019t make a scene. Just tell me what you know, and no one will hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know anything, I just got notes and the sugar flower, I never even met anyone.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know where to put it?\u201d\n\u201cThey said a woman would come in. A young, fat girl with a camera, and she\u2019d ask for the chef\u2019s specialty and order dessert. I was to just put the sugar flower on top of it.\u201d\nBrittany released her. \u201cWhen do you get paid?\u201d\n\u201cThey said the money would be waiting in my locker after you finished your dessert.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe waitress scurried away, and Brittany pulled out her phone. She\u2019d always had a team to research her targets, but she knew how to get into the hotel\u2019s security system. She pulled up the cameras just in time to see a man in a raincoat, his hood pulled low, slipping out of the kitchen.\nIt was simple to track him back out of the restaurant, into a waiting taxi, and then to a seedy hotel.\nMaybe too simple \u2013 it could be a trap.\nStill, she had to know what was going on. His hotel room was on the second floor \u2013 climbing in through the window would have been simple, once. Now it seemed like entirely too much work. She went to the room and knocked.\nThe man cracked the door. The instant she saw that it wasn\u2019t chained, Brittany shoved it back, hard, and the impact drove him into the room. He was alone, and the room was empty aside from a single battered backpack.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked, scrambling for his bag.\nBrittany kicked it away. \u201cMy name is Brittany. I\u2019m the woman you\u2019ve been following around with sugar sculptures. I want to know why.\u201d\nHe looked around the room, looking for a place to run. Brittany saw at least three points of easy egress, but he clearly didn\u2019t.\n\u201cDon\u2019t try anything stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cI assume you\u2019re the one who made the sculptures, and it would be a tragedy if I had to break your fingers.\u201d\nHe held her eyes for a moment, then sagged onto the bed. \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends. Answer my question.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just told to make sure you ate them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is in them? Are they poisoned?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I swear. I was given a different recipe for each one, but nothing in them is dangerous. I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d\n\u201cI want the recipes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2013 I didn\u2019t save them.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t save them.\u201d\n\u201cThey came on actual paper, and I threw them out.\u201d He grabbed the trash can, and Brittany tensed, ready to disarm him, but he pulled out a crumpled slip of paper. \u201cThis is for the latest one.\u201d\nBrittany took it. \u201cAfter this sculpture, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m done. I go home and get paid.\u201d\nBrittany rubbed her temples. She hated mysteries. \u201cWhen do you report in?\u201d\n\u201cWhen do I what?\u201d\n\u201cReport in. Tell whoever is paying you that you\u2019ve finished the job.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSo from here you just go home and trust that you\u2019ll get paid for your work.\u201d\nHe nodded.\nWhat sort of insane operation was she facing? Clearly, it was one without proper protocols. But it was also clear that this man didn\u2019t know anything else \u2013 whoever it was did a good job of insulating him from any useful intel.\nBrittany sighed. \u201cIf they do contact you, don\u2019t mention that we talked. If you do, I will find out, and I will kill you. Do you understand?\u201d\nHe nodded. Brittany noted his trembling fingers, clutched together in his lap.\n\u201cIf you stay silent, I will have no reason to hurt you. Are we clear?\u201d\nHe nodded.\n\u201cGood. Then we\u2019ll never meet again.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d\nBrittany paused in the doorway.\n\u201cYou really thought they were good? The sculptures?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThey were magnificent.\u201d\nBrittany debated changing the schedule that her travel agency had set, but the next planet purportedly had the best sushi in the galaxy, and the planetary security was the strictest around. She\u2019d had to apply for about twenty-five separate permits to get clearance to visit, and didn\u2019t want to miss it.\nAnd, she had to admit, she was curious.\nShe researched every ingredient on the list, and only found one that stood out. The recipe called for a tiny amount of a grated root that only grew on that world.\nShe pulled up any info should could find about the root. It wasn\u2019t much.\nShe tried to put it out of her mind on the interplanetary transport.\nShe didn\u2019t succeed.\nShe checked into her hotel and changed for dinner. A few moments after she sat down, a middle-aged man joined her at the table. Everything about him screamed money, from his hand-stitched suit to his artisanal, highly-illegal-unless-you\u2019re-rich real-leather shoes. He clearly took care of himself \u2013 he looked gym-fit \u2013 with manicured hands and carefully styled hair. \u201cI hate to see a lovely woman eating alone,\u201d he said with a smile.\nBrittany sipped her water. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d\n\u201cJust your company\u2013\u201d\n\u201cCut the bullshit. Are you behind the sugar sculptures?\u201d\nThe smile slid off of his face. \u201cPerhaps we should discuss this somewhere private.\u201d\n\u201cI came a long way to enjoy this meal. I can meet you after dinner.\u201d\nHis eyes narrowed \u2013 he clearly wasn\u2019t used to not getting his way. After a long moment, he slid a keycard across the table. \u201cI\u2019m in the penthouse at the Hilton. If you don\u2019t come, I\u2019ll see you for dinner tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve piqued my curiosity. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\nThe sushi was excellent, but Brittany hardly tasted it. She was almost tempted to skip dessert.\nBrittany slid the keycard into the door, and the lights flickered green. The sumptuous room was dark and smelled faintly of bleach.\nThat was never a good sign.\n\u201cYou sure know how to make a girl feel welcome,\u201d Brittany said, turning on the light.\nHer dinner guest stood in front of her. He was holding a gun in his right hand, but it was pointed at the floor. They were alone in the room\u2013no bodyguards. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to stand on the other side of the bed.\n\u201cLet me tell you how things are going to go down,\u201d he said.\nBrittany took the gun away from him, stepped back, and pointed it square at his head. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2013 what\u2013 \u201d\n\u201cTell me how things are going to go down. Didn\u2019t you have a speech prepped?\u201d\n\u201cYou clearly don\u2019t know who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cJust put the gun down, and we can talk.\u201d\n\u201cTalk, and I\u2019ll think about putting the gun down.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t crack under pressure \u2013 Brittany had to give him that. He sat down on the bed and managed to look almost relaxed. Brittany shot the cell phone that was resting on the nightstand. His silencer was top-of-the-line. This gun made a barely-audible hiss, and the phone shattered.\n\u201cTalk,\u201d she said, \u201cor you\u2019re next.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a drug. A miracle drug. And my daughter is dying. The drug isn\u2019t through testing, so I can\u2019t get my hands on it. I\u2019ve managed to find a man who can make it, but we can\u2019t get all of the necessary chemicals here. They\u2019re not legal to buy or sell, and are only found on certain worlds, in native plants.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where do I come in?\u201d\n\u201cYou were the perfect mule. Predictable and free to travel anywhere. I don\u2019t even have your security clearance. I bribed the travel agent to adjust your schedule, and I found a guy who made beautiful little sugar sculptures.\u201d\n\u201cSo you fed me and these chemicals and now you want to extract them?\u201d\n\u201cYes. There should be traces of them stored in your fat cells. Enough for my scientists to scan them and synthesize more.\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t at all what Brittany was expecting. It had nothing to do with her past. She was just a hapless victim.\nBut then again, she really wasn\u2019t. \u201cNo.\u201d She turned to leave.\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you. My daughter \u2013 she\u2019s just a little girl.\u201d\nBrittany remembered being a little girl. Before the surgery, before her work. She\u2019d been scared and in constant pain. It had been terrible.\n\u201cI will meet her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet your daughter, then decide if I will help her. I will not help you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to let you in the same room as my baby girl.\u201d\n\u201cIs she a baby or a girl?\u201d Brittany had no interest in babies.\n\u201cShe\u2019s seven.\u201d\nOnly two years younger than Brittany had been when she\u2019d completed her first mission. \u201cI will see her.\u201d\n\u201cYou stupid fat bitch\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt would be very easy for me to kill you,\u201d Brittany said. \u201cIt would be very easy for me to just walk out of this room, and all of your plotting and planning would be for nothing. Take me to the girl, or don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe girl was in a private hospital, surrounded by a maze of machines, beeping and whirring and hissing. It was a wonder the child could sleep. \u201cLeave us.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI want to talk to her. Alone. Then I can decide if I will help.\u201d\nHis face twisted into a snarl. \u201cThe instant you let me out of your sight, I\u2019ll be calling for help. You have to know that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you do doesn\u2019t concern me. Just get out.\u201d\nHe went.\nThe girl\u2019s face was thin and delicate, like a butterfly wing, dull beneath the florescent lights. Brittany reached out and touched her pale cheek.\nHer eyes fluttered open. \u201cAre you the angel of death?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI used to be. I\u2019m retired, now. Do you want to die?\u201d\nThe girl shrugged, nudging thin shoulders up against her thick pillow. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I want. My father wants me to live.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what your father wants.\u201d\n\u201cYou should! He has a gun. He always gets what he wants.\u201d\n\u201cI took his gun.\u201d Brittany held it out where the girl could see it. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d\n\u201cIf I said yes, how would you do it?\u201d\n\u201cI would smother you with your pillow. You are weak, it would be quick. And quiet.\u201d\nThe girl was silent for a long moment. \u201cAnd then the pain would be gone, right?\u201d\nBrittany shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens when you die.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for the offer,\u201d the girl said. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll live, if I can.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very brave of you.\u201d\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\nBrittany gave her a card. \u201cIf your father\u2019s drug doesn\u2019t help, they might be able to. But if you decide to call them, you must do it on your own. You cannot tell your father.\u201d\n\u201cWill they take me away from him?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe girl took the card. \u201cI hate him. I hate how he tries to control everything.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to kill him?\u201d Brittany asked.\n\u201cCould you?\u201d\nBrittany nodded.\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d snap his neck.\u201d\n\u201cHe is my father. And I do think he loves me. So, I don\u2019t want you to kill him. But thank you, again, for offering.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Brittany held out the gun. \u201cDo you want this?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She took it and held it between her skeletal fingers. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Brittany said.\n\u201cGood luck to you, too, retired angel of death.\u201d\nIn the hall, the girl\u2019s father paced back and forth, his face twisted with rage and fear. Brittany wondered how quickly his bodyguards would arrive.\n\u201cI will help her. What do you need?\u201d Brittany asked.\nHis tame doctor noticed some of the quirks in Brittany\u2019s physiology, and from the way the woman\u2019s face went white, Brittany guessed that she had at least some clue about what they meant. She trusted that meant that the doctor would be wise enough to not try anything stupid while she was in her care.\nShe sucked out twenty pounds of fat. Brittany was sad to see it go, but she trusted her body to supply more.\nWhen it was over, she went back to her hotel and called her handler.\n\u201cBrittany! I\u2019ve been getting your pictures. You\u2019re getting really good at food photography.\u201d\n\u201cI have a report,\u201d Brittany said.\n\u201cDo you need cleanup?\u201d he asked, his voice all business.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nAfter she told him what had happened, he was silent for a long moment. \u201cThank you for reporting this. We\u2019ll look into the father\u2019s illegal activities and monitor the girl.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe silence stretched.\n\u201cDo you really think they\u2019re good?\u201d Brittany asked.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe pictures. You like them?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re magnificent.\u201d\nJamie Lackey lives in Pittsburgh with her husband and their cat.

Pueyo\nA small logotype in their space suits said ESPACONO above two rows of sponsors and brands, just like anything ever made in Latin America. The Institute for Space Development in the Southern Cone could have had a better acronym, or included countries above the Tropic of Capricorn, but bureaucracy ruined all the attempts to fix the mistakes. The same symbol could be seen outside of the base, located at the core of planet SANTA MARIA-02.\n\u201cSuch formidable formations,\u201d said Professor Cervelim with pomp, gesturing at the dark land ahead. He observed the geological patterns through rimless glasses, patterns that looked very similar to crop circles in their particular artistry, at least as far as the aerial view was concerned. \u201cMakes one wonder what\u2019s the exact meaning of this\u2014what are they trying to convey with their symbols? A religious ritual, an attempt to communicate with the unknown? Maybe, only maybe, they were just like us\u2026\u201d\nThe girl by his side raised two straight eyebrows.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a road.\u201d\nThe planet\u2019s humid umber brown and juniper green shades were reflected in Professor Cervelim\u2019s beige face, lightening up his middle-aged complexion. Gabriela crossed arms and analyzed the long oval entrance, resembling a crack in the rock.\n\u201cA road, you say\u2026\u201d He repeated the words slowly, and the other four people\u2014two researchers, two security agents\u2014near the jeep-like vehicle looked at the highest authority in exoarchaeology of the team. \u201cAn interesting hypothesis, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s interesting or not, decide that later. We need to report to the base.\u201d Agent Gambazza, a truculent medium-sized woman carrying a small tablet with a five-centimeter protection layer, decided to intervene. \u201cNow, team, pay attention. The procedures are simple. Agent Solano and I will call each one of your names, and you\u2019ll give me your audio signature, which will make an official attestation saying you were aware of the risks before entering the cave. Then, you can go.\u201d\nProfessor Cervelim, Gabriela and Abel, an angular blond man who hadn\u2019t said a word until then, exchanged looks, faces covered by transparent headgears from the front to the back of their necks, whose crystal look allowed them to notice each other\u2019s uneasiness.\n\u201cThat\u2018s why I oppose Space Security as a field of study,\u201d said Professor Cervelim, shaking his salt and pepper head. Underneath the potent glass-like material of his helmet, his thick curly hair was tied to a low ponytail, smelling strongly of rue. \u201cIt\u2019s full of negativity. Very militaristic\u2026 I feel aggressive vibes coming from agent Gambazza and agent Solano. If this keeps going, it might interfere with my research\u2026\u201d\nAbel cleared his throat.\n\u201cEngineering for Space Security is a respectable field, as respectable as mine or yours.\u201d He was the youngest after Gabriela, and the only biologist of the team. His graphite space suit, like theirs, was solid and close-fitting, a model suitable for Santa Maria\u2019s atmosphere, allowing moderate mobility and good protection. In one arm, he had ESPACONO written in blue and green, and in the other, a blue and white flag with the Sun of May in the middle, the same as Agent Gambazza. \u201cCan I start?\u201d\nAgent Solano activated the tablet, talking in clear Spanish:\n\u201cSanta Maria-02. First human exploration mission, led by agents Macarena Gambazza and Amaru Solano.\u201d His voice sounded vaguely robotic through the transmitter of his suit, and the tricolor flag of Paraguay looked dark under the planet\u2019s natural dim light. The machine answered, repeating the entire Attestation of Awareness code, line by line, making it very clear that they were responsible for possible casualties, namely their own. \u201cPlease say your name, function and nationality.\u201d\n\u201cAbel Villegas, exobiologist, Argentina. I am aware.\u201d\nThe machine beeped, illuminating Agent Solano\u2019s dark amber face. Attestation saved. Then, he walked to Gabriela.\n\u201cUh\u2026 Gabriela dos Anjos, assistant exoarchaeologist, Brazil? I\u2019m aware.\u201d\nAttestation saved. Agent Solano stared at Professor Cervelim in apparent challenge. The other man either ignored him, or wasn\u2019t aware of his frowned forehead:\n\u201c\u00c1lvaro da Rocha Cervelim, chief researcher and PhD in exoarchaeology, Brazil. I am very much aware.\u201d\n\u201cAttestation sent.\u201d Agent Gambazza told the device, and one minute later, she received a confirmation from the only human in the base:\n\u201cRosario talking. You can go.\u201d\nAfter the device was back to the harness in her thigh, they activated the micro cameras and lanterns of their suits, and prepared to enter the cave.\nFrom above, Santa Maria looked like a sphere of carved wood, contoured by spirals of giant and complex embroidery, creating lozenges and twisted lines. Natural activity couldn\u2019t create precise patterns like the ones recorded by satellite, nor leave behind fragments of eroded machine.\nBesides the curious formations, gigantic caves populated the planet, sprouting from the ground like horizontal buildings, some of them as tunnels leading underground, others only as large, expecting mouths.\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d Abel whispered to Gabriela, pointing at the highest level of dried rock. In pictures taken by the first rovers, the grottoes were shaped like slugs, with rugose backs, amorphous bodies, and pointy, wrinkled protuberances like antennas. \u201cThe sonar detected water in the underground.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost too perfect to be accidental, right?\u201d Gabriela smiled at him too. The two had known each other since they were both graduate students in a three-month program on Extraterrestrial Civilization and Spacial Exploration in Montevideo.\nShe was from S\u00e3o Paulo and he was from C\u00f3rdoba, she studied Archaeology and he was a Biologist, and they were only a pair of years apart, so they clicked immediately and maintained contact from then on.\n\u201cYeah. The walls look like they were almost sculpted for something, or someone to come in. It\u2019s even warmer inside.\u201d\n\u201cCome, you two.\u201d Professor Cervelim talked in a very loud voice, pushing their backs for them to walk more quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to chat, we are making history.\u201d\nThey rolled eyes, used to this kind of interruption coming from her boss whenever they tried to engage in a conversation. The teacher, just like an overprotective parent, didn\u2019t like Abel, and made up all possible excuses to keep him and his assistant apart: Gabriela, can you take me to the doctor? Gabriela, I need you to participate in this workshop\u2026\n\u201cOoh, look at this!\u201d Professor Cervelim\u2019s tone was aloof, as if he wasn\u2019t quite there. Gabriela looked over his shoulders, at the dense goo dripping from stalactites. He used a small metallic vessel to store a few globs of it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dense moss. Maybe Mr. Villegas can give us a light?\u201d\nAbel\u2019s wheat blonde eyebrows furled, the same shade as his long hair. He had to pull it into a bun to fit the headgear, like Professor Cervelim with his ponytail, and Gabriela with her voluminous curls.\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d he answered, raising the vessel and squinting his light eyes. The viscous substance looked more like a body fluid than a plant, but the green color and the tiny leaf-like forms were easy to mistake. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOoh, this can\u2019t be anything but a door made by sentient beings,\u201d the teacher interrupted him again, in his usual monotone. The cave\u2019s entry was a wide hall to another smaller gape, about three meters long. \u201cLook at this framing, this vesica piscis shape\u2026 It\u2019s rudimentary, yes, a tad primordial\u2026\u201d\nGabriela stretched her neck to look inside. She touched the wall, feeling its warmth, and the wall moved like a switch, opening and closing slowly.\n\u201cStep aside!\u201d Agent Gambazza pushed her to the ground with a strong arm, checking the walls with all the devices she owned. Gabriela curled her full brown lips, her eyes hurting because of the flashlight above her helmet.\n\u201cWhat was that\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cSearching for any possible danger,\u201d Agent Solano anwered.\nGambazza didn\u2019t help her stand up again, only glared with revolt at her carelessness. The other woman\u2019s big droopy eyes were brown, and her pinky skin was painted with dark circles, heavy eyebrows, and a bulbous nose, close to a mole the size of a nail. After confirming the walls were safe, Gabriela leaned against them, her back getting more and more comfortable.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so rude,\u201d Gabriela whispered to Abel. She touched the wall again, and widened her eyes. \u201cAbel, check this out.\u201d\nNear the entrance, Agent Solano turned the tablet on again.\n\u201cRosario, can you hear me?\u201d\nA small pause, and then the current operator of the Santa Maria-02 Base, who was tracking their path through the cameras, answered:\n\u201cYep. Look, Solano, we don\u2019t have any result on motion or signs of life, but there\u2019s some interferences in the signal, so watch out.\u201d\nAbel spied on the agents with the corner of his eye, and then nodded.\n\u201cThe heat is incredible,\u201d he said, touching the wall as well. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect temperature, and\u2026\u201d\nBefore he could say anything else, Professor Cervelim interrupted Agent Solano, talking to the screen:\n\u201cRosario, my dear, the agents are overreacting. We\u2019re in front of a beautiful, primitive door, and now we\u2019re getting in. Please watch carefully from the base, you\u2019ll surely love the sight\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u00c1lvaro\u2026\u201d Rosario tried to argue, but Professor Cervelim disconnected the machine.\n\u201cThere, let\u2019s go. I can\u2019t wait the wonders waiting for us.\u201d\nThe gargantuan entrance led to a tighter corridor with pleated sides, whose soft, greenish brown rocks felt squishy to the touch.\n\u201cEven the ground is spongy,\u201d Gabriela stepped twice, and then jumped over the floor.\nAfter they were all in, Agent Solano touched the wall again, and the entrance closed. Macarena\u2019s suit started to beep.\n\u201cEh?\u201d She frowned her already wrinkled, large forehead. She pulled the tablet out again. \u201cRosario, I\u2019m getting signs saying the air is breathable. Check that out.\u201d\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Rosario grunted in return, and Gabriela could almost see that strange, lanky woman rolling her eyes back at the base. \u201cSeems so. That\u2019s weird. I\u2019ll send you the full data.\u201d\nAs quickly as the message had appeared in the screen, proving that yes, the cave was appropriate for human life, Professor Cervelim detached his helmet, and took a long, deep breath.\nGabriela ran to him, holding the transparent sphere that protected their heads:\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d she said in a high-pitched voice, looking agitated at everyone, asking for help with her round eyes. \u201cPlease put that back, I\u2026 We\u2019re not sure yet if this is safe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat a perfect, pure air,\u201d Cervelim answered, closing his folded eyes. \u201cTake yours off too, this is unlike anything seen on Earth. It will purify your lungs.\u201d\n\u201c\u00c1lvaro.\u201d Rosario pleaded with him as well. She had been friends with Cervelim since they attended college together, and she didn\u2019t sound very pleased at his behavior. \u201cListen to Gabri. Put that back.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, though.\u201d Agent Solano, to the surprise of the others, did the same and detached his helmet. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like being back home.\u201d\n\u201cAmaru!\u201d Agent Gambazza looked at the tablet several times, and then to the screen in her inner arm: BREATHABLE. \u201cAre you sure\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d Abel added to the chorus, but after the third check up, even Gambazza gave in.\nWith two clicks, she separated the helmet from the rest of the suit.\n\u201cTeam, you can take yours off too,\u201d Agent Gambazza ordered. The three were waiting only for Abel and Gabriela to keep going. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust us?\u201d\nProfessor Cervelim helped his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, disconnecting the headgear while she looked miserable with her small eyes fixed on the dark ground. Abel was the last one to do it, and it was true\u2014the air was fresher than the oxygen coming from the helmets, and they felt revitalized from inhaling and exhaling.\nThe team started walking again, descending the cave\u2019s passageway. Professor Cervelim touched the walls with gloved hands.\n\u201cI wonder what kind of malleable material they used to construct this. It\u2019s cushioned, it\u2019s warm, it recognizes the presence of living beings\u2026 You can even pinch it and\u2026\u201d He squeezed a bit of the wall, and they all tumbled over when the bottom moved, forcing them to the corners of the path.\nGabriela\u2019s first reaction was a low yelp, and agents Gambazza and Solano hopped like cats back to their feet.\n\u201cOoh, it reacts! This might as well be a covert for a more complex building. Perhaps\u2026! The walls have a recognition technology, and this heating system is very pleasing. It makes me want to take the rest of the suit off to see how it would behave.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t, professor,\u201d Gabriela begged, shaking the man by the arm. She was used to his delirious ideas and eccentricities, but this was out of the norm even for Professor Cervelim. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor now, I won\u2019t. But look at this\u2026!\u201d Professor Cervelim was back to his feet, and walked in front of all of them. The security agents didn\u2019t seem bothered anymore, and just observed the environment with curiosity, rather than skepticism.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice, indeed,\u201d Solano\u2019s monolids and wide nose were darkened by the change in the position of the lantern, now under his left arm.\n\u201cGabri,\u201d Abel pulled her arm to keep the girl close to him, watching them from afar. \u201cDo you\u2026?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Think they\u2019re all out of their minds? Yeah.\u201d Her eyebrows were down turned because of the stress, and she pulled the entirety of her long afro out, covering the round shoulders of the space suit. \u201cBut it\u2019s indeed really impressive.\u201d\nThe third door was even larger, and the corridor got progressively taller and taller, leading to what looked like a rudimentary ballroom. The roof was translucent, and allowed part of the light coming from the system\u2019s largest star to shine through the thin top in olive rays. They turned the lanterns off.\n\u201cEw,\u201d Gabriela squeaked, taking one foot out of the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s all wet.\u201d\nAbel knelt to collect the substance, very similar to the ones dripping from the stalactites in the beginning. This one covered a good part of the floor, separated in puddles.\n\u201cI wonder what kind of creature could have lived here.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d she shrugged, staring at the green goo. \u201cI find it interesting that this structure was at the end of every road, both from the satellite pictures, and the ones we saw in the spaceship. And the roads were definitely not natural. This environment could allow any beings like the ones we know to grow\u2026 Even a human.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about food?\u201d Abel touched another wall, feeling it flustering underneath the palm of his hand. \u201cWe\u2019d have to analyze the goo, maybe it\u2019s edible.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the goo!\u201d Professor Cervelim shouted from the other side of the hall. He was right by Agent Solano\u2019s side, and the man had sat on the floor, ripped part of the wall with the fingertips, and forced it into his own mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s the walls!\u201d\nGabriela\u2019s heart raced in the moment she saw Solano chewing the piece of wall like food, and she searched for Gambazza, expecting her to do something about that atrocious image. In the few minutes she had focused only on Abel, one agent was nowhere to be seen, the other was eating unknown elements, and her teacher was encouraging the whole freak show.\n\u201cAgent Solano!\u201d She ran to where they were, accompanied by an equally horrified Abel. \u201cPlease, stop doing this, it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d he said, confused by her expression. \u201cAnjos, you should try it too. Smell the walls, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\nGabriela\u2019s eyes were wide, almost looking big, and she got close to the wall. Indeed, it was fruity and sweet, and her stomach roared with the smell, asking her to eat, to pick at least one piece.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s okay for us to eat, sure.\u201d Abel\u2019s musical accent pulled her out of her small trance. He stared at Gabriela, frowning his bony forehead, intrigued by the emerald reflection in her dark black skin. \u201cBut not before taking the substance to analysis. This is basic, Agent Solano, you put not only yourself, but all of us, in danger. You should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Gabriela muttered, now feeling lighter. She was still hungry, but she had another thing to do: find Agent Gambazza.\n\u201cNow, where the hell is Macarena?\u201d Abel seemed to have read her mind, or shared her worries, most likely. The biologist looked around, and then at her, one more time: \u201cGabri, can you come with me?\u201d\n\u201cSure\u2026 But professor\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Gabi,\u201d said Professor Cervelim, gesticulating, his big nose twitching several times. In fact, it had been a while she hadn\u2019t seen such a happy expression in his bearded face. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better, no, I\u2019m superior now that I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve had an epiphany\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCool, but we need to find Maca\u2013\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNot even Mr. Villegas can ruin my mood now.\u201d Cervelim kept talking, and he knelt on the ground, changing then to the lotus position, legs crossed, and wrists leaning on his bony knees. \u201cGabi, I know what this is. This is a higher form of living. This is the perfect house, the supreme symbiont. A house that feeds you, oxygenates you. I don\u2019t doubt that it adapts to each kind of being. See\u2026\u201d\nUsually, his meditation position would mean \u00c1lvaro wouldn\u2019t talk or move for a while, eyes closed behind his glasses. Now, he moved slowly, first to the left, then to the right, and the ground moved with him, massaging his legs, and raising slowly. Abel looked disgusted when he realized that the meaty floor turned into a very simple bench.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need furniture\u2014the house turns into what you need! Now, I wonder if it has been, indeed, built by a species, or if it\u2019s Mother Nature\u2019s final opus\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m done here.\u201d Abel got tired of listening to him blabbing nonsense. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Gabri.\u201d\nGabriela stumbled as he guided her back to the door by the hand, where they could see the sticky stalactites and stalagmites bubbling with liquid, and the sugary smell filled the room like toxic gas.\nAbel was sweating under his light yellow hair, distressed and exhausted.\n\u201c\u00c1lvaro is right. This is too perfect. It\u2019s self-sustainable, accommodates visitors, it\u2019s edible, moves, breathes\u2026 And it\u2019s causing us all to be dizzy, strange, even Solano is being amiable\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd the walls have no signs of hand or paw prints, no painted drawings, no\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a house, Gabri, this is the behavior of a predator, and it\u2019s luring us all in.\u201d\n\u201cAbel\u2026\u201d From that distance, she could see his cheeks were red, and his breathing was irregular. \u201cI\u2019m dizzy too, but we need to find Agent Gambazza, and talk to Rosario. She\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d Abel was firm, and she held his hand even tighter, realizing how slow he, too, was being. Gabriela looked everywhere through the now tremulous green lighting: Agent Solano stuffed his mouth with more chunks of wall-flesh, Professor Cervelim muttered a long \u201cmmmmmmm\u201d during his meditation, and Agent Gambazza\u2026\n\u201cShe\u2019s there!\u201d\nMacarena was standing in front of a wall, still. When they called her name, she sat on the floor, very slowly, in a chair-like shape like the one they had seen under Professor Cervelim.\nSitting wasn\u2019t enough, it seemed, and she looked very relaxed: shoulders down, shaky eyelids, mouth slightly open. She placed her open palms on the floor, rubbing the layer, forcing it down.\n\u201cMacarena\u2026?\u201d Abel called again. She looked at him, ignoring she had been called by her given name, and laid there, face down. \u201cAgent Gambazza, what the hell are you doing?\u201d\nOnly her thin dark hair was visible, draining over her body like weak black snakes. She breathed in and out, filling her lungs with candy air.\n\u201cAgent Gambazza.\u201d Gabriela decided to intervene, her curls covering her sweaty forehead. The other woman didn\u2019t move one centimeter. \u201cPlease, get up\u2026 We need to go, we\u2019re al in danger\u2026\u201d\nA grainy, distorted noise distracted them, coming from Macarena\u2019s lower body.\n\u201cLAND TEAM\u2026 LAND TEAM\u2026OU LISTENI\u2026 LISTENING?\u201d\nRosario\u2019s voice was repetitive and dusty, like an old radio. Abel didn\u2019t have any more doubts: he jumped over Agent Gambazza\u2019s petrified body, and detached the tablet from her thigh harness. Gabriela turned the device on while he tried to pull the agent up, but her limbs seemed glued to the floor, and they were melting.\n\u201cRosario, we\u2019re listening, we\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLAND TEAM\u2026 OUT\u2026 ET OUT\u2026 LAND TEAM\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh my god..\u201d Gabriela looked to see what Abel was staring at, but the gooey substance had adhered to Macarena\u2019s light olive skin, and even her hair was being teared apart. Whenever the man tried to release her, her skin started to crumble, ripping superficial pieces out and creating fresh wounds.\n\u201cOUT\u2026 NEED TO GET OUT\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRosario, please, listen,\u201d Gabriela yelled, squeezing the tablet close to her mouth. Her hands were wet with sweat, and she searched for the other two once more.\nThe gurgling viscosity dripped over Professor Cervelim, who talked alone, thanking the walls and stalactites, and Agent Solano\u2019s stomach was distended, still being filled by wall.\n\u201cGabri, we need to go!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 OUT\u2026 ALIVE\u2026 LAND TEAM\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave them, Abel, the thing is\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cGo, GO!\u201d He grasped her by the arm, trying to run to the entrance, but the muck was slowing them down. The puddles now covered the entire floor.\n\u201cIT\u2019S ALIVE\u2026 TEAM\u2026 LAND\u2026 ANSWER\u2026 LUG!\u201d\nAbel\u2019s right foot got stuck in a cavity, and he stopped abruptly. \u201cGo, Gabri, you need to go!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Gabriela\u2019s vision was cloudy with fat tears, and she bent down to drown her hand in the greenish sludge. Even with the protection glove, she could feel it burning through the fabric, and her skin melting, like it happened to Gambazza. She clasped his heel. \u201cKick! Kick!\u201d\n\u201cUgh!\u201d Abel held her up, pulling her over one of his shoulder, to avoid her being pulled by the liquid too. Gabriela hugged his neck, feeling trapped in a quicksand, until it let her hand go. \u201cGo, run, we can do it!\u201d\n\u201cTEAM\u2026\u201d Rosario\u2019s voice was clearer as they got close to the entrance leading to the corridor. \u201cLAND TEAM. YOU NEED TO LEAVE. ARE YOU LISTENING?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, we\u2019re listening!\u201d Gabriela screamed, shaking the tablet. \u201cHelp, we need\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLAND TEAM, YOU NEED TO LEAVE. IT\u2019S NOT A CAVE, IT\u2019S A GIANT SLUG. IT\u2019S ALIVE, I REPEAT, IT\u2019S ALIVE.\u201d\nThe fleshy gape opened and closed like a throat, and they were pushing the slime away, hoping it wouldn\u2019t melt the bodysuit.\n\u201cRosario, please, help, base\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYOU NEED TO LEAVE. LAND TEAM\u2026 ARE YOU LISTENING? YOU\u2019RE BEING EAT\u2014\u201d\nThe tablet fell on the goo.\nH.

On the door jamb, at every birthday, and every generation the wood would be removed to the shed to be nailed up along the wall and there they were, all of them, all of their large and extended family for the better part of three hundred years.\nAll of them but Eli.\nThere was no standing for him. He\u2019d been born with useless legs, the bones all twisted and his femurs would go to the grave with him. He\u2019d never stand, let alone walk, and when he died, it\u2019d be the Carnival for him.\nHe couldn\u2019t deny there was pleasure in that knowledge, pleasure even in the bitterness of it. For all the flaws of his birth he was still an ocean child, born in a country of islands, in a glorious regeneration. \u201cIt\u2019s an honourable thing, Carnival,\u201d he heard and he knew that all who said it believed it. Every full moon his family would go out, dressed in their best to eat taro cakes and wait on the wharfs for watching. There\u2019d be music and fireworks and the welcoming scents of fried fritters and warm cider, and finally there\u2019d be the giant floats to take the bodies of the dead out to sea, to feed them to the fishes for ocean restoration, the ecosystem damage once nearly irreparable but ameliorating, now.\n\u201cI want mine in the shape of a marlin,\u201d he\u2019d said once, of the float that would one day mark his place in the funerary procession. Something sleek and strong that could move swiftly through the water. Eli was a good enough swimmer \u2013 his arms were strong even if his legs were not, and that made a difference in stroking \u2013 but the swimming was always marred by the way he\u2019d have to beach himself at the end. The way he\u2019d have to haul himself up into his chair, each time hoping that he\u2019d not need someone to help him.\nIt wasn\u2019t the wheelchair that bothered him. He could live with that and be grateful for it, could live with the foreknowledge of Carnival even, but what echoed in the thin bones of his chest was the certainty of his isolation, of the broken lineage of bones.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be nothing of me to pass on, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave no notes behind me.\u201d\nWorst, he was the only child. The disappointment, the gap in the record.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a disappointment,\u201d Marcus said to him. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think that.\u201d But all Eli could think was that he had cousins, strong, tall men and women with beautiful bones, bones fit for calling whales. It was easy to overlook his own deficiencies when there was family to take his place.\nThey would take his place, too. The substitution would be total. It wouldn\u2019t be done with pleasure \u2013 Eli knew that he was loved \u2013 but there were duties to more than him, to more than son and cousin and nephew. \u201cIf we don\u2019t sing to them, who will?\u201d\nHis bones were too twisted for song.\nHe\u2019d refused to learn to play, at first. The long tedious hours of practice, the ever-present scales, were bad enough without the embarrassing realisation that his feet would never reach the pedals.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, meaning won\u2019t.\n\u201cOf course you can,\u201d said his father. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your hands.\u201d Large, nimble, the fingers limber and strangely slender. \u201cYou\u2019ve got artist\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the point of that,\u201d said Eli. His death would be an unmusical thing, leaden and reserved for fish instead of whales. None of his bones would join the instrument of his ancestors, the femurs of generations past hollowed out and banded to the rest, the entire bony bulk of them forming an enormous organ, something submerged, to be played in the ocean, a fascination for whales, a sign of friendship.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still a member of this family,\u201d said Marcus. \u201cAnd you will learn to play. Bone length, wavelength. It is our calling. You mightn\u2019t be able to help with the first, but the notes come from long practice as well as long bones. I won\u2019t have you make yourself incapable.\u201d\nBut obligation wasn\u2019t inspiration, and it was insufficient. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d Eli said again, later. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be anything of mine in it.\u201d None of his bones, none of his body. \u201cIt\u2019s different for you.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said Marcus. \u201cMy bones aren\u2019t in it yet either. I\u2019d like you to play them when they are. And your children, one day.\u201d\n\u201cAnd their children, and theirs. I know,\u201d said Eli, but his father wasn\u2019t finished.\n\u201cMaybe not. Our family\u2019s made that organ for generations, but it changes. Nothing lasts forever.\u201d\nBones were not immortal. Even submerged, they wouldn\u2019t last forever. Perhaps once they would have had a longer time beneath the waves but the warming ocean had effects on more than coral, on more than the deadened and bleaching reefs of neighbouring Australia. \u201cBones come in, bones go out,\u201d said Marcus, and he made Eli swim out with him to the organ.\n\u201cTake a closer look when you\u2019re down there,\u201d he said, and Eli closed his mouth over the snorkel, swilled his mask with sea water. The organ swelled below him, white beneath the waves and rounded. There were dozens of bones, hundreds of them, bones from cousins and second cousins and third, from grandparents many times removed. Bones brought into the family from marriage pacts, those brought from births. If he were to dive down further, beyond the shallow reach of pipe to the seabed beneath he\u2019d see the remainder scattered around, skull and scapula and the smooth scattering of carpus, and around them all the thin remains of nets.\nHe\u2019d rarely been down to the organ; had never wanted the reminder. The bones were all bound up in straight lines and they\u2019d never done anything but make him feel twisted. Yet Eli had been told to look closely, and Marcus had never been a man who spoke lightly so he swam closer, less awkward in the water than on land and when he swam, it was with one hand on the bones, one paddling through water.\nThe bones were smooth under his fingers, porous, though some of them were slicker than others. Eli assumed it was the action of waves, smoothing down the surfaces, scouring them with sand. He\u2019d seen pieces of glass on the beach, their edges rounded and the glass opaque, polished to roundness and a shape that was easy on his fingers, absent of edges.\nHe kicked as best he could with his twisted legs, pulled himself along the bone, only briefly rising for breaths. He tried to follow the pipes along the lines of aging, the bone becoming thinner, more fragile beneath his hands until he grasped one tight and felt it give against his palm. Only a little, and his reactions were quick enough that he could loose his grip without cracking it, without destroying the length of pipe, but Eli could see that it wouldn\u2019t be long before it cracked along its length. When he looked as closely as he could, as close as his mask would allow, he could see little spider cracks, places of fineness. The bone was disintegrating, and when it went the tone would be different, the organ altered in its sound.\nIt was a family practice to engrave the name of the former owner. There was an uncle who was particularly good at this, who could etch with a thin, delicate hand a band near the top of a bone, but he was too young to have marked this one, and the place where the name had been had worn away.\n\u201cWho is it, do you know?\u201d he said upon surfacing, when Marcus had hauled him from the water and set him on the platform to dry.\nHis father only shrugged. \u201cI think it was an aunt. One of mine, a great great. I never met her, of course, but by all accounts she was a skinny thing. Fine-boned.\u201d\n\u201cThere are older bones down there that aren\u2019t so bad,\u201d Eli said.\n\u201cMaybe she had the beginnings of osteoporosis. It makes the bones brittle. Happens more often in women, you know. Keep that in mind, if you marry, if you have daughters. Calcium supplements. They\u2019re easier than dairy.\u201d Eli\u2019s mother hated milk.\n\u201cIt happens to all of them, in the end,\u201d said Marcus. \u201cAll the bones. They\u2019re only temporary. Even if yours were suitable, they\u2019d still go eventually.\u201d\nBut they weren\u2019t suitable, and he found little comfort in his father\u2019s words. Eli kept up with his musical exercises, out of respect if nothing else. There was no joy in it.\nEach of the notes sounded like the erosion of bones.\nThey were all buried in parts, his family. There was no Carnival interment for them, no return to the sea, bound about with fish frames and sinking to the ocean floor. Their memorial didn\u2019t come with art and mimicry, it came with cauldrons and calling: the smell of boiling meat, the scooping off of fat. They\u2019d hack the meat off bones, most of it \u2013 or as much as they could bear to take, and that would go to the ocean. It was the closest they came to Carnival, the wrapping of flesh in biodegradable netting and weighting it down to the sea floor to be eaten by crabs, by bottom crawlers and octopi.\nHe remembered being afraid. He\u2019d been eight, a small eight, and his grandmother was dead. He\u2019d been taken in to say goodbye, to kiss the cooling cheek while it was still as warm as sea water. His grandfather had the sheet pushed up and was measuring his wife\u2019s leg. The tape shook in his hands, and Eli had shaken himself, had bent over the metal arm of his chair to curl himself into his mother\u2019s body until he was taken away to a warm bright kitchen where he was given milk and pink wafer biscuits.\n\u201cAre we going to chop her up, Mum?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes it have to be us?\u201d Am I going to have to do this to you, one day?\n\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d Maria said. Her hands were covered in coconut and icing, making lamingtons for the wake. \u201cHave you been worried about that?\u201d\nEli was. The bones had to come out, had to be sloughed of flesh but how much would he have to look? How much would he have to see? They\u2019d cover her face first, surely.\nHe\u2019d hoped so much to be straight, to be big. To be normal. Now he thought he wouldn\u2019t mind being small and twisted if he got to miss out.\n\u201cWe only need the leg bones,\u201d she said. \u201cThe femurs. You know that. We\u2019ll get a doctor to take her legs at the hip, to remove everything below the knee. That\u2019s all we\u2019ll get, the thighs. You won\u2019t even know they belonged to her at all, to look at them.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t Grandpa know?\u201d Eli said. They\u2019d been married for over fifty years. He probably knew every little bit of Granny\u2019s skinny chicken legs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he won\u2019t have the making of them.\u201d She gave him another pink wafer. Eli thought she might be feeling sorry for him, so he did his best to make his lip quiver an extra bit, and got the rest of the packet for his trouble.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they take the rest of her to Carnival?\u201d he said. To be floated out with light and music, to be offered up to the ocean fishes.\n\u201cYou know why,\u201d said Maria. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, Carnival. But we are for the whales, and our remains go to them. What doesn\u2019t go to the organ lies in peace beneath it.\u201d\n\u201cBone length, wavelength,\u201d Eli repeated, below his breath as an exercise for control. Mouthing the words distracted him from the desire to vomit. \u201cBone length, wavelength.\u201d\nMaria had left only one bone for boiling. The other was unsuitable \u2013 she\u2019d fallen as a young girl, broken her left thigh in two places. \u201cShattered it, really,\u201d she used to say. \u201cI was in a cast for months.\u201d Eli remembered that she used to rub the leg with manuka wax infused with arnica, with lavender oil and rosemary. As a boy he\u2019d offered to do it for her but Maria had smiled and refused. \u201cThat\u2019s your father\u2019s job,\u201d she\u2019d said, and he was grateful for that now. Grateful that in the decades since his birth her body had become unfamiliar to him, a half-remembered thing.\nIt meant that what he\u2019d been handed, the one piece of his mother not meant for the nets, could have come from anyone. It was heavier than he expected, the skin papery, a little loose with age. When he uncovered it, the flesh and joint and stink of it, he didn\u2019t recognise it as hers.\nHe still knew that it was.\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d said his cousin. Hannah\u2019s hand on his shoulder was comforting. She\u2019d been the first one he called, when it happened. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d\nBone length, wavelength.\n\u201cI want to help,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou are helping,\u201d said Hannah.\n\u201cNot in any way that matters,\u201d he said. He\u2019d arranged the funeral, the nets and the flowers and the food, but these were superficial things. They weren\u2019t what mattered, not to his family, and not to his mother.\nBone length, wavelength.\n\u201cYou can do the boiling with me,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it together.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay for the cutting too,\u201d said Eli. He made it through her sharpening the knife, the long thin blade there to slice off the flesh before the cauldron, but when Hannah balanced his mother\u2019s thigh on one bloody end and began to carve down the length of bone, he had to leave. Outside, he sat in his chair with dizzy vision and bent over, trying to settle his breathing, to settle his gorge.\nIt was easier when he put his hands over his ears. Hannah was silent at her work, but the imagining of small noises was too much. When she came out, the skin and muscle was in a large bowl, covered over neatly with a tea towel, ready for discarding. \u201cYou can take it to the nets, if you like,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile I heat up the water.\u201d Her hands were scrubbed clean, the nails pale and without any crescents of blood.\nMaria\u2019s body was wrapped in woven flax, the leaves fresh cut and not terribly pliant. Eli couldn\u2019t even see the gap where one leg had been, the space between hip and knee, but when he handed his uncle the bowl he could see that a flap had been made, a little pocket in the empty space between the flax, and that was where the bowl\u2019s contents went.\nHe looked away when they put them inside. The net was wrapped around them, woven with flowers. There were stones tied to the edges for anchoring.\nThey gathered in boats to give the body to the whales. It was always something of a relief \u2013 it took time to transform bones to pipes, and the body couldn\u2019t be contaminated with any preservative, not if it were entering the ecosystem. It was four days after her death when Maria\u2019s family were able to fix her femur into place, make a place for it in instrument.\nIt was four days before her uncle could sit before the keyboard, set in place on the platform floating above the pipes, the keys connected to them, the bellows between. He played and played and from his boat Eli listened, tried to distinguish the new sound from the old, the difference made by death. Underwater microphones transmitted the sound to surface, but it had been three years since his father\u2019s death.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell the difference,\u201d he said to Hannah, over the watery strains of concerto. \u201cI haven\u2019t been out here enough.\u201d He took his turn playing for the whales, they all did, but no-one said he had to listen as he played and there was wax in his ears, often, and the merest tremor of reverberation in his bones. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let duty become a pleasure,\u201d he said.\nThey stayed on the water while the surface cooled, listening. When the reply came, a deep rumble picked up through the microphone and travelling fast, the song of the whales returning, Maria was placed with her weights in the water and left to sink to the ocean bottom. Some flowers came loose as she sank, returned buoyant to the surface.\nThe family always listened for whales at funerals but it was only rarely that they saw them. \u201cBone length, wavelength,\u201d Maria had told him. \u201cThat\u2019s our family words. It doesn\u2019t say anything about reward.\u201d It was a lucky thing, to see them. Yet when Eli saw the shapes in the water, his hands still imprinted with the pattern of funeral nets, he could tell that they weren\u2019t the whales who had sung in response to burial song. They were toothed whales, not baleen, their bodies smaller and more compact, full of contrast.\n\u201cCarnivores,\u201d said Hannah, clutching his hand in hers as the orca dived beneath the surface. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. Do you think they\u2019re an omen?\u201d\nTheir song could be heard above the water, a thin high-pitched whistle that femurs could not replicate, not even generations of them bound together. On the platform, his uncle had stopped playing, was watching with the rest, wide-eyed, grateful.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Eli.\nThey\u2019d been a long time returning, the orca. He\u2019d not seen them before in his lifetime. Perhaps the long years of ocean recovery had paid off: the careful management, the fertilisation of Carnival, the welcome songs. Perhaps there was a place for them now.\nHe felt their whistle in his bones.\nHannah died at sea, on a fishing boat. She fell from the rigging, fell into the water and it would probably have been alright if she\u2019d entered the water conscious, but she hit her head on the way down and drowned before her shipmates could get to her.\nThey brought her body back at season\u2019s end, packed gently in salt so it didn\u2019t putrefy. \u201cIf it had been anyone else, we would have given her to the sea,\u201d they said. \u201cBut we know your ways.\u201d\nEli had gone to her parents, to her brothers and sisters. \u201cI can do it,\u201d he said. His aunt\u2019s eyes were red with crying. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d\nHer family \u2013 their family \u2013 was grateful. It made it easier to ask. \u201cI wonder if you would let me take her hands as well,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the cauldron.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re too small for the organ\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Eli. \u201cBut I think they might be used for the whales regardless. I don\u2019t ask lightly. I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou and Hannah were always close,\u201d said his aunt. \u201cShe called you her favourite brother, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Eli, though he did his best to forget when Hannah\u2019s legs and Hannah\u2019s hands were delivered to him. The hands he put straight in the cauldron, without looking for they were familiar to him: the long fingers, the calluses from ropes and sails. The thighs could have come from anyone \u2013 Eli had trained himself not to stare at other people\u2019s legs, and his family\u2019s most of all, for there was bitterness in the sight.\n\u201cBone length, wavelength,\u201d said his aunt, his uncle, when they\u2019d given him permission for their daughter\u2019s bones. He said it to himself when carving the flesh from those bones, when putting them into the pot. He\u2019d had it set low, a small ramp built beside for his chair so he could sit above and scoop off the last scraps of boiled flesh, of fat and grease.\nIt was a hot job, closed in. Eli smeared lavender oil beneath his nostrils, closed his eyes and breathed slowly, tried to impose order on his reactions, to not let his heart beat in time with bubbles.\nThe bones boiled in salt water, ocean water collected by Hannah\u2019s brothers and that made it easier, as if she were there with him almost. When the boiling was over there were smooth clean lengths in the cauldron. The little finger bones, dislocated from each other, from the tendons and flesh that held the phalanges together, were small and finer than he thought.\nHe hollowed her femurs first: set them tight in a clamp, worked slowly with the drill and saw, sang as he worked. Fishing songs that she would have sung out on the boats. \u201cIt should have been you going to Carnival, not me,\u201d he said, and smiled to think how she would have responded.\nI might spend my days fishing, cousin, but there\u2019s still whale song in my bones.\nIn yours too, I think, she would have added, though quietly. Always under her breath, so he had the excuse not to hear her, not to call her liar.\n\u201cYou speak well,\u201d she\u2019d said to him, at his mother\u2019s funeral, at the ending of eulogy. That was not a lie. Eli did speak well. It wasn\u2019t that he said anything special, or that he told people what they wanted to hear. But so many years of musical education had left their mark: he spoke in rhythms, in tonal shifts. The syllables fit together with measurable beats, with alliteration, with assonance. What he said sounded pleasing.\nA shame he couldn\u2019t translate it into rhythms of a different sort. \u201cYou could try composition,\u201d Marcus had suggested to him once, but he didn\u2019t have the knack. No, that was untruthful \u2013 he didn\u2019t want the knack. There seemed little point, to write songs for instruments he\u2019d never be part of.\n\u201cAh, you should try it,\u201d another cousin had told him. At least, Eli thought he was a cousin \u2013 three times removed, or married to one. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like hearing them sing, knowing that they\u2019re singing back.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter that they couldn\u2019t understand each other; that the whales and the bone organ spoke in different notes, rippled differently through the water. The whales still came, fascinated by Bach and Brahms and the great echoing tones of newer compositions, of songs with the tones of Southern Cross and Pacific Ocean instead of stone churches and sacrifice. At least, some of them did.\n\u201cI always thought the songs were not for me,\u201d Eli said, he who spoke so well and had resigned himself to failure with whales. Bone length, wavelength, and him on the outside. But there were whales they hadn\u2019t called, that hadn\u2019t yet been coaxed near to shore, that hadn\u2019t returned for celebration and the restoration of ecosystem. The fish eaters, the flesh eaters, for the seas had been over-fished and the sharing hard to learn.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something I can play after all,\u201d he said. Hannah\u2019s finger bones were small, so small, and they had been hard to turn into pipes of a different sort, into tiny flutes even when he\u2019d managed to solder the lengths together. There\u2019d be no deep notes, no bass rumblings to surge beneath the waves. All that came from the fingers\u2013 from his fingers as they stopped the holes in hers and his breath over both of them, was whistling.\nHe couldn\u2019t play it underwater. This wasn\u2019t an organ instrument, to tether beneath the ocean surface, to press notes and pedal from a floating platform above. This was something that had to be piped again, the high haunting notes transmitted through speakers, and for many hours there was no answer.\nEli\u2019s hands ached, his beautiful hands, his fingers nimble and straight as his legs weren\u2019t. The fingers he could pass on, if only they were capable of producing music to call the whales, to fascinate them with sounds like their own, and yet unlike.\nWhen the slick, smooth black and white bodies of the orca broke the sea surface before him, when their massive toothed heads breached the water to stare at him in his chair, to rest on the edge of his platform and sing back, Eli wept.\nBone length, wavelength, he thought.

I find his pyjamas and diaper beneath the rumpled blanket. The apartment is cold, the balcony door ajar. It\u2019s a soggy December night out there, and Ben is perched on the banister: talons gripping steel, wings flared. Below, the dark street is slick with rain. When he sees me, he swoops down toward the ground, past the building\u2019s manicured shrubbery and garden; heavy, webbed wings flapping as he soars down the street.\nI rush down the fire stairs, through the bowels of the sleeping building, ragged, blood-tasting breaths clawing at my throat. Outside, I see Ben flying low around the traffic lights at the intersection, and I run after him: through the drizzle, through the pools of light below the streetlamps, through the wide spaces of darkness in between. I\u2019m running barefoot in my washed out pyjamas, untied bathrobe flapping behind me like a cloak, like a pair of useless wings.\nIt\u2019s a nightmare, except that the asphalt really hurts my feet.\nBen lands in a tree. It\u2019s in an empty lot, full of brambles, weed-cracked concrete, moldering fruit trees, and scattered garbage. He sits, small and dark, on the branch above me, out of reach. His body is a new shape, one I\u2019ve never seen before, not this fully realized, its form revealed by the distant yellow glow from the street: shrivelled, scaly skin; clawed feet and forelegs; rippling folds of leathery wings rustling in the shadows. Only the eyes are familiar: large, round, nocturnal. I\u2019ve seen those eyes watching me from the crib at the foot of the bed more nights than I can count. Sometimes he\u2019s come crawling over to me, scuttling up the wall and across the ceiling before dropping down softly next to me. The sharp claws and teeth cut my skin sometimes, but I know he doesn\u2019t mean it, not really.\n\u201cCome down!\u201d I yell, but Ben only cocks his head and peers down at me.\nI stand there in the wet grass and dirt, looking up at the impenetrable sky. Ben looks too.\nThey\u2019re coming for him, I think. That\u2019s why he\u2019s out here. He\u2019s waiting for them. The ones who know his name, the ones who took his true shape from me, the ones who left him behind.\nThis is me a year ago, stretched out on the exam table at the ultrasound clinic: shirt pulled up, pants pulled down, bladder uncomfortably full, the gel on my stomach cold and sticky to the touch. There\u2019s the smile slipping off the ultrasound technician\u2019s face like soap and water. There\u2019s his hand trembling as he takes notes. Now he turns the screen so that Paul and I can\u2019t see the undulating shapes his wand has conjured from my womb. Beneath my hand there is a ripple, a shudder, the shape of it showing through my skin: the curve of a spine, perhaps, or the coil of an arm. Maybe an errant knee, slithering by as the small body looks for comfort inside me.\nAnd here I am, later that same day at the hospital, listening to the medical team\u2019s hushed voices while I am being wheeled into the operating room, clutching Paul\u2019s hand.\n\u201cThe baby is fine, Em. I just know it.\u201d He sounds so sure.\nA sheet blocks my view when they cut Ben out of me. It is nothing like we trained for all these months: no Mozart, no warm showers, no timed contractions. But there he is: safe, not dead, not yet. Whisked away to be judged and bathed, weighed and measured.\nThe doctor is talking to Paul somewhere above my head: \u201cno visible abnormalities, faulty ultrasound\u2026\u201d I am not listening. There is a small eye peering up at me, seeing me for the first time, and I feel that look bind me: fear and love and pain tightly intertwined, inseparable strands, rough and strong. A knotted noose tightening around my neck.\nFor three weeks after that, Ben sleeps in an incubator, alone: an IV in his arm, a feeding tube down his throat, an oxygen monitor pinching his tiny foot. Sometimes I wonder what he remembers. Does he remember unknown voices speaking a name he did not know was his? Does he remember unknown eyes peering down at him from on high to determine what he lacks? Does he remember unknown hands touching and holding him, making his body quiver with secret dreams of scales and fangs and fur?\nBen sits on the branch above me, so still that he might be sleeping, head tucked beneath a folded, leathery wing. In the dirt and weeds below, I wait and shiver in my washed out pyjamas and threadbare despair. Thinking:\nThey always take the firstborn.\nAs if this were a fairy-tale told by the fire, or read at bedtime. As if something unseen and Other had slipped out of long forgotten glades and hollows, slithering in beneath the light, beneath the softness of my own skin, into the tiny red dream fluttering inside my womb, claiming him, whispering his name \u2013 his real name, the one bonded to flesh and bone, the name that keeps calling him away from me.\nThis is the first time Ben shifts. He\u2019s two months old and it\u2019s the first day I\u2019m alone with him after Paul goes back to work. There it is: the jagged crest popping out of his back when I put him in the plastic tub for his bath, clawed feet splashing, my hands scratched and bleeding when I try to hold him, slippery-soft baby skin turned to rough scales, saw-toothed gums snapping at my fingers. I try to get a grip on him, try to make him stop, try to make the jagged crest along his spine disappear, until I realize I\u2019m holding him under the water.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the gash of gills slashed into his neck, I would have drowned him.\nOnce I get him out of the bath, I wrap him tightly in a towel and sit with him \u2013 rocking, holding \u2013 until he falls asleep. I think I hear a whisper or an echo, then, far off. A noise rather than a word. Like a name, being called out again and again when someone is lost in the woods. I feel it tug at him, and me. Ben stirs and whimpers but does not wake.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper, tugging back as hard as I can, fearing even then that it will not be enough.\nLater, when I unwrap him, there are no scales or gills or webbed extremities, only my own blood, shed from lacerated fingers.\n\u201cBen!\u201d\nI call the name into the December night, and it leaves my mouth in puff of despair and mist. I call it, as though it belongs to him, but I know it\u2019s not the right name, not the one he is waiting for.\n\u201cBen, you have to come down. We have to go home.\u201d\nThe beak clacks. The eyes glower.\nThe flaw is mine as much as his. No. More mine than his. A mother\u2019s love is supposed to be clean and whole. Not tattered and rent like mine. It should be pastels and flannel, hearts and cherubs. Never once was it like that for me. Always the knotted noose. Always the precipice and the abyss.\nThis is Ben at eighteen weeks. He still can\u2019t roll over. All the other babies in the parent and infant group can roll from stomach to back, but he won\u2019t even try. He just lays there, flat on his fleece blanket, cheek resting on the soft fabric. When I prod him to move, all he does is chew his fist.\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a content baby.\u201d The other mom leans over to get a better look, and I keep my eyes on the drool-soaked patch below Ben\u2019s chin, hoping she won\u2019t notice the wing stumps writhing beneath his loose, duck-patterned onesie. \u201cBut so small! Do you breastfeed?\u201d\nI flush.\n\u201cNo, he never latched.\u201d\n\u201cTatiana wouldn\u2019t latch either at first, but you just have to be firm and keep at it. Once they\u2019re really hungry they just grab on.\u201d\nI think of tiny Ben wailing, red-faced and desperate, mouth wet and ravenous; I think of the lactation consultant poking and prodding my breasts and nipples to get them in the right position. I think of leaking, aching, rock-hard breasts, full of milk and colostrum. I think of football holds and cradle holds. I think of Ben, not latching, not rolling over, soft wings tucked in close next to his spine.\nContent. Small. Failing. Just like me.\nAt home, in the dark hallway, when I\u2019ve locked the door behind us, Ben gazes at me from the stroller, slitted pupils dilating. Curved, serrated claws reach for me. I snuggle him close on the couch, holding him tight \u2013 too tight \u2013 his whimpering, wet nose snuffling against my skin, sharp claws scratching at my ribcage.\nI don\u2019t want to hurt him. Not that. Not ever. But sometimes, somewhere, in the hairline crack between the seen and the unsaid; between what Ben is and what I imagined him to be, opaque dreams quiver and unfurl beneath my skin: my nails the claws, my mouth the maw, my teeth the fangs \u2013 ripping, tearing.\nI wait beneath the tree. Minutes pass, hours, eons. Ben does not come down. Instead he spreads his wings and dives into the blackberry brambles. I can hear him rustling around in there, hissing and snapping. He returns with something squirming and dying; beak ripping at skin and tail.\n\u201cStop it, Ben!\u201d I\u2019m screaming now. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d\nHe ignores me, just cleans his beak and claws after feeding.\nI know it\u2019s all my fault. I ate processed meat during pregnancy. I slept on my back. I took medicine for heartburn. I used scented body lotion. I didn\u2019t use organic cotton washcloths. And, worst of all, I left him alone in that incubator.\n\u201cPlease, come down, Ben. Come to mommy.\u201d\nI cry, for myself as much as for him, but Ben seems as unconcerned with my tears as with the cold and rain. I can\u2019t even tell if he\u2019s listening. He just shifts his feet, scraping the branch, rustling the wings, head cocked to peer up at the empty sky.\nCome, I pray to the sky, to the darkness, to the stillness beneath the trees and brambles. Come, now. Don\u2019t leave him here with me. Come and take him away.\n\u201cDoes anything about your baby worry you? If yes, explain.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any concerns about your baby\u2019s behavior? If yes, explain.\u201d\nThis is me at the kitchen table, pencil hovering above the Ages and Stages questionnaire from the Health Unit.\n\u201cDo you think Ben seems alright?\u201d I ask Paul while Ben rubs mashed sweet potato into the table, smile glinting with new baby-teeth.\nBefore Paul came home, Ben\u2019s mouth kept shifting to red maw and fangs, then back again \u2013 jaws clacking tentatively as if he were practicing, long red tongue tasting the air, tasting my skin.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? He\u2019s not getting sick is he?\u201d\nI feel my resolve deflating as Ben waves his chubby arms and puts orange mash in his hair.\nI can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t say the words out loud, can\u2019t write them down even in pencil.\n\u201cIf yes, explain.\u201d\nYes means going back to the hospital. It means tubes taped to Ben\u2019s skin, snaking into every cavity and orifice. It means doctors staring at him like something to be taken apart for repair and cleaning.\n\u201cHe seems OK, right?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s great,\u201d Paul laughs and picks him up. \u201cBest monkey around, right, bud?\u201d\nAnd here I am, later that night, waking up to Ben\u2019s soft hands grasping for skin and warmth beneath the covers. It\u2019s September and the bedroom window is open. Somehow I know that Ben squeezed out through that window; that he balanced on the window sill three floors above the ground, thinking of taking flight, waiting for someone, something, to call his name.\nThe bathroom-light peels away every trace of who I am and who I have been, leaving only the dark circles under my eyes and the blood on Ben\u2019s limbs. He screams while I wash him. The blood isn\u2019t his, but he keeps screaming no matter what I offer him: formula, dry diaper, a long-discarded soother, blanket, rattle. The light peels away my face, too, leaving only a blank space: I can\u2019t even remember what I look like anymore.\nI think of leaving Ben in the tree. Of never letting him into the apartment, even if he pecks at the window and scratches at the door. I think of running away and never coming back: somewhere no one can find me, somewhere so far away that I won\u2019t be able to remember any of this. But I\u2019m bound. I have been bound, hand and foot, word and deed, from the moment Ben peered up at me, swaddled in that pale green hospital towel.\n\u201cPlease come down. Come to mommy. Mommy just wants you to come down.\u201d\nI say it, but I\u2019m not sure I mean it anymore. He knows it, too. The beak clacks, the wings rustle.\nThis is Ben, turning one just before Christmas. My cousin brings her child to Christmas dinner: a girl, same age as Ben, but twice as tall, running down the hallway, talking, singing. Ben sits. He hasn\u2019t taken a single step yet, not even when I hold his hands. At the table, the girl grabs the food and eats with skilled, dextrous fingers. My family stares at Ben\u2019s messy bib and clumsy spoon as though they\u2019re watching a documentary on TV.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so small.\u201d\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\n\u201cBut such a content baby.\u201d\nBen holds on tightly to the spoon, focused on his bowl, and for just a moment somewhere between the turkey and the trifle, I wish that he would brandish his serrated claws and gaping maw at everyone around that table. Just once, to shut them up.\nBen and I are alone in the dark. The night is rippling with furtive sounds: fluttering whispers beneath the leaves, the quiet scratch of claws beneath the roots, hissing breaths slithering through the brambles.\nBen.\nI hold his name in my mouth, unspoken: I know no name or word will call him back to me now. His fierce gaze touches me only briefly \u2013 impatient, glowering. Then he turns away.\nThis is me and Ben at the pediatrician yesterday. Scale and measuring tape and growth chart. Ben stripped down to nothing but his diaper. His graph: weight, length, head circumference, all plotted in way down at the bottom of the paper, far below any known percentile. I keep my eyes on Ben\u2019s face: round and smooth and flawless.\nThere is an aching tightness in my chest and throat: like drowning, like suffocating, like holding my breath. Like not screaming. Like not shouting for help.\n\u201cHe\u2019s having some problems with his developmental milestones.\u201d\nThe doctor is riffling through his papers and doesn\u2019t even look up when I speak.\n\u201cPreemies usually catch up after a while,\u201d he says, \u201cand he seems very content.\u201d\n\u201cHe screamed all night. I couldn\u2019t get him to calm down.\u201d\nThe doctor looks at Ben. Ben is calm: all zen and bliss and halo. No sign of scales, no claws, no snout, no wings.\n\u201cCould be gas, or maybe colic or teething pain. These things can come and go.\u201d I nod. Pretending to be a normal mother, but not sure if I can manage it any longer. \u201cHow much preemie was he again?\u201d\n\u201cSix weeks.\u201d\n\u201cOh well, not so bad, then.\u201d\nBen looks at me. Trusting. Knowing.\n\u201cNo, not so bad.\u201d\nI look up at the sky, waiting for it to open, but it remains closed. No one is coming for him. There is no one else left in the world except Ben and me. There is no one who can help me. There is no one who can see what is happening, no one who can stop it.\nBen looks down at me, expectantly.\nI\u2019m so tired: tired of crying, tired of screaming and begging. The night is cold and silent. It holds no answers, no prayers, no lullabies, no dreams. I am empty, hollowed out, scraped clean. I am nothing: not Em, not mother, not woman, not even human, anymore. I am a smudge of cold and shadow beneath a tree in a forgotten place in an abandoned world.\nAnd then I feel it. Like a burning tingle along my spine as leathery wings sprout and grow, ripping through my pyjamas. I feel the bathrobe fall away as I shed its useless, pale blue husk. I feel claws and beak push out of cartilage and bone, and I gaze into the darkness, penetrating it with my new, protruding eyes.\nFlapping heavily off the ground up into the tree, I roost next to Ben on the branch. There is a scrap of meat stuck in his talons and I peck at it, ripping it loose, swallowing it. The world looks different from up here: clear and sharp, even in the dark. Beyond the tree, beyond the empty lot, the city is an alien planet, a pit of despair lit by distant lights: stars or windows, burning houses or campfires, out of reach.\nSo much I never knew. So much I\u2019ve forgotten.\nI stretch my wings, feel the fierce heat of this new heart burn away my grief and fear and sins, honing me into something sharper, harder. Something strong. Something true. I look at Ben and know he feels it, too. He sits silently beside me and I coo his name \u2013 his real name, the one bonded to flesh and bones \u2013 his green eyes glowing as I take flight.\nMaria Haskins is a Swedish-Canadian writer and certified translator.

Even if it was just a ploy to get rid of extra stock, there must be some value in whatever the booksellers would pick for her.\nSo she took a long lunch on a Friday and drove down to see what she could find.\nFor a palace of marvels, it wasn\u2019t particularly impressive. The building used to be a bank, still had a crumbling vestigial overhang that used to mark the drive-thru lane. It wasn\u2019t busy. A group of teenagers skipping school loitered around a Toyota older than they were in the parking lot, taking in some obscure code Annie had no wish to crack. One or two other cars dotted the lot at odd intervals. Annie had parked as far from them as she could\u2014she always did, anxious about accidentally scraping someone else\u2019s car\u2014and the walk to the door made her stomach curl with unanticipated dread.\nThe Orangerie, the new sign above the door read.\nWeird name.\n\u201cJust looking\u201d was already on her lips to answer a pushy sales associate, but no one was behind the counter to greet her with fake smiles or canned pleasantries. A few patrons wended their way through the maze of bookshelves. None appeared to notice her, and they were each indistinct and insubstantial, as though she couldn\u2019t really recall their presence when not looking directly at them.\nAnnie smiled at the unexpected pleasure of that.\nA house of books had always felt to Annie like a house of God. Even one as outwardly uninspiring as The Orangerie, with cheap particleboard shelving set up apparently at random, and the ghosts of old bank notices still visible on the windows and walls, had that air about it. Paper, ink, dust. Convenient portals to a thousand different worlds.\nShe chose a row at random, and walked slowly, trailing her fingers over the spines of books. Some had been much loved or much abused\u2014cracked spines, torn corners, sticky with fingerprints. Others were outwardly whole, but betrayed age and irrelevance with dated typography, unfashionable covers.\nThere did not seem to be an organizational method, as far as Annie could tell. Large cookbooks crowded next to genre paperbacks. Car repair manuals shared space with a set of children\u2019s encyclopedias from the sixties. There would be no way to find a specific title here. She would have to let luck guide her.\nThere was no point in impatience. She knew that she would find something that called to her. And, eventually, she did. A thick biography of Mary Wollstonecraft caught her eye long enough for a second look. She did not generally read biographies, but as her knowledge of Wollstonecraft was confined to Jeopardy trivia and a vague memory of reading A Vindication of the Rights of Women in high school, it seemed like an interesting choice.\nAn orange sticker on the spine was marked six dollars. A bit more expensive than her lunch would have cost, but she could justify it. She cradled the book in the crook of her arm and headed to the counter.\nNow there was an employee\u2014a tall, gangly youth with messy hair and about twenty earrings arrayed along the curve of their left ear. Annie wondered where they had been when she came in, how they knew exactly when to appear.\nThe bookseller had a nametag that read only Barrow. They were not overly chatty, but rang up Annie\u2019s purchase with a genuine grin, mentioning that they\u2019d read the biography before, and loved it. Annie handed over her six crumpled dollars, and waited. Barrow folded themself over to rummage beneath the counter, then produced Annie\u2019s free book.\nThe Secret History of the Clockwork King by Michael Ryan Martin.\nAll of Annie\u2019s nerves seemed to short out; an electrifying spark ran through her. \u201cThat\u2026\u201d she said, fingers inching towards the cover, not quite daring to trace the silhouette of the titular character \u201c\u2026this isn\u2019t what I need.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Barrow insisted, evenly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d she said. Who would play such an elaborate prank as this? How would they even know?\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Barrow repeated. Their fingers brushed hers as they pushed the impossible book more firmly towards her. \u201cHave a wonderful day.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t go back to work. Didn\u2019t even bother to call. Instead she went home, barely even conscious of the drive. She turned off her phone, curled up on the couch. And stared at the book in her hands.\nThere had to be thousands of people named Michael Martin. Even the middle name Ryan, that must be so common. It was only a coincidence. It had to be. To indulge in any other thought was insanity.\nBut\u2026.The Secret History of the Clockwork King.\nThe cover image was of a man, shadowed and distant, crowned with a vicious, jagged crown, holding aloft a sword in a martial, victorious pose.\nAnnie had never had very much artistic skill, but when Mike first started telling her this story, she had tried her hand at illustrating scenes for him. The more it amused him, the more she drew. And this image, she remembered. It had been crude when she drew it. Here, it was polished and professional. But either way, it had come from her head.\nFor Mike\u2019s story.\nShe opened the book, and started at page one.\nThree hundred and thirty-seven pages later, she closed the book, and started to sob.\nAnnie was always the sick one, is the thing. She\u2019s the one who got ear infections every spring, and the flu, the one who had chicken pox, the one whose appendix burst, the one who could get food poisoning just from accidentally smelling potato salad that had sat out on the picnic table ten minutes too long.\nMike was never sick a day in his life. He was into sports\u2014all sports, every sport\u2014and most of Annie\u2019s memories of him feature a revolving rainbow of local league uniforms, for basketball and soccer and baseball and lacrosse. He had been trying to bulk up for football tryouts before his freshman year when they found out.\nHis heart, his big, strong heart, had a hole in it. He\u2019d been damaged all along, while Annie was taking up everyone\u2019s attention with her petty hurts, and suddenly, the bill had come due.\nThere were options. None of them were very good. None of them would work, in the end.\nAnnie\u2019s baby brother had never been still a day in his life. From the day he learned to roll over, he was off like a shot, and he never settled down. Even in sleep he twisted and tossed, he kicked, he thrashed.\nBut suddenly there were hospital beds, and drugs that made his eyes go spacey, and needles, and tubes. Forget tossing and turning. After the first surgery, he lay prone for so long that when it finally came time to stand up, he couldn\u2019t even do that on his own.\nSo there were endless rounds of the hospital corridors with the walker, Annie and their parents and a rotating roster of Mike\u2019s friends all hovering behind him as he took one slow, painful step after another.\nThere were experimental medicines, and a second surgery to fix the consequences of the first. There were spontaneous bleeding events. There were bad reactions to medication. There were months at a time when he got to come home, and then there were long, unexpected weeks back in the ICU. There were wake-up calls for medications and blood draws every four hours, on the dot. Annie learned how to do homework in the hospital waiting room. Mom quit her job. Mike was young, he had always been healthy, he was supposed to get better. Everyone insisted that he would get better.\nAnd he did not.\nAnnie stayed at the hospital through the night, sometimes, because night was usually when he was awake. He hated to sleep, anymore, hated the hospital when it was quiet and dark. He didn\u2019t know what to do with himself, stuck inside that prison of a bed.\nSo Annie would stay, and they would talk. Sometimes he made sense. Sometimes the drugs made his speech airy and hard to understand. But it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cI see stuff, when I close my eyes,\u201d he said to her one night. She assumed he was talking about the drugs, and maybe he was, but what he started to tell her was a story.\nShe had always been the bookish one in the family. She read Pierce and Le Guin on the sidelines of Mike\u2019s soccer games, Tolkien and Wrede at his basketball meets. She had even written a fanfic or two, though she\u2019d never been able to get over her embarrassment and show anyone.\nBut Mike, who had always struggled to read, never had patience for anything denser than middle-grade sports novels, was suddenly telling her a story.\nIt was about a young man, a king, who went off to war and steadily lost pieces of himself in every battle. He defied his advisors and insisted that he must lead every charge and face every foe head on, but such recklessness carried with it consequences. It was also the story of a brilliant surgeon, a young woman who thought they key to immortality was hidden in her studies of the healing arts, and how she fashioned the young king into something different to what he had been, something more.\n\u201cYou have to start writing this down,\u201d Annie whispered after one night of the tale, hardly daring to breath.\nMike laughed, or tried to. \u201cIt\u2019s just this dumb thing in my head. Helps the time pass.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s better than good.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to humor me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s\u2026you have to start writing this down.\u201d\nWhen she pulled into the parking lot on Saturday morning, Annie half-expected The Orangerie to have disappeared, building and all. That was what happened with magic, wasn\u2019t it?\nBut, no. Outwardly, it looked pretty much the same. The sign was slightly faded, which seemed odd, but Annie figured that it was more her mood that made everything seem slightly dull rather than any real, physical reason.\nThe book sat next to her on the passenger seat. Her brother\u2019s book. Her brother\u2019s book, with her brother\u2019s picture in the back\u2014a receding hairline she had never seen, the same dimpled smile she\u2019d always known\u2014and a dedication the front that read To A, For Making Me Write It Down.\nHer brother had been dead for eighteen years\u2014one year longer than he got to be alive\u2014and she had a novel with a publication date only one year old sitting on her passenger seat, and she needed to know how.\nThe same exact teenagers were loitering in the otherwise empty parking lot, though they seemed older, somehow. Yesterday, she\u2019d thought they were high school students, but now they seem more like they belonged in college. They might even be as old as twenty, twenty-one. They didn\u2019t pay any attention to her as she crossed the lot, and she wondered why her brain was even bothering to make the observation. She had much bigger things to deal with than young people hanging out in parking lots.\nThis time she headed straight to the counter. The book hit with a thud that was louder than she anticipated, and she tried not to jump at the sound. A girl was behind the counter\u2014brown, curvy, purple-haired. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\u201cI need to speak to Barrow, please.\u201d\nThe girl furrowed her brow. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cBarrow. Tall, about a million piercings? I know they may not be on shift but I need to find out when they\u2019ll be back. Please.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone called Barrow. What kind of name is that?\u201d\nAnnie nearly screamed in frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s their name. Look, I was here yesterday, and Barrow picked out my free book, and I really need to speak with them about it.\u201d\nThe girl suddenly straightened, remembering her script. \u201cOh, The Host? Sorry, you can\u2019t return that here. We still have, like, three boxes in the back. Just be glad you didn\u2019t come in when we had Dewey the Library Cat; I thought we\u2019d never get rid of those.\u201d\nAnnie sputtered, confused. She pushed Mike\u2019s book across the counter, though she was suddenly reluctant to let it out of her grasp. \u201cWhat? No. This book. I need to know where Barrow got this book?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I told you, there\u2019s no one named Barrow who works here. I couldn\u2019t give out employee information even if there was.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything else I can help you find? This one is, what, steampunk? We\u2019ve got a couple others in that genre hiding around here.\u201d\nAnnie didn\u2019t need more books. She needed to know where this book came from.\nHow could Barrow not exist? Annie was a rational person. She couldn\u2019t have just made the person up. After all, she still had the book. That had to prove\u2026something.\nFrustrated, she scooped The Secret History of the Clockwork King back up and fled the store. She kicked sullenly at the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, trying to figure out where to go next. A glint of light caught her eye and she looked up, spotted the young loiterers and their old shit-heap of a car.\nAnnie was well aware that she was\u2026well. Staid. Predictable. Boring. She liked routine, and she disliked impulsiveness, and what was wrong with that?\nBut what else was she going to do today?\nShe walked over to the kids, acutely aware that the sort of young who travel in packs could almost certainly smell fear. Mike had been like these kids before he got sick. Cool. Vital. Alive. Annie never had been, hiding behind her glasses and her good grades, always desperate to remain unseen. But she wasn\u2019t a kid anymore, so what did it matter?\n\u201cHey. Any of you know Barrow?\u201d\nA boy stretched out on the hood of the car looked her over. \u201cYeah, sure. Barrow\u2019s good people.\u201d\n\u201cKnow where I can find them?\u201d\nThe boy shrugged. One of the girls in the group chimed in. \u201cHey, is that The Clockwork King? Cool.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve read it?\u201d\n\u201cLike, three times. I can\u2019t wait for the sequel.\u201d\nAnnie\u2019s head buzzed. \u201cSequel?\u201d\n\u201cA Record of the Divine Service of the Royal Surgeon. About Leandra, obviously. She\u2019s such a badass super-genius, it\u2019s going to be lit.\u201d\nAnnie\u2019s voice cracked as she tried to hold back her desperation. \u201cWhere did you get this book? From Barrow?\u201d\n\u201cNah, lady,\u201d another kid piped up. \u201cFrom Amazon. You heard of it?\u201d\nHilarious.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Might as well lay it all out there. \u201cMy brother wrote this book. Mike. And I need to find Barrow, so I can find Mike.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d the kid from the hood of the car said, sliding off and heading towards the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cHop in.\u201d\n\u201cWh\u2014just like that? You don\u2019t think I sound crazy?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s crazy? Barrow\u2019s, like, the best wizard I\u2019ve ever seen. Ze can totally find your brother.\u201d\n\u201cHey, maybe we can get a sneak peak of A Record of the Divine Service of the Royal Surgeon. You know, as a finder\u2019s fee or whatever.\u201d\nAnnie peered dubiously into the car. There were five kids, plus her. \u201cUm, will we all fit?\u201d Would the car run, even if they did?\nThe driver, clearly the leader of the pack, rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat part of the word wizard don\u2019t you understand, lady? Come on. The quest for Barrow awaits!\u201d\nThis last was apparently said ironically, but Annie was still trying to figure out why they kept talking about wizards. Was it a Harry Potter thing? When had she gotten so completely out of touch with modern slang?\nShe squeezed into the backseat with the group\u2019s two girls, while one of the boys twisted like a contortionist to move into the front passenger seat and take up space on another boy\u2019s lap. And miraculously, the cramped car did seem to expand, slightly, once everyone was settled. The driver fought with the ignition, and the car sputtered to something resembling life, and they were off.\nOn page eighty-three of The Secret History of the Clockwork King, the young royal tries to explain to his surgeon for the first time why he is so insistent on leading every charge. He also tells her his name. Though the character is at that point only seventeen, his name has been kept secret for so long that he sometimes forgets it himself.\nJoazayal.\nThe scene is poignant and revealing, as the young king unburdens himself of all of his fears and apprehensions while the surgeon neatly stiches a gash along his arm. She does not look him in the eyes\u2014she will not be able to take such liberties for many chapters to come\u2014but she does clutch his hand, under the guise of checking the dexterity and force of his grip, and she says \u201cJoazayal. I will never forget it. I will hold that name sacred and safe until the end of my days. Forget again if you must, and know that I will carry it for you\u201d.\nWhen Mike recited that scene for her, Annie bawled. He went lipstick red\u2014a rarity, by then, when he had so little color\u2014and clammed up.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to cry in front of terminal patients. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s bad manners?\u201d\nShe threw a tissue, all she had at hand, at him. \u201cIdiot. You\u2019re not terminal.\u201d\n\u201cHey, gross, that has your snot and everything. I could get an infection!\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you learn to be so\u2026\u201d she trailed off, felt the weight of him watching her. \u201cWhere did you learn to make your characters so real?\u201d\n\u201cThe school of life,\u201d he intoned solemnly, and her answering giggle set of a chain reaction where he clutched desperately at his pillow to staunch the pain of his own laughter, and she felt a pang of guilt.\nAnnie never told anyone, but on the third anniversary of her brother\u2019s death, she went to a tattoo parlor. Just below her hairline, in a place that is hidden to all but the most intrusive of perusals, she had the name Joazayal inked into her skin. The artist didn\u2019t ask what it meant, and Annie didn\u2019t share. It was a secret, something she felt compelled to carry with her. She couldn\u2019t see it, she couldn\u2019t feel it, but it comforted her to know that it was there.\nThe kids were named Dewan and Upasana and Luna and Ryder and Jude. They kept talking over each other, or turning up the radio to wail the chorus to one abysmal, heavy-bass song after another. Upasana, the Clockwork King superfan, peppered Annie with questions about Mike, but they were predicated on the assumption that Mike was alive, and Annie didn\u2019t know how to answer them.\nShe clutched the book to her chest and watched the miles roll by.\nBarrow was a difficult wizard to find. They stopped at a record store, a coffee shop, a post office, each time the car sputtering to a halt so vociferously that Annie doubted it would start up again, each time a different kid getting out of the car without bothering to consult with the others. Annie didn\u2019t question the process. They would find Barrow, or they wouldn\u2019t. It was a quest. There were steps one had to follow.\nIt was dusk by the time they pulled up to an apartment complex. All the kids tumbled out of the car this time, Dewan poking his head back inside when he realized Annie hadn\u2019t followed. \u201cNumber 201. Upstairs. Ze doesn\u2019t like surprises, so I\u2019d stand back from the door after you knock.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\n\u201cAfter. The supplicant must face the trial alone.\u201d He put a soft hand to the space between her shoulder blades, gently pushed. \u201cGo on, lady. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Annie.\u201d\n\u201cStop stalling, Lady Annie.\u201d\nSo she squared her shoulders, and she climbed the stairs. The book was still pressed against her heart.\nShe knocked twice on the door to 201, then self-consciously hopped a few feet back. It took a few minutes, long enough that she considered knocking again, but suddenly Barrow was there, filling up the open doorway.\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s you.\u201d\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI expected you. People don\u2019t always come, but when I saw you back then, I thought, she\u2019ll be around.\u201d Ze stepped back. \u201cWelcome.\u201d\nHesitantly, Annie crossed the threshold. She\u2019d half-made herself imagine a shadowy lair of bubbling crucibles and dripping candles. It was just a regular old apartment with cheap beige carpet and low popcorn ceilings. There was a poster for Star Wars hung crookedly on the far wall.\n\u201cListen, the book you gave me yesterday\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWas it only yesterday, for you? You moved faster than I expected, Annie Martin.\u201d\nAnnie blinked. Had she shown Barrow her driver\u2019s license at some point? Or was this all some terrible, overcomplicated ruse to get her alone here, in this place?\n\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d\nBarrow gently took the book from her. \u201cThe Secret History of The Clockwork King. Pretty much your standard pseudo-medieval fantasy riff, but the guy shows promise. Great character work. Decent prose.\u201d\n\u201cMike is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDead?\u201d\nAnnie winced.\nThey took Mike\u2019s ashes to the beach, after. The place where they had spent all of their summers before his illness, where they had run around getting sunburned while their parents drank margaritas in the shade. Annie had lost one of her baby teeth on that beach, and when she cried about having nothing to give the tooth fairy, Mike offered to pull out one of his own. Mom figured out what they were up to before any damage was done, and just gave Annie the dollar that would otherwise have appeared that night under her pillow, but Annie never forgot what Mike had almost done for her.\nIt was a bright day when they scattered him over the water. Annie never went back to the beach, though her parents still made their annual pilgrimage, all these years on.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a secret,\u201d Barrow said, conspiratorially. \u201cHere, in this place, Mike Martin is a high school gym teacher. He\u2019s got pretty bad insomnia, so he started to write at night. Bright future. Couple industry awards down the road, maybe even a TV adaptation. And, yeah, some things are easier for him cause he\u2019s a cis white guy, but when you get down to it, the stories are pretty good all on their own.\u201d\nAnnie blinked back unexpected tears. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real. How is this real?\u201d\nBarrow smiled, and it transformed zir entire face. \u201cThe thing about books.\u201d Ze waggled The Clockwork King in emphasis. \u201cThe thing about books is they\u2019re keys. They\u2019re always keys, but most of the time people don\u2019t know how to use them. Or the people who could use them don\u2019t have them in the first place. You, though. I thought you might figure it out.\u201d\nThe implications of this spun out, too fast for Annie to catch. All she could ask was, \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t?\u201d\nBarrow shrugged. \u201cWell, then you\u2019d have an artifact from another world and a strange story to tell your friends. No harm, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cMike is alive.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go find out where he is.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a spell that can find people\u2019s addresses?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Google. Pretty sure you have it where you\u2019re from, too.\u201d\nGreat. She\u2019d slipped into another world, and everyone was a comedian.\n\u201cWait, am I here?\u201d she asked, suddenly apprehensive. \u201cI mean, another me?\u201d What might that look like? Who would Annie Martin be, in a world where her brother hadn\u2019t died?\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way. You can\u2019t open the door if there\u2019s a version of you on the other side of it.\u201d\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Dead. When?

Marie\u2019s little-girl voice is overloud. Loud enough to be heard by the caller on the other side of the door.\nFrom her armchair in the lounge, Nell glimpses a flash of pink as the child dashes the length of the hall, little feet running, the sound muffled by carpet out of date two decades ago. The child opens the front door. Nell pictures her in her Dora the Explorer skirt and Hannah Montana leggings, tip-toeing to reach the door handle.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cUm, is your mother there?\u201d A man. Youngish, with a rasping voice. A smoker, maybe.\n\u201cNo, Grandma is though. I can get her, but you\u2019ll have to wait a minute. The doctor says she\u2019s supposed to use her walker.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t make her get up.\u201d\nNell relaxes a little. It\u2019s not someone looking for them specifically. No one using their name\u2014just your generic everyday doorbell ringer. One of those polling people, asking questions about what medical insurance they have, or some do-gooder looking for sponsors to buy goats for Africa. Failing that, he\u2019ll be from the God Squad, any denomination. Take your pick. All types round here.\nStill, this place has been good, the community big enough for anonymity. Nell is sick of always moving on. Dragging the two of them from one crappy rental to the next. Low-rent housing, they call it. Which in Nell\u2019s experience means high rent but run-down to all shit. Nell would prefer to stay here. At eighty-four, she\u2019s tired of running.\n\u201cOkay, bye,\u201d Marie tells the man.\n\u201cOh, little girl, could you give your gran this for me, please?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl. I\u2019m Marie.\u201d\n\u201cMarie. That\u2019s a pretty name. Could you give this to your gran?\u201d The guy\u2019s a real trier. Probably a petition. That would make sense. The news has been full of demands for a referendum on mining. There\u2019s a quiet pause and Nell imagines the man pushing the paper through the gap as the door closes.\n\u201cOkay, bye,\u201d the child says again. Then she remembers her manners. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d Nell\u2019s heart clenches. Sometimes, after all these years, she still feels it. That deep sense of longing for a child. Love. That indescribable sense of promise, tinged with fear. Sometimes, if Nell closes her eyes, it\u2019s almost as if\u2026\nSighing, she slumps back in her chair. Best not to wish.\n\u201cYou can open your eyes now, you old trout. He\u2019s gone.\u201d\nNell is jolted back.\nThe child flings herself onto the sofa, letting the papers drop to the floor.\n\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d\n\u201cLawn mowing service.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay then. You didn\u2019t give anything away?\u201d\nA roll of the eyes. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. He has no idea.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I should get an academy award.\u201d Marie picks up a Barbie doll, a prop left on the living room floor in case anyone should happen to peer in a window, and begins pulling at its hair, swivelling the doll\u2019s neck in unnatural ways. \u201cYou know this won\u2019t do, don\u2019t you? We\u2019re going to have to go out soon. And not just to the bloody supermarket.\u201d\nNell looks up sharply. It\u2019s still a shock when Marie swears. Profanity\u2019s always so vulgar in a child. Nell bites back a reprimand.\n\u201cWell, we will,\u201d Marie insists, her little cherub mouth twisted in a sneer. \u201cWe need to find someone, don\u2019t we?\u201d She yanks cruelly at the doll\u2019s ponytail, pulling its neck backwards.\nNell nods. \u201cI know, love. We will. Tomorrow, okay? It\u2019s just, I\u2019ve been so tired today.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you were tired yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the day before.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cPromise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPromise!\u201d the child shrieks. She throws the doll across the room. It bounces on the floor, its head coming away, while the body rolls under the sofa.\n\u201cYes dear, we\u2019ll go out and look for someone tomorrow. I promise,\u201d Nell says.\n\u201cWe\u2019d better,\u201d the child warns. She runs off to play in her room, leaving the headless Barbie under the sofa.\nNell looks up the addresses of a couple of clinics in the yellow pages. The first one\u2019s no good. Too far away. But the second one is closer and looks like it might be private.\nThey catch the bus to the commercial centre\u2014waiting for the low floored bus for Nell\u2019s walking frame\u2014and walk the last two blocks to the clinic. By the time they arrive, Nell\u2019s back aches and her legs are shaking. She wonders how long she\u2019ll be able to continue, if they don\u2019t find someone this summer.\nOutside the clinic, Nell sinks gratefully onto the painted bench. Marie sits beside her, her skirt falling in tidy pleats. Together they watch the clinic\u2019s clients come and go: well-dressed, neatly-coiffed women, their hands gripped tight by solemn-faced men. People wanting a baby. Nell knows how that feels. She\u2019d always wanted a baby. So much so, she\u2019d stopped taking the precious pills. David had been furious\u2014she\u2019d lost him over it, ending up a single mother in the sixties\u2014but Nell didn\u2019t regret it; she\u2019d got what she wanted, and it\u2019s the same thing that brings these couples to the clinic.\nNell scrutinises Marie\u2019s face each time a woman descends the tiled steps. She feels like a detective, as if the child were her witness, and the women part of a line-up. Mostly, the women arrive with their partners, but sometimes they come alone. The women on their own are the ones that Nell and Marie are interested in.\nChewing her lip, and fiddling absently with her christening bangle, Marie regards each one.\nNell leans in close. \u201cWhat about that one?\u201d\nMarie shakes her head. \u201cToo fat.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYes, really.\u201d\n\u201cThat might be a good thing. It could mean she\u2019s a good cook.\u201d\nMarie glares at Nell. \u201cI said, no.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. What about her? The one coming now. She looks nice.\u201d\n\u201cToo young. She\u2019ll want a dolly, a little girl to dress up.\u201d\n\u201cNow, you don\u2019t know that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any idea how much I detest pink?\u201d Marie hisses. \u201cDo you? Do you even care?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, love. I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cYou never think. That\u2019s the problem. Anyway, she\u2019s too young\u2014just look at her.\u201d\nNell studies the woman, her heels clattering cheerfully as she skips down the stairs. Wearing a white sundress sprigged with tiny yellow roses, the vibrancy of her outfit matches the bounce in her step. Marie\u2019s right. This one won\u2019t do. They can\u2019t afford to fail another time.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Marie says scornfully. \u201cI told you, we have to wait for someone older. Someone sad.\u201d\nAnother hour passes before a mousy-haired woman in her late thirties, or perhaps her early forties, leaves the clinic. Her eyes are rimmed red and she carries a crumpled tissue in her hand.\nMarie nudges Nell. \u201cThis one.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nNow that they\u2019re about to go through with it, Nell\u2019s resolve melts. Her head aches. She can\u2019t do it. In spite of everything, letting the child go will break her heart. Nell\u2019s about to pull her back, but already Marie has slipped off the painted wooden bench, her little legs carrying her along the sidewalk away from Nell.\nNo\u2026\nApproaching the woman with purpose, at the last minute Marie gets shy. Ducking her head bashfully, she tugs at the woman\u2019s top. \u201cExcuse me, are you my new mummy?\u201d she says, curling the tip of a pigtail in her fingers.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be adopted. I\u2019m going to get a new mummy.\u201d\nThe woman bursts into tears.\nNell hesitates, stomach churning. She doesn\u2019t want to go through with it\u2014this charade\u2014but Marie tilts her head, and Nell catches the warning in her eyes, demanding that Nell play her part.\nNell owes it to her to try. The woman\u2019s blubbering looks to be slowing.\n\u201cMarie,\u201d Nell admonishes. She makes a show of struggling to her feet. It isn\u2019t hard to be convincing, Nell\u2019s been sat here on these slats for so long. \u201cCome away now, darling. Let\u2019s leave the nice lady alone.\u201d Nell grips the back of the bench and extends an arm awkwardly. Seeing her difficulty, the woman steps forward to push the walking frame within reach. Nell gives her a grateful nod.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry if Marie upset you. We\u2019re supposed to be meeting a representative from the adoption agency. She hasn\u2019t turned up: the little one\u2019s getting impatient.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re meeting an adoption agency? Here?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Marie says. Curls bobbing, she looks up from under her lashes. \u201cI\u2019m getting a new mummy.\u201d Then, dropping her voice to a whisper, she says: \u201cMy other mummy can\u2019t look after me anymore.\u201d\nOver Marie\u2019s head, the woman looks questioningly at Nell, who gives her a meaningful nod. Turns out, Nell\u2019s not so shabby at acting either. She should nominate herself as Best Supporting Actress.\nNell shuffles up the front path, and frowns. Marie\u2019s form is visible at the window, peeking out from behind the mildewy nets. Nell had told her to stay out of sight. The last thing they need is an interfering neighbour calling the authorities. Not now when they\u2019re so close.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Marie says, jumping down from the suitcase she\u2019d been standing on, and rushing forward. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got back. It\u2019s been ages. What happened? Are they going to take me?\u201d\nNell\u2019s heart clenches. She\u2019s hardly taken a step inside the hall. Is Marie in such a hurry to get away?\n\u201cGive me a sec to sit down,\u201d she says. Placing the manila envelope on the battered side table, she abandons the walker and makes her way to her chair in the living room, using first the walls, and then the furniture for support.\n\u201cCome on. Hurry up!\u201d Marie says, wind-milling her arms. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re sitting down now. What did they say?\u201d\nNell looks at her, the baby she\u2019d wanted so badly, and is assailed by memories: Marie climbing into Nell\u2019s lap for a story, Marie licking the cream off a doughnut, her animated little girl chatter, the bubbles of laughter.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to take you,\u201d she whispers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to take me!\u201d Marie chortles joyfully. \u201cYay!\u201d She jumps on the sofa.\n\u201cThey accepted the paperwork,\u201d Nell says, while Marie bounces. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t mention bringing in their lawyer, so they know what we\u2019re offering isn\u2019t exactly legal.\u201d\nMarie stops jumping, her toes curled on the sofa cushions. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly legal,\u201d she retorts.\nNell gives a little sigh. \u201cYes love, but it\u2019s best to let them think otherwise, that the adoption\u2019s a little unconventional. We don\u2019t want them asking any hairy questions. They really want you, Marie. They\u2019re desperate for a child. They would have preferred a baby\u2014well everyone does these days\u2014but they\u2019re happy to have a daughter. And you\u2019ll never believe it: Tim\u2019s mother\u2019s name was Marie.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes. Of course, they want me. I\u2019m irresistible,\u201d Marie says, her voice full of sarcasm. She jumps down from the sofa. \u201cSo, I assume there are no other snotty offspring?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s as we expected. The Hammonds can\u2019t have children. They were on their final attempt at IVF when we found Paula outside the clinic.\u201d\nMarie nods. \u201cWhat was the house like?\u201d\n\u201cIt was lovely. You\u2019ll like it,\u201d Nell says trying to sound enthusiastic. \u201cIt\u2019s a big house: four double bedrooms, with a beautiful yard out back for you to play in.\u201d\nMarie frowns. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby.\u201d\nNell\u2019s eyes stray to the sofa where Marie\u2019s Barbie\u2019s legs stick out from under the base. \u201cThey think you are,\u201d she says softly.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to show them, won\u2019t I?\u201d\nNell leans forward and lays a hand on her arm. \u201cMarie, you\u2019ll have to be careful. You should do as we discussed and take things slowly. The Hammonds have to fall love with you completely before you tell them the truth. They\u2019re going to find out eventually, but we don\u2019t want them to discover too soon.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know, I know.\u201d Marie snatches her arm away. \u201cStop going on about it. I\u2019m careful. I\u2019m always careful. No one\u2019s found out so far, have they?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but there was\u2014\u201d\nMarie stamps her foot.\n\u201cSorry, love. You know I just want the best for you. I want you to be safe\u2014\u201d\nMarie, eager, cuts her off. \u201cWhen? When can I go?\u201d\n\u201cWednesday,\u201d Nell says, her eyes welling up. \u201cWe\u2019ll go on the bus, the day after tomorrow.\u201d\nMoonlight streaming across the bed from a gap in the curtains, Nell buries her face in her hands, and stifles her sobs. It\u2019s done now. Nell knows it. But losing her hurts so much, as if Nell\u2019s heart is being ripped from her chest. Marie had been so happy when she\u2019d learned about the Hammonds. She\u2019d done a little dance, while Nell shattered into splinters.\nOf course, Nell can understand it. It\u2019s been so hard for Marie, being five, and she\u2019s been disappointed before. The last time they\u2019d come close to having her adopted, Nell had changed her mind, unable to go through with it. Well, when is a mother ever ready to let her child go?\nNell labours to shift her hips sideways off a wrinkle in the sheets. Not that it matters what she wants. No one is granting her wishes these days, anyway. There was only that one time, decades ago when Marie was five, on a night not unlike this one, when Nell had lay in her bed and wished her little girl would stay that way forever.\nShe blinks back tears. No, no wishing. Marie absolutely has to leave tomorrow. There\u2019s no backing out this time. Nell\u2019s just too old. Any longer and the authorities might take Marie and who knows what might happen then?\nBut Nell loves her so much! If only Marie didn\u2019t have to leave.\nThe moonlight striking her face, Nell closes her eyes, and remembers her as a tiny baby. Her perfect, perfect baby girl. Chestnut curls, soft brown eyes, and dimples to drown in.\nNell doesn\u2019t want to let her little girl go.\nThe bottom drawer open, Marie picks out a Care-Bear t-shirt. Nope. Not taking that. She flings it into a corner for Nell to throw away when she\u2019s gone, then plunges her hand into the drawer again, this time pulling out a cheap hypermarket dress, a yellow one with Belle on the front. God, she hates Disney. Over the years, Marie\u2019s wardrobe has included every Disney princess from Snow White to the Snow Queen. Nell insisted it was good camouflage, making Marie indistinguishable from the other little girls. At least this one isn\u2019t pink. Marie reaches over to put it in her \u2018maybe\u2019 pile, but she stumbles and slips, gouging her leg on the corner of the drawer.\nFuck it.\nShe sits on the floor with her back to the bed and examines the gash on her shin. Runs her finger over the welt, and sucks the blood off her finger. Not too deep. With a bit of luck it might not scar too much.\nJust another to add to her collection.\nThe network of raised white welts are the reason Marie stopped going to school. It was boring anyway. Always the same stuff: greeting the teacher, counting to twenty, reciting the alphabet. Once you know how to read, it can be so tedious reciting that crap day after day. But schools have libraries and computers and other things to entertain, so she\u2019d been prepared to tolerate the dull-witted babies and clucky infant mistresses. A few times she\u2019d made it to Year Four before staff started to comment about how much smaller Marie was compared to other children her age. About twenty schools in\u2014Marie lost count\u2014a well-intentioned school nurse had noticed Marie\u2019s scratches, a half a century\u2019s worth. Marie had escaped through a window while the nurse was calling child services.\nMarie smoothes her nightie down over the wound. Maybe as the Hammond\u2019s daughter, she\u2019ll get to go back to school for a while. They\u2019ll be better prepared for questions from nosy nurses: Nell telling them that Marie went through a window in the accident that killed her parents. Funny. After tomorrow, Nell may as well be dead because Marie will never see her again. Does Marie feel sad? She doesn\u2019t know.\nStanding, Marie lifts her Piglet duvet and climbs into bed, pulling her nightie down when it rides up. She can barely remember the time when she called Nell Mum, before Nell got too old and became Marie\u2019s grandmother instead. It was so long ago. She vaguely remembers clinging to a young woman\u2019s hand, the whispered stories and soft lullabies. She remembers her mother caressing her hair in the night, stroking it gently from her face. Marie used to love her mother.\nNell\u2019s bladder is full. She tries to ignore it, but eventually the urgency becomes too much. She gets up, puts on her dressing gown and slippers, and shuffles to the toilet. She hasn\u2019t been there long when Marie gives a little squeal.\nSuddenly, she\u2019s pounding on the toilet door.\n\u201cNell!\u201d Marie shouts. She bangs hard on the plywood. Screeching. The neighbours will complain. Then Nell remembers that today is Wednesday. Ah, that explains it. Her baby is impatient to leave. Full of excitement, she wants to be gone from here, across town with her new mother. After everything, Nell can hardly blame her. Her heart breaking, Nell pulls up her pyjama pants and re-ties her dressing gown.\n\u201cNell!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d\nNell pulls open the door. Dressed in her pink Tinkerbell nightie, Marie is standing in the hall. Her face is contorted in fury. Ugly. Hard.\n\u201cYou stupid bitch,\u201d Marie screams. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t fucking help yourself, could you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, love? What have I done?\u201d Nell is taken aback. What\u2019s upset her now? Marie\u2019s going today. It\u2019s what she\u2019s wanted, what they\u2019ve planned. Nell sighs. Sometimes there\u2019s no pleasing the girl.\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, hurry up!\u201d Marie turns on her heel stalks into Nell\u2019s room. Nell follows her, scuffing in her slippers. \u201cThere!\u201d Marie spits, pointing at the bed.\nIt\u2019s Marie, not more than a year old. There are six of them.\nNaked in the cool air of the morning, the babies writhe, shaking their chubby little fists at the ceiling, their faces twisted in frustration. Horrified, Nell clutches the door frame.\n\u201cYou stupid bitch,\u201d Marie says again.\nNell looks at her daughter. She\u2019s put a sweatshirt on over her nightie and is carrying her little suitcase. Too heavy for her, Marie has to use two hands. The suitcase bangs against her legs.\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m staying to help, you\u2019re wrong. You wished my life away, and now you have to live with it,\u201d says Marie. \u201cAgain.\u201d She turns away.\nNell sinks to the floor as the front door slams. Her little girl has gone. Nell imagines Marie lugging her suitcase onto the bus, the hiss as the doors close.\nThe babies start to shriek.\nLee Murray writes fiction for adults and children.

She cleared her throat. \u201cHi guys.\u201d\nShe ran her hand through her hair, tousled it. She shifted in her chair and sat up straight.\n\u201cHi guys.\u201d\nJaime closed her eyes and tried to visualize the faces of her audience: the teenage girls, the gay boys, the sweet parents who watched with their babies, all manners of tender-hearted people from all corners of the country. The one boy who had tweeted from Glasgow. The girl from Thailand who had called her an inspiration. Jaime took a deep breath and spoke again.\n\u201cHi guys,\u201d she gushed to the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Jaime. Thank you so much for all the comments on my last video. You\u2019re all super sweet and I\u2019m like, the luckiest vlogger.\u201d\nShe paused, thinking she might edit that last part out. And the pause, of course. Keep it a tight two-to-four minutes.\n\u201cYou guys asked some great questions on the last video and I wanted to take a minute to respond to them,\u201d she looked on her phone where she had the comments thread open. She coughed, waggled her tongue nervously, then went on: \u201cJaime, I love your cover songs so much, do you plan on posting any original songs? That\u2019s from pennylane396. Thank you so much, pennylane! I have written some lyrics, but I haven\u2019t actually sat down and put them to music in like \u2013 years. But if you all really want to hear them, I\u2019ll definitely think about it!\u201d\nThere was another pause, longer this time, to scroll through the comment thread looking for the next question. Past dozens of messages bragging to be first!, making the claim that this is my FAVORITE SONG, telling her you\u2019re so cute! and ur voice is soooooo good!!.\nOf course, there were always mean-spirited and downright cruel messages.\nThis girl is gross ugly as sin and FAT! stop eating\nMost of these were voted down or flagged as spam by the time Jaime got into the thread, but a few sneaked past. And there were always plenty of mean comments masquerading as friendly comments: You could be famous if you lost some weight and wrote your own stuff, or, I really like ur videos but I\u2019d share them more if you tried to lose weight? I think it sends a bad message.\nCommenters constantly got into big arguments about Jaime\u2019s weight. Invariably, someone would invoke the names of Aretha and Adele, the alpha and the omega. Jaime didn\u2019t have a power-house soul voice, though. She had the honey-sweet voice and just enough guitar know-how for the quieter indie and folk songs, delicate songs that were sung by skinny-limbed women like Ani DiFranco, Tracy Chapman, Tori Amos. No one ever mentioned Cass Elliot when defending Jaime, though she was a slightly closer musical equivalent. Jaime wasn\u2019t sure if this was because no one her age or younger had really heard of her, or if her name still summoned too many fat jokes to the mind. She died choking on a ham sandwich, and all that. She hadn\u2019t, of course \u2013 Mama Cass had been fasting four days a week when she died of cardiac arrest.\nJaime had tried to lose weight. She had tried very, very hard for seven straight years, between the ages of eleven and eighteen. At age twenty-six, her parents still called weekly and asked if she was trying to lose weight, even though they had watched the efforts that had ebbed away the energy of her teenage years and robbed her of peace. Jaime gave herself permission to lie to them.\nHer parents also asked her if she had a boyfriend, and they asked about how her day job was, and they told her funny stories about her brother\u2019s children. She only knew the kids \u2013 two and four years old \u2013 through photos, videos, and phone calls. She had moved to Chicago from South Carolina shortly after the eldest was born. She sent them birthday presents and they sent her Christmas photo-cards. Jaime wanted to know them, but more than that, she wanted to put at least five years between herself and South Carolina. She didn\u2019t know how to talk to kids, anyway. She just talked to them like they were adults and everyone laughed at her like she was being nutty on purpose.\n\u201cThe next question is from zombiefever \u2013 cool name!\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cZombiefever asked: what is your favorite song? That\u2019s really hard. It changes a lot. \u2026Uh, I think my favorite song, uh. I think my favorite song changes a lot, but my favorite song right now? If you\u2019ve been watching for a long time you know I\u2019m a big fan of Regina Spektor, and right now I\u2019m really into this song of hers, \u2018That Time\u2019. If you haven\u2019t heard it, you should check it out. Oh, and I\u2019ll put a link to the music video in the description down-below.\u201d\nShe smiled and kept scrolling. It always felt good to be able to link to something else. Maybe she could look up the music for that song and do a cover, maybe classify it as a response \u2013 it might be recommended for fans of the music video and pick up a few extra hits. She grabbed a pen from her desk and removed the cap with her teeth. She jotted down the title on an ever-expanding list. She settled back into the frame of the shot, checked the camera, and went back to comment-scanning.\n\u201cThis is from sufjanfan7, sufjanfan7 asked can you tell us about your guitar and where you got it! Great question. If you\u2019re a musician yourself or\u2026 ok. Wait.\u201d\nShe realized she should have her guitar, Betsy, in the shot with her. She got up. Her camera recorded the empty space until she sat back down with the guitar on her lap. She made a mental note to hit pause the next time she had to get up; it would make editing smoother. She flexed her face and stuck out her tongue again, wanting to get through this spiel in one take.\n\u201cWhere was I,\u201d Jaime said. \u201cYes. Starting over. Ok. Ok\u2026 Great question! If you\u2019re a musician, or if you know a lot about guitars, you\u2019ve probably noticed that my guitar, Betsy, isn\u2019t your standard acoustic guitar.\u201d\nShe ran her hands over the parts as she talked about them \u201cHer body has a slightly different shape, more of an hourglass I guess? Her fret board is wider, and her strings are nylon. It\u2019s a classical guitar, and it\u2019s a little easier to play, but the biggest difference is the sound. Nylon strings are softer than typical guitar strings, which are metal, so she gives kind of, a mellower sound? She doesn\u2019t get as twangy as an acoustic guitar can get.\u201d\nJaime gave herself a break to breathe and collect her thoughts. \u201cBetsy was my first guitar, I got her from my grandmother \u2013 it used to be hers, so Betsy is older than me, and probably older than you. And that\u2019s where the name comes from. Uh. My grandma, yeah. Hm, uh\u2026 Betsy was my first guitar. It was a hand-me-down \u2013 used to be my grandmother\u2019s, so I named it after her. I\u2019ve tried guitars with metal strings, but I learned one\u2026. No, ok. Shit. Uh. Ok\u2026. I\u2019ve tried other guitars, but I learned how to play on this one, and if anything ever happened to Betsy, I\u2019d probably get another classical guitar. I really like them. Ok.\u201d\nShe paused the camera and got up to put Betsy away. It would be a pain to edit that ramble into a short normal-sounding statement. She sat back down, read the next question and started answering before realizing she wasn\u2019t recording yet. She cursed to herself and started over, camera rolling.\n\u201cThe last question for today is from kirstenthenerdgirl. She asked two questions \u2013 do you ever play shows and what do you do for a day job? Well, Kirsten, the only shows I\u2019ve played so far are here on the internet. Since that hasn\u2019t been very lucrative, I also work in retail management.\u201d She gave a big, goofy grin with a thumbs up, then an exaggerated cutesy frown with a thumbs down. She changed position in her seat again and tousled her hair once more for the last shot.\n\u201cOk, that\u2019s it for q-and-a today! Remember to subscribe to my channel, mejaime, because I\u2019ll be back later this week with a new song video. You guys are so great \u2013 thanks for watching!\u201d\nShe turned the camera off and sat back in her seat. It would still take an hour or two to edit and post, but she always felt when she finished filming as if she had already released that bit of herself onto the internet. She waited for the nervous feeling in her stomach to subside, then went to the kitchenette to make dinner for herself.\nThe video was finished in about an hour \u2013 not bad, comparatively. Maybe she was getting better at the editing end of this. When she logged in to upload the finished product, a bright red bubble alerted her to one new private message. It was from a user named fifthartifact. She opened it and quickly recognized it as a hastily-written hate screed.\nshut your ugly mouth you fat ugly bitch you are disgusting i can\u2019t believe you have so many videos. are you looking for some pervert willing to fuck you because its NOT going to happen. log off the internet and DIE.\nCheers,\nf.\nThe insults hurt, but they weren\u2019t new. Jaime thought the most notable part was that he (it was usually a he) had included the pseudo-friendly sign-off. She clicked over to his channel and found he hadn\u2019t uploaded anything, just favorited a lot of viral videos and classic rock songs. She rolled her eyes, deleted the message, and completed the upload. Four first! comments appeared almost immediately.\nThe next morning, Jaime woke up with a pain in her upper back. It was a strange ache \u2013 not a pulled muscle, more like something poking against her. It itched a little, too.\nShe got out of bed, slid into her slippers and shuffled to the bathroom. While brushing her teeth, she tried to reach the spot on her back. She felt a bump there and tensed up. She rinsed and spit and took off her shirt, terrified that she was going to see a tick there, or maybe even a bedbug. She loathed parasites. During childhood she had sometimes lain awake with the terrifying image of bedbugs crawling around under her covers.\nShe located the spot again with her fingers and twisted around until she could see it clearly. No bugs, just a flesh-colored lump. It wasn\u2019t soft like a zit or a mosquito bite. It was hard, like a cyst, or\u2026 Jaime had googled hard lump on shoulder before, and she knew the results were not good. The last time it was just a swollen lymph node, the byproduct of a vaccination. There was no recent vaccination this time, and it was near her shoulder blade instead of her collarbone. Were there lymph nodes there, too? What else might make them swell?\nShe put her shirt back on and continued getting ready for work. She was too nervous to pick up the phone and make a doctor\u2019s appointment just yet, but promised herself to keep an eye on this new lump.\nShe got home that night, tired and frazzled from an argument with a customer. It was the sort of shopper who was very demanding but very resistant to help at the same time. Her central question was itself a trap: Why don\u2019t you carry any of the high-quality soaps anymore? If Jaime had said they were discontinued, she would be agreeing that their soaps were low-quality. If she had said their current soaps were of the highest quality, Jaime would be seen as disagreeable, or worse, a liar. Instead, she asked the woman if she had any particular product in mind, but she didn\u2019t. She asked if she was looking for a particular feature \u2013 exfoliating, moisturizing, warming, aromatherapy? The woman gave a dismissive no before asking, Why did you change the soaps? Who decided to stop carrying my old soaps? She offered to take her through the new products to find one that was right for her, and the woman had rolled her eyes and in an exasperated voice asked, Please, don\u2019t do that. There was nothing Jaime could do that wouldn\u2019t be seen as proof of her incompetence.\nJaime threw her purse by the door, slid the chain lock and the dead bolt into place and headed straight to her bed. She laid there for a while, pulled between the desire to take a nap and the obligation to finish a new video. If she didn\u2019t post at least three a week, subscriptions slowed to a halt fast. If she napped, she also ran the risk of sleeping too long or not long enough and waking up in a funk that might not subside until three in the morning. She let out a disgruntled cry and rolled onto her back. The pain was still there, and spreading. Jaime sat up and went to the bathroom mirror.\nShe pulled her sweater off and looked at her right shoulder. The bump was still there, and a little more prominent now. She turned to look at her left shoulder, and there was another in the very same spot. She was concerned, but a little relieved. She thought that cancer probably didn\u2019t spread this symmetrically. Lymph nodes were probably symmetrical, though. Maybe it was some kind of infection \u2013 she vaguely recalled some biology class trivia about lymph nodes and infection. She put her sweater back on and went to set up her camera.\nShe looked over her list of song possibilities and picked a Dolly Parton cover, \u201cJolene\u201d. She already knew most of the words and the chords, so it was an easy choice for a hard day. She practiced once or twice without recording, then cooked up some macaroni and cheese for dinner. She got a text message inviting her to hit a bar with Kayla. She politely declined, citing tiredness. Kayla knew that Jaime was an \u201caspiring musician\u201d with some online fans, but Jaime was always too embarrassed to let her know exactly how much time she devoted to this aspiration. None of her friends had the link to mejaime\u2019s videos. The only person in Chicago she had even told about it was Amir. Amir was into comic books and old monster movies; he was a nerd in the worst, most earnest and unguarded way. After the bar one night, everybody crashed at his place and found out he was sculpting a clay sea monster to star in a Godzilla tribute film of his own. Kayla and their other friends teased him relentlessly for months. Jaime tried to ask him more about it, but Amir wouldn\u2019t trust that she wasn\u2019t just making fun of him until Jaime told him about her secret internet life.\nJaime hit record and played the song through twice \u2013 once at Dolly Parton\u2019s speed, and once slowed down a little. She stopped the tape and watched them back. They were both good, but the slowed-down version was more distinct, and would be easier to add flourishes to. She turned on her makeshift lighting \u2013 a desk lamp with an adjustable head \u2013 and started playing again. After a brief misstep, she got all the way through the song and uploaded it. She put on her big white headphones and listened to the playback while recording some harmonies and flourishes. She smiled straight into the camera, which she would use for her last shot \u2013 her eyes were usually closed when she was singing. Then she filmed a brief intro, admitting to the audience that she had a rough day and this cover, while not very original, was the perfect fit.\nShe got into editing, but by midnight she still wasn\u2019t happy with it. She thought about turning the camera back on and re-doing some the harmonies, maybe with the tambourine her brother had sent her for her birthday last year, but she was too tired. She hit save and headed to bed.\nThe tambourine was tragically under-utilized in her videos, considering it was probably the nicest present her brother or anyone in her immediate family had ever got for her. She changed and got into bed, wrapping herself in an old multicolored quilt. It was from her family, too, though she couldn\u2019t be sure who had made it \u2013 her grandmother, or her great-grandmother, or maybe an aunt. It had been in her mother\u2019s house until it was gifted to Jaime when she went away to college. When they were little, Jaime and her brother would sit on opposite ends of the couch and fight over it. It wasn\u2019t enough to be covering her feet or his, they both wanted to be the only one whose feet touched it.\nOnce, when Jaime was about seven and her brother about ten, he made up a game with the quilt. He told Jaime that they could find out what it felt like to faint by taking turns laying under the blanket until they ran out of air. One person would keep watch to pull the blanket off just as the other went unconscious, so they wouldn\u2019t die. Jaime thought this was a great idea. Her big brother went first, narrating the experience: I feel a little light-headed. I can barely breathe. Ok, I think I\u2019m almost fainting. Jaime, in nervous glee, yanked the blanket off of him. He sat up and told her she pulled it too fast, that she should have waited until he stopped talking. She said she was sorry and laid down on the couch for her own turn. She kept her eyes open under the blanket, looking at the tiny balls of rainbow fuzz in extreme close-up. Ok, I feel a little sleepy. I feel like I might pass out. I can\u2019t breathe. I think I\u2019m going to pass out. I\u2019m almost fainted.\nWhat are you doing? Her mother\u2019s voice startled her. Jaime threw the blanket off and shot up.\nWe were just \u2013 She looked around. Her brother had left the room.\nThe next morning, Jaime rolled over and was filled with dread. The little lumps felt like more than little lumps now. She was afraid to look at them in the mirror, but she ran her hand over her right shoulder and felt it \u2013 definitely bigger than a cyst or a swollen lymph node. Maybe it was a parasite after all, something under her skin. Urban legends about spider eggs surfaced in her mind. She went straight to the computer to look up her doctor\u2019s number.\nIt had been more than a year since her last appointment. She clicked though her bookmarks, hoping she had been smart enough to save the office\u2019s info on her computer instead of a long-lost scrap of paper, but before she could travel away from her homepage, a new message popped into mejaime\u2019s inbox.\nYou think being a fatty is healthy you dumb bitch? FYI if your dumbass commentators are voting me down I will just repost or direct message you or email you \u2013 maybe I will look up your phone number or your address so you can hear how much you digust me for real you fucking pig. Of course if I saw you in real life I might just vomit. Jaime in Chicago look out for the guy on the train vomiting, that\u2019s me.\nHave a nice day :),\nf.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Jaime said out loud. She hit delete and tried to push it out of her mind, but she was too shaken to call her doctor right away. Instead of re-recording the harmonies, she edited the video hastily and posted it. As upsetting as the hate mail was, particularly threats to find her, she had figured out a while ago that these people aren\u2019t actually interested in talking to her or seeing her lose weight or whatever. They just wanted to see her give up. Disappear. She didn\u2019t acknowledge them, as a rule. The only thing that she found that eased the anxiety caused by being mocked and threatened was producing new content, re-affirming her right to exist and make and publish. After the Jolene video was up, Jaime had a glass of water and called to make the appointment.\nIt was two days later that she actually saw her GP, Dr. Pelican. She had picked him when she moved to the city based entirely on the association with a harmless animal. He wasn\u2019t the best doctor she ever had, but he wasn\u2019t the worst. As long as he kept sending her annual appointment reminders, Jaime wasn\u2019t bothered enough to look for someone new. She was on the high table in her undergarments and paper gown when he walked in.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, looking at a chart which may or may not have been related to her complaint. \u201cThe nurse tells me you\u2019ve got a lump you\u2019re worried about?\u201d\nThe bumps had only gotten worse with the passing days. Jaime could feel them changing shape \u2013 becoming longer, more pronounced. They were about the size and shape of two small, identical avocados, half-submerged in her body. Whatever they were, they were not just swelling, they were growing. Jaime nodded at Dr. Pelican.\n\u201cBreast lumps?\u201d he asked, looking up from the chart.\nShe shook her head and referenced vaguely with one hand as she said: \u201cOn my back. One on each shoulder.\u201d\nDr. Pelican shut his mouth and raised his eyebrows. He put down the chart and motioned for Jaime to get down. She hopped onto the floor and turned around. He very delicately \u2013 Jaime thought too delicately to really feel them \u2013 touched her back with both hands. He drew them away and sat down. Jaime faced him again and leaned against the high table.\n\u201cWell, it could certainly be lipoma, or cysts.\u201d\n\u201cLipoma?\u201d Jaime asked. That sounded like cancer.\n\u201cFatty tumor,\u201d Dr. Pelican said, then rushed to assure her. \u201cBenign, completely benign.\u201d\nHis eyes flitted back and forth between Jaime\u2019s shoulders, as if he was looking through her, at the lumps.\n\u201cDo you know if anyone in your family has had anything like this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jaime said.\n\u201cWell, ask around,\u201d Dr. Pelican said with surprising finality. He stood to leave.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve grown a lot,\u201d Jaime said quickly, \u201cI didn\u2019t have them last week, and now they\u2019re huge. They\u2019ve changed shape. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before.\u201d\nDr. Pelican gave an unconvincing fake-sympathy face. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something to keep an eye on. If they start to hurt, come back to me.\u201d\n\u201cThey hurt sometimes,\u201d Jaime said. \u201cI mean, in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cThat might just be from sleeping on them wrong,\u201d he said with a smile and a tilt his head. Then he got more serious. \u201cYou know, it could be cysts. They can develop for a lot of reasons, one of which being clothes that are too tight. You haven\u2019t lost any weight since the last time I saw you, hmm?\u201d\nJaime said nothing. Dr. Pelican shrugged and smiled again.\n\u201cJust something to think about. You should lose some weight in any case.\u201d\nHe left the room. Jaime changed into her own clothes and spent the whole ride home rehearsing lyrics so she wouldn\u2019t cry.\nWhen she arrived home, she went to the bathroom, removed her shirt and looked at the lumps in the mirror again. They didn\u2019t look quite as big anymore, and she felt stupid for wasting her time with the appointment. She should have known the advice would boil down to lose weight. She could have gone in with bloody stumps for fingers and Dr. Pelican would end the appointment by telling her to lose weight.\nShe had edited and uploaded a new video that morning \u2013 a cover of Florence and the Machine \u2013 and went to the computer to check on the response. There was a new message from fifthartifact.\nGreat video great song Jaime too bad it came out of your ugly whore mouth. Your voice is nice in my ears but you make my eyes bleed. Stop making videos until you are bearable to look at you disgusting piece of shit. Stop eating so muh or maybe you haven\u2019t found the right motivation? I will kill you\nTruly,\nf.\nJaime went to fifthartifact\u2019s profile and reported his account, then took a screenshot of the message and emailed it to a site admin. She also copied it into a new folder on her desktop, police, just in case. She sat in the middle of her bed, staring at the walls. She tried to focus on stories she had read about people who lived in fear of their online stalkers, only to find out it was a twelve year old who thought it was funny. He hadn\u2019t indicated that he knew anything about her, except her first name and the city she lived in. She was slightly comforted by the thought that there were probably ten thousand people named Jaime in Chicago.\nShe held her knees and looked down at her hands. She resisted the urge to rock back and forth, or to ball and relax her fists over and over. She tried instead to be perfectly still.\nShe fidgeted a lot as a kid. Her parents told her once that if she kept rocking in her chair, eventually she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop and would have to be taken out of school. Her brother would grab her hands or her legs or her shoulders to try to keep them still. Jaime started shutting herself in her bedroom closet until it subsided. She would rock and make fists and make tiny squeaky noises. She would look at her hands, balling and stretching her fingers until they seemed like something separate from her. She would whisper over and over, I\u2019m Jaime. I\u2019m Jaime. I\u2019m me. These hands aren\u2019t me. I\u2019m me. I\u2019m Jaime. These hands aren\u2019t me. I\u2019m Jaime. I\u2019m me.\nShe didn\u2019t record anything, or call her parents to ask them if they had a history of lipoma, or make dinner for herself. When she felt still enough inside, she stretched her stiff limbs, went to the bathroom to brush her teeth, then went to bed early.\nWhen she woke up, Jaime felt something was off. There was a sensation she couldn\u2019t quite understand \u2013 uncomfortable, but not a pain or an itch. It was on her back, around the lumps. She went to the mirror. The lumps had changed more than ever \u2013 staying the same size, but growing out, away from her back. They were the very shape of wings.\nJaime paced the apartment. These were not fatty tumors or a cyst, or cancer. These were sideshow-freak-style brand new bizarro body parts. Maybe not, she thought \u2013 maybe they were going to fall off soon and this was them detaching themselves, like a cell splitting. She went back to the mirror. She lifted her left arm and the fleshy left wing spread. It was firmly attached \u2013 it had bones, circulation. It was not thin like a bat wing. It was a stumpy, naked, disgusting bird wing. Jaime thought she was going to vomit. She called into work and told them she wasn\u2019t feeling well.\nThe wings were still there the next day, and the first hint of feathers had sprouted. Tiny black needles poking through the flesh. Jaime tried to touch them, thinking maybe she could pull them out, but she was so disgusted by the act that she started crying. She didn\u2019t want to go back to her doctor, or any doctor. What if they cut them off, cut her open to find out how this had happened? She thought of all the questions they would ask that she had no way to answer. She tried searching the internet for this kind of phenomenon with no luck. Some people had tails, but they were born with those. She was a true mutant, a science fiction. She couldn\u2019t afford to call out of work again, so she wore heavy layers and spent the whole day willing it to end.\nShe had nightmares of being awake on an operating table. Men she couldn\u2019t see were cutting into her, pulling something out of her. In the morning, she found a new message in her inbox from f. His old account was suspended, but the new one was easy to spot \u2013 sixthartifact.\nHi bitch, wow you are stupid. I know you reported me. Did that make your feefees feel better? You are a dumb one and you are not getting the message. You can\u2019t silence me. I have a lot of free time and I know what I\u2019m doing I know how to get around whatever you put up or try, I\u2019ve already got you. You\u2019ll figure it out soon haha kill yrself\nBest wishes,\nf.\nThe wild thought occurred to Jaime that f might be behind this, the wings. I\u2019ve already got you, you\u2019ll figure it out soon. She wondered if this could be a curse. She knew curses weren\u2019t real, but growing tiny wings wasn\u2019t real, either. Maybe that was it. The wings weren\u2019t real, but f knew how to make people crazy. Maybe he had found her and drugged her and she was having an extended hallucination.\nThe feathers were gaining some softness, making the wings less horrific than they had been the day before. They were the same size, and Jaime wondered if they would ever get any bigger \u2013 if someday she would fly, or if she would be stuck with these ugly, useless stubs. She got dressed, carefully selecting something thick enough to obscure the wings. She briefly considered vlogging about it, asking if any of her followers were doctors or \u2013 she didn\u2019t know who to talk to this about \u2013 an occultist? But she was sure that even her most supportive viewers would think it was a joke or a hoax. She thought about calling Amir, but he was probably at work. What help would he be? He\u2019d probably just tell her to see a doctor.\nMaybe not. Maybe he would joke that she was a superhero now. Maybe he\u2019d show her his wings, too. Maybe this was a rare but normal thing that no one ever told her about. At the very least, showing Amir would be a confirmation that the wings were real. What if he totally freaked out? Called the police and alerted the media? No, that wasn\u2019t Amir. He didn\u2019t trust cops, and it took a lot to surprise him. This was a lot, though. Jaime sent him a text message \u2013 call me when you can, ok friend?\nShe didn\u2019t have to go into work that day, so she sat with Betsy and finger-picked her nervous thoughts into a more comforting kind of noise.\nAmir still hadn\u2019t answered the text by half past eight that night, so Jaime gave up on the notion of talking to him about it until tomorrow. She went to the kitchen and didn\u2019t find anything meal-worthy. She had barely eaten all day \u2013 or the day before, when she thought about it. She hadn\u2019t noticed how low on essentials she was. After another half-hour of procrastination, she reluctantly got ready to go out.\nThe wings were well-concealed under her heavy winter jacket, but she still found herself constantly adjusting her posture, catching her reflection in dark windows to make sure nothing looked strange. Amir finally called, just as she walked through the doors of the grocery store.\n\u201cHello?\u201d she said. The cashier gave her an odd look, and she retreated back out onto the street.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Amir said. \u201cI just got out of work. Is everything ok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaime said reflexively. \u201cI mean, nobody\u2019s hurt or dead anything.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d Amir said. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just \u2013 I have this problem,\u201d Jaime said. She felt a knot inside her, a ghost in her peripheral vision. Amir was going to freak. \u201cI don\u2019t really know if I can tell you about it over the phone. I\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m safe, it\u2019s just, something I sort of need to show you.\u201d\nThere was a pause on the line. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a thing,\u201d Jaime fumbled.\n\u201cA thing.\u201d Amir repeated with a smile in his voice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thing that,\u201d Jaime let the sentence hang there while she thought. \u201cThat I think is too weird to tell anyone else about. And I want you to come over and tell me how weird it is.\u201d\nAmir laughed. \u201cLike on a scale of one to ten?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d She shivered. \u201cLook, I\u2019m headed into the grocery store, would you be able to come over tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Amir said.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to\u2026 tell anyone that I\u2019m a big freak? Nobody?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how weird your thing is yet,\u201d Amir teased.\n\u201cAmir,\u201d Jaime said. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Amir said, softening. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that, Jaime.\u201d\nShe grabbed some basic stuff \u2013 bread, cheese, peanut butter, rice, garlic \u2013 then headed to the frozen food aisle. It would be nearly ten when she got home, and she was emotionally exhausted. No cooking tonight. She was contemplating the pros and cons of frozen vegetables when two young men rounded the corner and ran smack into her. She stuttered out an apology. Neither of the men offered one in return.\nInstead, the taller of the two said: \u201cEw, that\u2019s so nasty. I just touched that chick\u2019s fat.\u201d\nJaime pretended not to have heard. She was struck, however, by the fact that he didn\u2019t even bother waiting until he was out of earshot. He didn\u2019t care if she heard.\nShe could feel the heat in her face. She stepped away from them and found that her legs were shaky. Jaime felt like she was on tiptoe, like she couldn\u2019t find solid ground under her feet. She wanted to pay for her shit and run out of the store. Run into her room and eat the shit she just bought and play her guitar in front of her camera until she was all voice, no body, all voice and guitar, no hands, no stomach, no legs, no wings, just Jaime. But she didn\u2019t want to look like a freak, so she continued looking intently at the frozen foods. The men were still in the aisle; she could sense their eyes on her.\nJaime felt the tiny wings twitching. At first she thought, maybe I will fly away. Maybe I will turn into a bird and my body will be small and light and my voice will stay sweet and I can fly away from these fucking assholes. She didn\u2019t fly, though, or turn into anything. They just flapped and flapped. She knew that she would never be a bird, and that these would never carry her anywhere. Jaime was just a fat woman with tiny, dark, useless wings.\n\u201cShe looks crazy,\u201d the other guy said. He was lowering his voice, but not enough. \u201cShe\u2019s like, staring at the food.\u201d\nThe wings flapped like mad. Jaime thought she must be crazy if no one could see or hear what was happening. Or maybe she was just imagining them bigger than they actually were.\nShe moved further from the men and closed her eyes. She concentrated, trying to make the flapping stop. She breathed deeply and tapped out a rhythm on her leg with her fingers. The flapping ceased at once, and Jaime found she could tap out the rhythm with her wings, too. For the first time, she could move them. She could feel them like her own hands.\nShe felt the wings rub against her shirt. She felt the feathers brush against her back \u2013 she felt it on her back and on the wing. She could move the wings by thinking. Jaime stretched her wings and felt the muscles connected, the skin, how it all connected. It felt ok.\nThe guys snickered. Jaime whipped around. Her legs stopped trembling and anger roared up in her. How fucking dare this fucking guy act like touching her was his big misfortune?\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d she snapped.\nThe guys gave her a skeptical look and laughed again.\nJaime raised her eyebrows, then shook her head and grabbed a box of chicken fingers out of the freezer. She mumbled to herself: \u201cFucking children.\u201d\n\u201cHey, fuck you lady!\u201d One of the guys shot back. \u201cFuck you, fatass.\u201d\n\u201cDude, dude,\u201d the shorter one was trying to calm his friend down.\n\u201cI know I\u2019m fat,\u201d Jaime said, slamming the freezer door. \u201cDoes pointing it out make you feel good about yourself or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, dyke,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDude. Let it go.\u201d\nJaime walked out of the aisle, to the cashier. She didn\u2019t feel great about the interaction. That guy was probably not going to learn anything, just feel like some fat girl was unjustly persecuting him. But she didn\u2019t feel bad about it, either.\nWhen she got home and locked the door, Jaime grunted. She let out a little cry, a little noise somewhere between desire and relief. She spent the evening making the first noises that came to her tongue. Singing and speaking and squeaking out loud all through dinner and the dishes and TV watching. She let her hands clench and relax. She didn\u2019t record anything. The next video would be late, but that was ok. She only went to her computer to delete the last message from f and report him again.\nThe next morning, in the shower, Jaime touched her wings for the first time since the feathers started coming in. It was still a little creepy, but the feathers were fuller now. The wings were still the same size, and Jaime knew they would stay this way, stay useless.\nShe washed the left wing, then the right. She turned off the warm water, stepped onto the fuzzy bathmat, and carefully stretched the tender new muscles.\nJaime dried off, got dressed, and set up the camera to record a new video. She started up her computer to find her lyrics and saw that she had a new message from a new username, seventhartifact. She deleted it without reading it. She found the lyrics, got Betsy out of her case, and hit record.\n\u201cHey all,\u201d Jaime said. She glanced at the door. She wasn\u2019t sure what time Amir was coming over, but it might be fun to have him on camera. A special guest. Jaime cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m working on a new song, and I want to play it for you.\u201d\nRJ Edwards is a writer and librarian.

If you put your ear close enough to make a seal, the sound is like the inside of a seashell, only more like voices mixed with the slush of murky water. When I stay over at Emma\u2019s, we curl together in their dusty bed amongst debris and soot. I fold into their back so my ear reaches their hip, and I let the murmurs and sighs coming from the pinched carmine skin lull me to sleep.\nEmma and I have been nesting in the abandoned mansion for about six months now and there\u2019s still so much left unexplored. Each night I slip through the rusted gate and smash my way through leggy foliage, hardly making a mark on its growth despite my hefty boots.\nEm meets me at the bottom of the misshapen, water-swollen stairs and we hold hands going up them. We\u2019ve explored most of the first level so far: the library of gutted books, and the kitchen of moulded utensils and meandering vines trailing over bench tops and sneaking into cupboards.\nEm has made their home in the nook of the jammed-up fireplace. The room looks like it was once a parlour (one of many) and the carpets are covered in blackened stains and wide erratic slashes. If I lived here I would probably sleep in the kitchen, making myself a bed of crunchy leaves and rice sacks, so I could be as close to plants as possible without being outdoors.\nBut Em prefers to burrow themselves into small spaces like a hamster. Once, when I was very tipsy, I told them they\u2019d dug themselves right into my heart\u2019s core. The rims of their eyelids became very wet and they gripped my hand even tighter than usual.\nToday is a big day because Em and I have decided to explore the mansion\u2019s second floor. I stash my school bag behind an indoor plant (aka the brittle remains of potted neglect) and Em picks debris out of my hair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always covered in plant life, Kai,\u201d they say with a giggle. \u201cHave you ever thought maybe you are a plant?\u201d\nI laugh with them but trail off, thinking of the brush of leaves I felt on my skin as I cut through the park on my way here. I wonder what it\u2019s like to be a plant.\nSadly my only claim to enchanted fame is the glitter. Forever embedded on my inner right wrist is a nestled collection of silver and blue glitter. My mother, a perfectionist and enthusiast of cleanliness, has tried washcloths, rubbing alcohol and home remedies galore but nothing shifts this tiny trail of glitter trapped in my skin.\nEm reassures me that one day I\u2019ll know why I have it and what it\u2019s for, like one day they\u2019ll know why their scar whispers. I\u2019m not sure I believe them but I guess in the meantime, I have a cute twinkly bracelet I can wear to parties!\nEm is braver than I am, so they take the lead in going up the stairs and test each one with their toe. They never wear shoes, even in a place like this, which is littered with broken glass and any number of unnameable sticky things.\nLast year I thrifted Em an old pair of sneakers \u2013 they were on the footpath outside a neighbour\u2019s house for garbage collection. Red in colour and covered in multi-coloured paint splotches, I thought they were perfect for Em\u2019s feet. But they sit on the mantle of their fireplace bedroom: loved and admired, but never worn.\nEm reaches the top of the staircase, after some near misses with the crumpling wood, which is rotten with termites. They hold out their hand to me and shine their torch to help me find my way. \u201cI know you can do it!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d I whine, stopping for a moment, and glance at Em with what I hope is a pitiful look. \u201cI told you we should\u2019ve bought a packed lunch.\u201d\n\u201cWho says we didn\u2019t?\u201d Em reaches into one of the pockets of their cargo pants and brings out a muesli bar. With renewed enthusiasm, I keep tentatively walking towards them. \u201cI found a bunch of these in one of the kitchen cupboards. Must\u2019ve been left by squatters. It\u2019s only recently passed the Best Before date and hasn\u2019t been eaten by rats. I call that a steal!\u201d\nWith my eyes firmly on the ground, I shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re truly disgusting. But at this moment I\u2019ll eat anything.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d says Em through a mouthful of food.\nAfter finally reaching the second floor, I settle myself on the ground and inhale three muesli bars. When I ease myself up from the dusty floorboards, I have to brush off my navy pleated skirt.\n\u201cI should\u2019ve worn something other than my school uniform,\u201d I say.\n\u201cOr at the very least, not a skirt,\u201d agrees Em. \u201cStill not letting you wear the uniform you want?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd the toilet thing isn\u2019t great either. The principal doesn\u2019t believe in gender neutral toilets.\u201d\nEm reaches for my hand and gives it a squeeze. \u201cJeez, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re magical unicorns. You can\u2019t just \u2018not believe\u2019 in us and hope we\u2019ll go away.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think unicorns are real?\u201d I say. \u201cWith everything we\u2019ve seen \u2026\u201d\nAs if on cue, I hear a spluttering noise ahead of us. The glossy silhouette of Annabelle appears, her filmy feet grazing the surface of the floor like a hand skimming water and making the noise of hot oil crackling on a pan. Sometimes her feet bob below the surface, her calves submerged in the floorboards.\n\u201cDarlings!\u201d she exclaims, her cellophane arms outstretched. \u201cTo what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d\nThe three of us embrace as best we can. Touching her is like slivers of wet fish shifting against your skin. She smells of lavender and champagne.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally exploring the second floor,\u201d I say. I am mesmerized as always by the shininess of her skin and satin slip.\nAnnabelle claps her hands and does a little twirl, her nightie fluttering around her thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re in for a treat then! Shall I show you around or do you want to explore on your own?\u201d\n\u201cHow about some helpful hints?\u201d says Em. \u201cThat way, we have tips from an expert \u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d cheers Annabelle.\n\u201c\u2014 but still get the adrenaline rush of solo exploring.\u201d\nAnnabelle floats closer to us, her hand cupped to her polished glass lips. When she speaks, her voice is hushed. \u201cIn that case, I suggest you turn right. I think that\u2019s where you\u2019ll make a new friend.\u201d\nEm frowns. They fold their arms in front of them, making their baggy green t-shirt billow at their touch. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need any more friends. Kai is the only friend I need!\u201d they declare, looking at me.\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d says Annabelle with a shrug. She launches herself back, rocking on her haunches like a lifebuoy.\n\u201cEm didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d I say, nudging them with my elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re our friend too.\u201d Em nods with vigour, their cheeks flushed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, darlings,\u201d Annabelle says in her singsong voice. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be partying with a sad ghost like me anyway!\u201d\nIt takes us another half hour to console Annabelle and remind her that, in a tumbledown place like this, we\u2019re all friends and we stick together. Once satisfied with the depth of our apology, she glides down to the ground floor, calling out to us, \u201cI\u2019m so elated! I think I\u2019ll frighten some people walking near the front gate to keep the good times rolling!\u201d\nWe find our \u2018new friend\u2019 in a teenager\u2019s bedroom of rotting bed sheets and soft toys caked in dust. A framed photograph sits lavish and large above the vanity unit, amid a display of dried-up perfumes and desert-cracked husks of foundation in jewelled containers.\nEm shines their torch towards the corner of the room and begins rifling through cupboards. My ears are caught by a quiet sobbing. I look up from the vanity to see tears rolling down the cheeks of the person in the photograph. Their hair, braided and piled high, is wobbling as they sob and tears stain their pink high-necked dress.\n\u201cEm!\u201d I shout. \u201cThis photo is crying!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a person, not a photo,\u201d says a faint voice. Their lips are perfectly rouged and quivering.\n\u201cYou can talk?\u201d I say, moving closer. I notice their tears have rolled down their dress and slipped out of the frame, trickling down the wall and onto the floor below.\n\u201cOf course I can talk. If I can cry, I can talk.\u201d The figure in the photo moves their head slightly to the side, avoiding my eyes.\nEm runs over to me with a rainbow slinky dangling in their hand. \u201cThis is the best night ever! Also, this is mine now.\u201d\n\u201cEm, see this giant portrait?\u201d I say, putting a hand on their shoulder to steady myself. \u201cThey talk.\u201d\n\u201cThe person in the photo talks?\u201d\n\u201cYes. And cries.\u201d\n\u201cRight. That\u2019s different.\u201d Em stretches their neck forward and tilts their head. \u201cHi person, I\u2019m Em. Who\u2019re you?\u201d\nAfter a long pause, a small voice mumbles, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nEm and I sit with our backs to the vanity, avoiding eye contact with the person in the photograph. We\u2019re not being rude \u2013 it was at their request. They wished to tell us their story without eyes watching them.\nThrough hushed words and mumbled apologies, they paint us a picture of growing up in the late \u201970s in Queensland. Their family is well-off and they can have almost anything they want. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t want a car or a pony or whatever it is rich kids are expected to buy. They want freedom of expression. They want overalls, bowler hats and chunky ties. Throughout their childhood, their parents spend a good deal of time convincing them of their femininity and of their gendered obligations to the family.\n\u201cAccording to my Mum,\u201d says our new friend, \u201cshort haircuts were for lesbians.\u201d\nEm frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d They roll the slinky back and forth in their hands. \u201cWhat a shitty opinion.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she said overalls made me look like a man.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to be a man?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause and I can hear muffled crying again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I want to be.\u201d\nWe sit for a while in silence. I put my head on Em\u2019s shoulder and whisper in their ear, \u201cWe should help them.\u201d\nThe slinky stops moving and I watch Em\u2019s hand fidget with a hole in their cargo pants as they consider my idea. With a slow out-breath they say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who we were and then we found out. We could help you explore your identity \u2026 if you want?\u201d\nI turn around to see the person with their face shifted towards us and a half-smile on their lips. \u201cI would like that very much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s about midnight by the time we make it to bed. I curl myself into Em\u2019s fireplace bed and hold them against me. When I wake at around 2am, Em\u2019s hand is still tight around mine.\n\u201cHave you slept?\u201d I ask, brushing my thumb lightly against their palm.\nEm sighs and rolls over to face me. \u201cI\u2019m worried we made a promise we can\u2019t keep. What if we can\u2019t help, Kai?\u201d\nI use my thumb to make small circles against their inner wrist. After several minutes, I see their eyelids close and their breathing slow. I push aside Em\u2019s short brown fringe to place a kiss on their forehead. Their hair smells faintly of cinnamon.\n\u201cWe can only do our best,\u201d I say, before folding myself into my favourite sleeping position against their hip. I nestle my ear close to their crinkled scar, feeling instant comfort in the quiet, lilting murmurs. As I fall asleep, I hear a new voice amongst the crowd of incoherent whispers. It begins as a distant lap of waves on the beach, increasing to become a distinct rush: a sharp voice enunciating one word over and over again: \u201cAnnabelle.\u201d\n\u201cI miss food,\u201d groans Annabelle. She sits beside us at the kitchen table looking forlorn while Em deftly chops tomato for our sandwiches. The afternoon light is coasting through the kitchen windows, casting grey shadows shaped by the vines that flourish against the fractured glass and brittle framework.\n\u201cThank you for bringing so many sandwich fixings,\u201d says Em. \u201cYou know I appreciate it.\u201d\nI tug a head of lettuce out of my backpack, along with a jar of pickles. \u201cIt\u2019s what pocket money is for, in my opinion.\u201d\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d says Annabelle dully. In front of her is a tomato, which she traces with the outside of with her index and middle fingers. Her hand looks like wafting smoke or dust caught in a sunbeam. \u201cI adore your company but I was hoping to haunt the neighbours this afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to ask you a question,\u201d I say. \u201cWho is the person in the photograph? The one you suggested we be friends with?\u201d\nAnnabelle hesitates, continuing to contemplate the tomato. \u201cMy cousin,\u201d she says slowly.\nI look at Em for confirmation and they raise their eyebrows. \u201cAnd what\u2019s their deal?\u201d says Em bluntly.\n\u201cThey?\u201d asks Annabelle, her head snapping towards us. \u201cI only have one cousin.\u201d\nEm leans forward in their seat. \u201cThey can be used for just one person.\u201d\n\u201cCan it?\u201d says Annabelle, their eyes wide. \u201cHow strange.\u201d\n\u201cNot strange,\u201d says Em sternly. \u201cJust gender neutral. And when you don\u2019t know someone\u2019s gender, it\u2019s polite to use they pronouns just in case. At least, until the person tells you what they\u2019d prefer.\u201d\nAnnabelle considers this, rocking her head and closing her eyes. \u201cThat makes sense, I suppose.\u201d She opens her eyes and looks at the two of us. \u201cAre you both theys then?\u201d\nEm grins. \u201cI use they, but Kai doesn\u2019t. Kai\u2019s not chosen pronouns yet.\u201d\n\u201cGosh,\u201d says Annabelle, going back to her attempt at picking up the tomato in front of her. \u201cI wish my cousin had been able to make those kinds of choices. I think \u2026 they would\u2019ve been happier.\u201d\n\u201cThey told us their parents wouldn\u2019t even let them experiment with clothing,\u201d I say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d says Annabelle. \u201cNot only clothing, but everything to be honest. My Aunt was very particular about gender roles.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know why your cousin is trapped in that photo?\u201d Em asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s them or an impression of them,\u201d Annabelle says, \u201cbut either way, they were dolled up in an outfit they hated and forced to sit for a photo. I think perhaps my cousin felt so claustrophobic, they got themselves stuck in the photo after they died.\u201d\nAnnabelle pauses, bowing her head towards the table. \u201cThey killed themselves less than three weeks after that portrait was taken.\u201d\nWe sit in silence for some time, the weight of this new information settling in. Out the corner of my eye I see a moth from the night before flounce slowly towards the light arching through the open window.\nLater that afternoon, just as the sun is setting, Em and I make the slow trek up the rickety stairs to the second floor. We walk into the bedroom armed with a variety of potentially helpful items: a butch muscle vest, a pair of frayed shorts and some scissors.\n\u201cHi friend!\u201d I call into the room, keeping my torch low to the ground so as not to startle them. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d\nAnnabelle\u2019s cousin is turned away from us; the back of their elaborate hair looks like the top of a glazed, knotted pastry.\nI try again. \u201cWe have some gifts for you.\u201d\nGradually their head turns and they smile at us. \u201cI like gifts, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought these might help you find your new look,\u201d says Em.\nThe person in the photo tilts their head and frowns. \u201cBut how will you get them to me?\u201d\nI take the vest from Em\u2019s hands and walk towards our friend. \u201cI noticed when you cried yesterday, the tears could leave the photo. I\u2019m hoping the reverse works and I can just pass things to you.\u201d\n\u201cKai is ever the optimist,\u201d pipes up Em.\nI hold the shirt in my right hand and stand on my tiptoes. I wave the item aimlessly at the photo and the person in front of me laughs. I haven\u2019t heard them laugh before and it sounds like a wind chime on a warm day.\n\u201cYour laugh is beautiful,\u201d I tell them.\n\u201cOh!\u201d They smile and blush a little. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s complimented me for a very long time.\u201d\nEm is eventually able to lift me up on their shoulders so I can reach the photograph. They pass me each of the presents and I slowly ease them in. Putting my hand inside the photo feels like the wet suppleness of egg yolks mixed with the grit of sandpaper. I\u2019m hesitant at first, but soon discover it\u2019s just a sensation and it won\u2019t do anything nasty like disintegrate my hand.\nWe turn our backs so our friend can get changed. I hear the slip and rustle of them removing clothes and remember back to the first time I tried on items that actually made me feel like myself.\nIt was a humid summer Sunday. Em and I took two buses to a second hand store in the outer suburbs that boasted a fill-a-bag-for-10-bucks policy and had gender neutral change rooms. We jammed ourselves into one tiny cubicle and tried on everything that appealed to us. There was no limit, except maybe our wallets. It was incredible.\n\u201cI\u2019m done!\u201d\nEm and I turn around to see a very strong smile. The vest fits them well and they\u2019ve let down their hair so it cascades over their shoulders and back.\n\u201cThe scissors are for your hair,\u201d I say. \u201cIn case you want to cut it.\u201d\n\u201cOh! I thought they were to make the top look more distressed.\u201d And with that, they turn around and show us some jagged holes cut into the fabric. \u201cBut I think I\u2019d like to cut my hair too!\u201d\nWe spend a good deal of time looking through video tutorials on my phone and instructing our friend from afar. The end result is a shoulder-length bob and short fringe. The discarded lumps of glossy blond hair are scattered across their back and the vanity table below. Some are even drooping over the photo frame like wilted flowers. Our friend makes a decision to leave their lipstick crimson, and to add some more rips and holes to their new shorts.\nWe make plans for the following day to help them trial some names and pronouns.\n\u201cNeither of them have to be permanent,\u201d I remind them. \u201cYou can cycle through as many names, pronouns and identities as you want.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll be okay?\u201d I ask Em.\nWe\u2019re cuddled up in their bed after a late dinner of leftover sandwiches and squashed chocolate bars, which Em found in the back pocket of their cargo pants.\n\u201cAs much as anyone ever can be,\u201d they respond, wrapping their arm closer around me. \u201cBut at least they have us.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we have each other,\u201d I echo.\n\u201cMaybe one day they\u2019ll even venture out of the photo,\u201d says Em. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\nAfter a pause, I sigh and I turn my head away from Em\u2019s. They squeeze my shoulder. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m weird,\u201d I mumble.\nEm hugs me closer and I can smell their cinnamon aura again as it skirts past my nostrils. \u201cYou are weird. But you can also tell me anything.\u201d\nI hesitate, opening and shutting my mouth a couple of times like a hungry fish. \u201cI guess I\u2019m jealous of you.\u201d\nI hear an incredulous chuckle behind me. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d\n\u201cYour scar spoke to me last night. It helped us today. It made a difference. And my crappy glitter didn\u2019t do a goddamn thing.\u201d\nEm sits up as much as they can in the cramped space. They push me over onto my back so I can see straight into their stern gaze. \u201cNow listen here,\u201d Em says, giving me a little poke in the ribs with their finger. \u201cYou helped today! There\u2019s no way I can contort my body enough to listen to my own scar. That\u2019d required some advanced-level yoga. Plus, you thought to bring along scissors. Genius!\u201d\nI make a grumbling noise to show I don\u2019t believe them, but my skin is slightly flushed.\n\u201cAnd who\u2019s to say your glitter won\u2019t help us next time?\u201d\n\u201cNext time?\u201d\n\u201cOf course there\u2019ll be a next time,\u201d says Em. They ease themselves onto the bed again and coil themselves around me. I can feel their breath against my cheek as they say, \u201cWe have to keep helping our new friend. And who\u2019s to say there aren\u2019t other trapped souls in other pictures in other rooms of this house.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe trapped unicorns?\u201d\nEm giggles. \u201cWhat is it with you and unicorns? But sure, maybe there\u2019s some unicorns in our future that need saving.\u201d\nEm pulls my arm towards them and puts a soft kiss against my glittered wrist. We go to sleep spooning one another and I dream of oatmeal-coloured ponies leaping in the sky through swells of glitter clouds.\nRae White is a non-binary poet, writer and zinester living in Brisbane.

Still waist-deep in the hole he pulled the splinter with his teeth. He sucked on the sore thumb for a moment.\nSomewhere deeper in the structure someone shouted.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d a cello said. Rosewood and yew, it leant back in a stand. Out of tune.\n\u201cQuiet you,\u201d Shev forced his way out onto the floor. Other instruments looked on: a clarinet, a small rack of piccolos, a bassoon with an oboe, a dozen violins on hooks, some violas, and more cellos. At the back, near the gray steel door, stood some timpani and other drums. The room reeked of oil and polish.\nShev was getting tired of these rescues. Twits who had no sense, getting themselves in stupid situations.\nStill, it paid.\nIn the middle, only ten feet from Shev\u2019s ruinous hole, lay the harpsichord. Deep green with an elegantly curved side, the instrument glowered at him. Precise carvings covered the legs. The lid lay closed.\nGood.\n\u201cYou should leave,\u201d the harpsichord said, its voice a crisp plinking sound. The piccolos rattled, like metal birds twittering in a cage.\n\u201cI\u2019ll only be a minute,\u201d Shev said. Long enough to find the elf.\nShev lay his axe on the floor. Surveying the room, he knew some of the instruments would fetch a fine price in the markets in Korbarth or Thettle or Tanglethorn. Or even off-world. A lot of the visiting traders were offering high prices. Especially for the living. Whether instruments or trees or rocks or bicycles.\n\u201cScat,\u201d the double bass told him.\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Shev said. \u201cNow for the drums to tell me to \u2018beat it\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a sense of humor,\u201d the harpsichord said.\n\u201cSure. Open up.\u201d Shev lifted the lid. It squeaked like an old gate. The harpsichord howled.\nAll Shev had to do was find the elf and get out. He heard shouts from below. Something clanked on the door. Like a ring of keys.\nHe didn\u2019t have long.\nFlicking on his flashlight he shone the beam around the interior.\n\u201cOuthara,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on.\u201d Shev whistled to draw the little creature out.\nThe key clicked in the door\u2019s lock. The lock groaned.\n\u201cCome on, little one,\u201d Shev said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d a tiny voice said.\n\u2018Us\u2019? Shev thought.\n\u201cThis is a rescue,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d the harpsichord said. \u201cHe\u2019s a thief.\u201d\n\u201cSteady on.\u201d\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Outhara stepped out onto the strings. He was little more than two inches tall, in a green outfit with black boots. Shev saw a glint of reflection from a tiny wristwatch.\nThe door shuddered. It began moving inward.\n\u201cYou should come now,\u201d Shev said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d the harpsichord said. Several other instruments joined in a chorus of pleading.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Outhara said.\nShev sighed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a thief, but that\u2019s my other job. Today I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d\nThe door swung wide. Two palace guards filled the gap. They wore regular tight-cut blue uniforms, and both carried slasers.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Shev said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a break-in.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t hesitate. One took two steps and stopped. The other marched across the floor. Straight at Shev.\n\u201cHome?\u201d Outhara said.\n\u201cSallow Hills Estate.\u201d Shev stepped left, keeping the instrument between himself and the guard. She was taller than he, heavier too. He wouldn\u2019t last long against her, even without the slaser.\n\u201cBut my family,\u201d Outhara said.\n\u201cFamily?\u201d Shev glanced into the strings. A female elf stepped up to join Outhara. Three half-sized version came with her.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s new,\u201d Shev said.\n\u201cGet him,\u201d the cello said.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t hear you,\u201d Shev said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re being played.\n\u201cWe hear them fine,\u201d the female guard said.\nThe other instruments started calling encouragement like a rabid basketball crowd. De-fense.\nShev sighed. Pick up the elf, that was the job. Not a family. Not with guards could talk to the music.\n\u201cListen,\u201d Shev said, still moving around the harpsichord. He was conscious of putting his back to the guard at the door. Too easy to get slasered that way.\nShev stepped back around the double bass. He picked up the cello by the neck. The instrument groaned. Almost like the door.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your plan?\u201d the guard said.\nShev extended the cello\u2019s spike. He wished he\u2019d kept hold of the axe.\nThe other instruments wailed and screeched. One of the agitated violins fell from its peg, landing with a hollow clunk.\n\u201cThat\u2019s on you,\u201d the guard at the door said.\n\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d Shev said.\n\u201cWe all come,\u201d Outhara said, \u201cor none of us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Shev kept the cello raised. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of these two and I can take you home.\u201d\nThe guard at the door laughed. Shev stepped towards the harpsichord. He kept the spike up. \u201cI\u2019m just retrieving Outhara and his family,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSure,\u201d the guard said. She moved fast. Feinted and batted the cello away. She jabbed.\nThe slaser struck. It felt like every nerve in his body jerked from its root. They all connected back to his pain center.\nShev slammed flat on his back.\nHours later, still shivering from the shock, Shev sat on the hard wooden bench in a stone cell. It was a biocut hollow in the bedrock under the castle. The walls showed shallow, scalloped indentations where the cyber-algae had eaten away at the rock. That was the kind of thing you could do if you were in no particular hurry. The castle was at least five hundred years old.\nShev rubbed his shoulder where the slaser had barbed him. The skin was still tender.\nIn the cell next door someone groaned.\nShev got up and went to his cell\u2019s iron grate door. \u201cBuddy?\u201d he said.\nHe only got more groaning in response.\n\u201cBack away from the door,\u201d a guard growled.\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Shev said. He\u2019d already blown his schedule. And he hadn\u2019t even got the elf.\nElves.\nHow had that happened? A whole family?\n\u201cQuiet down. Feeding time is at feeding time.\u201d\nHours passed before the meal came. \u2018Meal\u2019 being a generous description for the gray, lumpy slop. It smelled rotten. Shev ate it anyway. Never one to turn up a free meal.\nThe groaning next door continued.\nAfter dark Shev picked the lock using his four shoelace aglets. A simple mechanical thing, the lock still took longer than he wanted.\nWhen the door slid open he half-expected alarms to start blaring.\nSilence, but for the groaning. It gave Shev an idea. Working fast he picked the lock on the groaner\u2019s cell door.\nThe man lifted his head from the bunk and looked at Shev with another groan.\n\u201cCome on, Buddy,\u201d Shev said. \u201cI need your help here.\u201d\nMore groans. The guy rolled over and Shev smelled whiskey. He hauled the drunk to his feet \u2013 accompanied by more groaning \u2013 and dragged him through the door.\nThe jail was just six cells, three on a side. Four empty. One end of the gap between was a stone wall, the other a solid steel door.\nShev knew he couldn\u2019t pick that lock. He drew the drunk up in front of himself and rapped on the door. It didn\u2019t make much of a sound.\nThey had some sensors but nothing much in the way of cameras. Imaging tech took its time getting here. And it was still expensive. He wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far in Ajax or Estetar.\nThe door buzzed. It opened slowly outward. As soon as the gap was wide enough, Shev shoved the drunk. The man staggered through.\nExactly as Shev had hoped, the guards \u2013 two of them \u2013grabbed the man. He belched.\nShev sped out. He tripped the first guard. As the man fell, Shev relieved him of his weapon. A little pulse pistol. Shev squeezed the trigger and the other guard went down. Shaking the way Shev had from the slaser.\nThe drunk collapsed on top.\nShev took the other weapon and the guard\u2019s access disk. As he stood, Shev saw five more guards facing him.\nIn a half-circle, they all had their weapons trained on him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to try, right?\u201d\nThey shot the guns from his hands. The weapons clattered to the floor. His hands stung and Shev smelled burning skin\n\u201cAll right. I give up.\u201d\nThe biggest guard came forward and slammed Shev to the floor. Dazed, he felt manacles close over his wrists.\nShev had grown up in old Silester in what had once been the English Channel. The land remained swampy and boggy. Reclaimed for the most part, industrialists excited by the possibility of creating a permanent land link from England to France.\nHe\u2019d first gone off-world when he was seventeen. A month-long posting with a group of marines to Eddgu \u2013 a newly-made world at the expansion edges undergoing colonization.\nIt hadn\u2019t taken him long to figure out space travel wasn\u2019t for him. At twenty-two he\u2019d settled on Cloister, a rustic place that reminded him of Earth. Unwilling to face the multi-leap trip to home, he\u2019d chosen the place that made him least homesick.\nHe couldn\u2019t quite remember how he\u2019d shifted from security to thievery. Perhaps it was a natural transition, his talents lending themselves more to skullduggery than to watching banks of screens for hours on end.\nThe trouble was that he ended up in places like this. It wasn\u2019t his first time in a cell. Might not be his last, either.\n\u201cHey?\u201d a voice said. From the window.\nShev stood and looked. The harpsichord elf. Standing on the stone between the iron bars. The little creature seemed even smaller than before.\n\u201cCan you get us home?\u201d it said, casting nervous glances outside. Dawn creeping up, it was growing light outdoors.\n\u201cIf I can get out of here,\u201d Shev said.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. Least of our troubles.\u201d\nThe elf continued to shrink even after it had freed Shev. It sat on his shoulder as Shev ran through the hallways.\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading back to the music room,\u201d Shev said.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cSo how come you\u2019re getting smaller?\u201d\n\u201cConnection broke. Takes a while to re-establish.\u201d\n\u201cLong?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe a week.\u201d\n\u201cJust from coming to break me out?\u201d\n\u201cYep. I think they\u2019ve found out you\u2019re missing.\u201d\nPuffing already, Shev put on an extra burst of speed. The elf had magicked the locks and put the guard to sleep.\nThat didn\u2019t mean it had the wherewithal to influence the whole castle. What power it did have was diminishing by the moment.\nShev kept running.\n\u201cHow did they get you here?\u201d he said. He knew how he\u2019d planned to get it back: the flyer he had parked at the structure\u2019s moat.\n\u201cIn a harpsichord,\u201d the elf said. \u201cThey trapped me and sealed me in. Bound it up with cables and tape.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Shev said. \u201cSerious.\u201d\n\u201cYou bet.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d\n\u201cUsual story. Prince trying to impress a princess.\u201d\n\u201cSeen that before.\u201d\nShev rounded a corner. Six guards stood shoulder to shoulder across the hallway.\nFacing the other way.\nAs one they turned.\n\u201cOoops,\u201d the elf said.\nShev stopped. He held his hands up. \u201cGuys,\u201d he said. \u201cAll good, huh?\u201d\n\u201cGo left,\u201d the elf whispered. \u201cDoorway.\u201d\nShev saw the gap. He darted through as the guards\u2019 guns took aim.\nA narrow stairway. Shev followed the stairs up.\n\u201cShould have closed the door,\u201d the elf said.\nShev heard thumps from behind. The guards shouted for him to stop.\nTwo floors up, Shev exited the stairway. He came into the room where he\u2019d started. He closed and bolted the door.\n\u201cWe\u2019re right under the music room,\u201d the elf said.\nShev\u2019s ladder had been removed. The hole in the ceiling was still there.\nNo way to reach it.\nSomeone started pounding on the stairway door.\n\u201cThat won\u2019t hold them for long,\u201d the elf said.\n\u201cCan your family come down?\u201d\nThe elf called for them. A strange high-pitched keening sound.\nFollowed by silence. No response.\nShev went to the window to look out. In the distance beyond the city\u2019s margins, the forest rolled to the horizon. It was eighty feet to the ground.\nHe blinked. His flyer was missing. It had been parked in back of the stables.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not calling back,\u201d the elf said.\n\u201cHas someone moved them?\u201d\n\u201cThe harpsichord is still there.\u201d\nFrom outside Shev heard a stuttering sound. An engine.\nHis flyer. It sounded off, misfiring.\nIt shot up from around the side of the structure.\nThe pounding continued. The door began to splinter.\nThe flyer rose up under the window. No one inside. The cockpit\u2019s interior sparkled.\nThe flyer\u2019s door swung open.\nAt the same instant the stairway door exploded into the room.\n\u201cGet in,\u201d the female elf said. She looked tiny, standing on the driver\u2019s seat. Light glistened from the air around her fingertips.\n\u201cStop there,\u201d a guard yelled.\nThe aircar rocked. Powered not by its engine, but by her magic. Riding its engine the vehicle would hover as steady as a rock.\nIt was only three feet away. Shev got into the window ledge.\n\u201cStop there. Get down.\u201d\nEighty feet to the ground.\nShev jumped.\nHe rolled as he landed on the seat. The flyer bucked and dropped.\nHe heard gunfire.\nThe flyer kept dropping. Bullets ricocheted from the bodywork.\nFalling, weightless, Shev shot his hand at the controls. He missed. The aircon blasted him.\nShev tried again.\nThis time he hit the flight controls. The flyer clanked. It stabilized. Gained altitude.\n\u201cWell,\u201d the elf said.\nAnother bullet spanged from the hull.\nShev scrambled around into the driver\u2019s seat. The female elf had climbed up to the dash. Three little elves sat with her.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting weak,\u201d she said. \u201cAway from the instrument.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Shev said. He adjusted the stabilizers and engaged the thrust. The flyer shot ahead over the city and towards the forest.\n\u201cMy husband?\u201d she said.\n\u201cHere.\u201d The elf climbed from the gap between the door and the passenger seat. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\nShev pushed the throttle to the margin. His flyer was faster than anything that might pursue them.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you all home in an hour,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cFrom my whole family,\u201d Outhara leapt up to the dash with the others.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Shev said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without your help.\u201d He smiled. He was used to simpering, witless rescuees. The elf family were more than worth it. \u201cI\u2019ll rescue you anytime.\u201d\nThe pair looked at each other and laughed. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll rescue you too.\u201d\nShev smiled as they left the city behind and sped away over the forest.\nSean Monaghan makes his home in New Zealand where he works as an educator in a busy public library.

Red sand spills through the midwife\u2019s fingers until all that remains is a spine\u2019s length of glass and coagulated blood. This is the town\u2019s first full-term sandified foetus. Soon no pregnancy will escape this planet\u2019s desertification. Soon every child and adult and wretched creature Lottie has brought to this planet will become sand.\nWill she succumb like so many of her machines have, sand seeping into her joints and eroding her processors? Or will she be spared and, once all her humans have crumbled, cross the desert searching for her twins? One of them must have a thriving settlement. Please stars let there exist somewhere on this forsaken world a town stemming the sand\u2019s tide. Even just one town, protected by a Last Ocean Tide partition actually capable.\nLottie leaves the comforting to the would-be parents\u2019 friends and carries away the would-be child\u2019s remains collected in a glass urn. Waiting with horses outside is Nasmefir, and Lottie stifles the urge to clutch hir shoulders, to poke hir hands and stare into hir wide-set, grief-stained eyes to make sure that ze is still flesh. So far, only serious injuries have desertified adults. But Nasmefir is so barely an adult\u2014so small and collecting of bruises\u2014that Lottie cannot help but imagine, constantly, gangrenous silica creeping along this human\u2019s limbs. Hir parent has perished and this struggling town all too soon will follow, but, \u201cI\u2019ll keep hir safe\u201d she had promised.\nZe is still safe when they arrive. Twenty years ago this area was lush bushland flanking the river and people visited often with picnics, wildlife guides and cameras. Now it\u2019s a cemetery for those who cannot be cremated. Enough trees still remain to shade them from the noon sun, but Lottie rarely sees any sign of larger animals here now. After such a mild and wet winter there should be a carpet of wildflowers here, but few of the plants which remain have budded. Within another decade or two desert will have reclaimed this land. Lottie remembers when this place was full of beautiful life, and remembers too when she was full of hope that she could fight the sand, that her twins on less arid continents would save centuries of work.\nWill Lottie bring the entire settlement\u2019s remains here before her arms fail?\n\u201cSullama,\u201d says Lottie as she places the urn next to others. \u201cI am so sorry, Sullama. You would have been loved. You would have been nurtured and treasured and you would have been amazing.\u201d She bows her head and whispers, \u201cAnd you would have known terror for the entirety of your life.\u201d\n\u201cSullama,\u201d says Nasmefir.\nThe next words fail. Hir hands are interlocked, knuckles tight. None of the stillbirths have been easy, but ze has spent so long watching hir parent\u2019s sibling preparing for a second child. Felam and ous partners gambled on a natural birth after desert took the town\u2019s artificial wombs and\u2014well, at least Felam survived. Last year an in vivo pregnancy ended with two piles of sand. Lottie strokes Nasmefir\u2019s shoulder until ze stops shaking.\nSullamalir, first of Last Ocean Tide\u2019s navigators, died amongst stars.\nSullamalir, our space-voyage guide, never reached our land.\nSullama, second of our constellations, sixteen bunched stars.\nSullama, our southern compass, never leaves our skies.\nSullama, second of Felam\u2019s blood, remains amongst stars.\nSullama, our stars\u2019 namesake, you never reached us.\nIt is a shorter elegy than hir usual, but by its end Nasmefir is crying. They had all thought\u2014dared to hope\u2014the foetus was beyond danger. Only a fortnight more and Sullama would have reached them.\nLottie resumes stroking Nasmefir\u2019s shoulder, at first missing the Sullama who never will be then reminiscing about Sullamalir and hir successors\u2014and all the other skeleton crew families who kept her running, who kept her frozen cargo safe during the long journey, who never would have thought that after centuries of travelling to and terraforming a planet lacking axial tilt and microbes their entire life\u2019s work would dissolve into sand in mere decades as if this world\u2019s inertia had a will more powerful than entire ecosystems\u2014when suddenly movement through the trees catches her eye.\nFoxes. Two orange beasts slinking around the world that she terraformed just like their ancestors snuck into and slunk around her hundreds of years ago. At first she\u2019d assumed the ban was an overeager attempt to avoid extinctions in the more fragile biomes she would eventually recreate, but they were doubtlessly the reason everything had gone so wrong. No other genesis ship had had foxes onboard. No other genesis ship had had its world start rapidly un-terraforming itself. Couldn\u2019t the beasts at least have the decency to let her town and responsibilities dissipate in peace.\n\u201cL-Lottie?\u201d\nHer hand on Nasmefir\u2019s shoulder has curled from comforting to sharp. She loosens her grip and unclenches her jaw. Lottie has long wanted to journey up river and search for the fox burrows, but lately she\u2019s figured the desert might take some of them before her humans. As long as they leave her alone then she is far too busy to care about them. Yet here two of them are, scrounging so close. Too close.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was\u2026\u201d The foxes have slipped out of sight. Hopefully out of mind too; she has so many worries already, so many catastrophes to delay. \u201cLet\u2019s head back.\u201d\nNasmefir follows her gaze, sees nothing, and takes her hand in hirs. Endothermic synthetic polymer, cold and dry, Lottie\u2019s is the only skin ze can bear to touch. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No one is.\u201d She pulls away, then presses her hands together and bows her head to the collection of urns. Lottie wonders how often her android twins repeat this gesture, this ceremony, this acknowledgement that she has failed not only the humans on this planet but those who journeyed within her and those who created her. \u201cLet\u2019s head back. I\u2019m late checking the pharmacy.\u201d If another machine malfunctions and starts producing sand instead of insulin or oestrogen, which medication will she declare non-essential?\n\u201cAre you late checking you?\u201d\n\u201cYou ran routine diagnostics last week. There was nothing of concern.\u201d Lottie walks back to the horses. It concerns her that didn\u2019t hear the foxes\u2019 footfalls. It concerns her that, despite frequently worrying about this, she cannot decide which medication will be next rationed. Of course she is unable to communicate with her twins or access her databanks, but she doubts any logs from previous genesis ships could help her. None of them had messed up terraforming so badly that their planet decayed and desertification flourished within a single generation.\nNasmefir grabs her hand again. She obediently stops.\n\u201cYou know, Pa told me to look after you.\u201d\n\u201cGeslirata also told you xey\u2019d return within half a year.\u201d\nAromantic like hir parent but less interested in friendships, Nasmefir had always kept close to family and naturally started learning from Geslirata and Felam the skills to maintain the settlement\u2019s machinery, including Lottie. After Geslirata\u2019s departure, Nasmefir left the school ze\u2019d never enjoyed and had begun following Lottie everywhere. The help had been nice, especially since Felam was busy with ous first child, and ze was both a quick study and an attentive repairer, but\u2026\nHir grip tightens. \u201cWhat is the point of learning how to maintain your chassis and components if you won\u2019t let me look after you. You don\u2019t want to bother Felam, okay, yeah. So bother me. Please.\u201d\nCommunication systems failed when Nasmefir was young; out of the entirety of the genesis starship Last Ocean Tide, ze only knows android LOT-E and has always treated her like family. Of course she was programmed to be paternal, but never before has a child she helped raise lost sight of the fact that she is infrastructure. \u201cIn a few years everything you know will be desert and everyone you love will be sand. Don\u2019t waste your time worrying about a defective ship.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is how to stall the desert.\u201d Or how to make Nasmefir happy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just give up!\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is how to stop farmland, infrastructure and foetuses sandifying.\u201d How to stop imagining Nasmefir\u2019s body desiccated.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find something! There has to be something!\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is how to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cUm, excuse me?\u201d\nHow is there, suddenly, someone near them? Someone Lottie did not hear approach. It cannot be Geslirata. Two years ago xey rode off, leading xeir team into the desert to die. There is no chance any of them survived and made it to another settlement, let alone returned to stand before her with a sunburnt, aged face and clothing she does not recognise.\nLottie is shocked but keep hir safe is a directive her unoptimised brain needs mere nanoseconds to engage. Before Nasmefir can take a single step, she has crossed to the fox. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d\n\u201cDen!\u201d The fox grins too widely for Geslirata\u2019s face and clasps their hands over heart. They bounce on the balls of their shoeless feet and send flying long plaits of Geslirata\u2019s dark hair. \u201cOh, it truly is you! What an honour.\u201d\nLottie, ignoring Nasmefir\u2019s spluttering, raises an arm to keep hir from the fox. \u201cYou demean the dead with this stolen facade.\u201d\n\u201cThis was my guest\u2019s gift to me,\u201d says the fox, for a moment furrowing eyebrows and lips in exaggerated indignation, then looking solemn, \u201cto remember xem after xey\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d\nSomething drops within Lottie, a fear and a hope no longer suspended, but her face remains calm. She will not give a fox this satisfaction. Nasmefir, though, has stopped trying to overcome her arm. Now ze hugs it like a shield and in a voice like a cracking dam asks where Pa is.\n\u201cOh, cousin, hello!\u201d Acknowledging Nasmefir for the first time, the fox claps and smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky, you know, getting to spend time with Den.\u201d\n\u201cWh\u2014why do you\u2026look like\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFox,\u201d says Lottie. \u201cRemove that face and return to your holes, or I will rip it off and put you in the ground right here.\u201d\nThe fox\u2019s expression falls and their shoulders slump. \u201cWhy would you say such a thing? I\u2026 I\u2019ve heard so much about you, Den. You kept us so safe for so long. We were born and reborn in space, we never wanted for food, we sang with the stars, we thought you were the most wonderful home, we\u2026\u201d They rub their eyes. \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this new home?\u201d\nNasmefir sniffs.\nThe fox stares at their\u2014Geslirata\u2019s\u2014hands. \u201cWhy are you letting everything die, Den?\u201d\nReminders chime in Lottie\u2019s brain. Dam levels check due next week. Check pharmacy. Update statistics on percentage chickens etc producing\/becoming sand. Taking schoolchildren stargazing in 12 days (weather permitting). Scheduled full shutdown and systems appraisal is 813 days overdue. Have you made Nasmefir feel appreciated today?\nOutside her brain she can hear some honeyeaters, and magpies further away. She remembers when parrots were common in this area. Lottie never had much time for stopping and admiring nature\u2014even before the end of the world started\u2014but she\u2019s always been fond of parrots. Sulphur-crested cockatoos in particular, brought on board by Sullamalir and faithfully bred by Last Ocean Tide\u2019s crews over generations. She longs for those times.\n\u201cIf I could stop this, I would have. My apologies that you stowaways are inconvenienced, but I need to go try and keep some people alive for as many days as I can.\u201d Lottie tries to turn but Nasmefir, staring at the fox, still clings to her. Of course she could drag hir away\u2014no human can best her alloy strength\u2014but she will not risk any harm.\n\u201cOkay, but, do you have time to visit Geslirata?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about an hour\u2019s walk so I understand if you\u2019re too busy right now, but maybe tomorrow? Xey\u2019d really like to see you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cPa\u2019s\u2026alive?\u201d\n\u201cIf Pa is Geslirata then yes!\u201d The fox suddenly gasps. \u201cWait if you call xem \u2018Pa\u2019 then you must be oh my goodness I have heard so much about you!\u201d They start clapping and bouncing again. \u201cFucken nailed that good luck charm this morning didn\u2019t I!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d repeats Lottie. Now everything is weightless, spinning away from her, and she struggles to grasp any single thought or fact.\nDespite appearing a facsimile of an adult human, the fox\u2014Fourly August, ou introduces oumself to Nasmefir, having assumed Lottie already knew\u2014weighs a mere 10 kilograms and sits easily behind Lottie on her horse. She is uneasy with this but refuses to let oum be near Nasmefir. This is all too suspicious\u2014miraculous\u2014and she is not going to let her guard down just because this fox acts like an excited toddler. Two more follow them, at a distance.\nFourly August talks nonstop the entire journey, mostly about Geslirata at Nasmefir\u2019s prompting. Ou rescued xem from the edge of the desert a few weeks ago, sand leaking from xeir feet, and stabilised xeir wounds.\nAs they draw nearer to the fox\u2019s home, Lottie sees more of ous kin: flashes of orange, glimpses of mischief. She also sees more and more wildlife and greenery. An oasis. The last kilometres the three dismount and walk the horses through a eucalypt forest that should not be thriving like this, and Lottie sees more wildflowers than she has for the last three springs.\nHalfway through recounting another of Geslirata\u2019s stories about Nasmefir\u2019s childhood, Fourly August groans and runs to the path\u2019s edge. Half a dead bird lies there, surrounded by vermillion desert sand and wilted flowers. Ou gestures at it. \u201cIf you get injured out there, don\u2019t die in here! Galahs! Ugh!\u201d The fox takes a deep breath to compose oumself and tells Lottie this\u2019ll only take a minute.\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\nin stars\u2019 wake we awoke.\nsing to me, sibling, oh\nin the light years of dark\nwhat dreams did you evoke?\nThe fox\u2019s voice is quiet, empty of the flash-fire rage from moments ago. Ou drops into a crouch, touches the galah\u2019s wings and invasive sand, and continues to sing of the dreams ous sibling recalled. Woods. The trees and grass and prey their grandparents\u2019 grandparents told of. Sharing these woods with stars their metal den passed and spreading these memories through interstellar clouds. Their grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren seeing these woods again.\nAround the fox\u2019s hands, sand subsides. Pink and grey feathers grow. Flesh reforms. Flowers perk up. Grass spreads. As the dreams recalled from the clouds end and Fourly August\u2019s song fades, ou tucks fingers around the galah and slowly stands to reveal that the ground is completely rejuvenated. The sand is all safely within the bird now\u2014isn\u2019t even sand anymore. Nasmefir gasps when the galah twitches and calls out.\nLottie has only seen minor fox magic before, but when communications worked she\u2019d heard rumours of stronger feats. Nothing like this, though. Nothing.\n\u201cWhat a silly bird,\u201d says the fox, and snaps its neck. Ou lifts it up and open ous mouth as if to carry the meat between teeth, and then ou chuckles and continues down the path, returning to ous retelling while fidgeting with the bird\u2019s corpse.\nNo sand remains, as far as Lottie can see. The spot looks as though there has never been any sand there at all. So, one fox is capable of at least this? No wonder this forest is so large and healthy. It is a bitter thought, that vermin stowaways are capable of such things with just their voices and Lottie can\u2019t\u2026anything.\nThey tie the horses to a shady gumtree near a shallow creek, and then it is only a few minutes to the warrens.\nFoxes flock to the three now, no longer keeping a respectable distance. Most of them remain in fox shapes and scurry around yipping, \u201cDen, it\u2019s Den!\u201d but some have human or combined shapes\u2014fox tails and faces on a human body. Some of the human faces resemble her long-dead crew members. Memory mockeries. \u201cSibling, you brought Den!\u201d the foxes cry to the fox with Geslirata\u2019s face, who passes down the dead galah. \u201cCousin, welcome!\u201d the foxes cry to Nasmefir, who searches for a specific face. And \u201cDen!\u201d the foxes cry, running around Lottie and gently touching her legs and jumping away with delighted cheers when acknowledged. She smiles politely and says hello and keeps Nasmefir close. She would put up with much more than this to retrieve Geslirata.\nFourly August finally sends the crowd off and leads ous guests past clusters of wooden structures which vary from simple rain- and sun-shades to small buildings on stilts. Garden beds and trellis vines abound too, and here and there Lottie sees more traditional fox holes in the ground. Potted spider orchids sit on the steps of the wooden room ou brings them to, and beyond them sits Geslirata. Xey wears a clean oversized gown, legs hidden beneath its folds and a blanket. Xeir face is sunburnt like the fox\u2019s facade, xeir hair as long but tied up in a messy bun. Xeir eyes light up.\nThis time Lottie doesn\u2019t stop Nasmefir from running. She\u2019d run too, but she tests that the steps can take her weight before she joins them. Nasmefir and Geslirata, embracing for the first time in over two years, are both crying. Fourly August holds ous hands to ous chest, watching the two and smiling. Lottie supposes that this could be a second fox\u2014with more polished social skills\u2014pretending to be Geslirata, but she cannot see the purpose of such a trick.\nOh. Oh stars, do the others still live?\nShe squats beside the reunited family, offering a pair of handkerchiefs. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d\nGeslirata blows xeir nose. \u201cI\u2019ve got so much to tell you, Lottie. We\u2026 We made it, Lottie.\u201d\nXey summarises, refusing to bother at the moment with too many details despite the others\u2019 interjections. Lottie knows people will start worrying about her and Nasmefir\u2019s protracted absence, knows her reminders and overdue alarms will keep pinging inside her, knows they must be back before dusk lest they risk a horse tripping in the dark. She knows these things, but Geslirata is alive and she is hearing about how not only the next town is doing but a few beyond it. Geslirata has met with Merlot, and Shallot and Blotter. Luckier with geography, the creeping sands have not isolated them fully yet. They\u2019ve had more success with the ocean too, as long as they don\u2019t stray too far from shore\u2019s sight. Several times they\u2019ve attempted reaching Lottie\u2019s settlement but between the reefs, deep water and sandy beaches they can\u2019t safely get near.\nGeslirata is obviously skirting around something in xeir summarising, but before she can ask xey speaks of xeir fellow expedition members: only one died on the way south, three stayed with Merlot, and the two others\u2026\nXey attends to the handkerchief again and Nasmefir bows hir head.\nLottie presses her hands together for the dead, and then she gently touches the living before her. \u201cIt is so good to see you. But tell me the rest when we\u2019re back home!\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Xey, still sniffling, turns to the fox sitting cross-legged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them?\u201d\nOus mouth stretches into a tight frown.\n\u201cTell us what?\u201d asks Nasmefir as Lottie looks from one Geslirata face to the other.\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite recovered yet.\u201d\nGeslirata pulls aside the blanket across xeir legs and Fourly August unwraps the bandages\u2014where did the foxes get those\u2014around xeir feet, revealing blisters and pus. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026trying our best,\u201d ou says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything in the clouds to evoke for this. None of the injuries we saw treated onboard you were to feet. None of the dreams we heard are useful. Saw enough hand injuries that we can keep the sand at bay, keep the wounds from worsening. But it\u2019s not improving either.\u201d\nLottie ponders the vermillion tinge of the blisters. \u201cSo you at some point saw someone put a bird back together?\u201d\n\u201cWe have many memories of observing and destroying birds. Fixing a bird is not difficult to reverse engineer. But human feet? Sans boots?\u201d Fourly August bends a leg to show that ous sole is fox-like. \u201cWe need your help for this, Den. The memories you keep.\u201d\n\u201cThe memories I\u2014I have textbooks and case studies written on a planet where flesh did not turn into sand. I have machines and doctors who can\u2019t treat desertification.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cMemories? Memories of what?\u201d\n\u201cFeet. If you remember feet, you can make feet.\u201d\nLottie does not reply.\n\u201cWhy are you acting like you don\u2019t \u2014\u201d The fox huffs. \u201cThis is why you store memories in starlight where anybody can access them, not in metal disks where you forget just because something breaks. If you evoke memories of feet, you can sing a song of feet\u2014well. Geslirata says you won\u2019t be able to sing, which I don\u2019t understand because you sang the entire planet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I said was Merlot \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sing,\u201d says Lottie.\nFourly August\u2019s mouth opens twice without words, incredulity rolling across ous face, and then ou laughs. \u201cWho do you think we learnt to sing from? You evoked the dreams of your predecessors, you sang the desires of your creators! You recreated the world that they remembered! You\u2026\u201d Ou looks to Geslirata\u2019s feet. \u201cBefore you stopped.\u201d\n\u201cI terraformed.\u201d\n\u201cYes! We watched you! You sang this planet!\u201d\n\u201cI am a piece of equipment that acted according to programming. I didn\u2019t sing or magic anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t convince oum,\u201d says Geslirata. \u201cWe\u2019ve been debating this for a while.\u201d\nLottie taps her fingers. She does not breathe and lacks an articulating diaphragm; she cannot sigh wearily. \u201cEven if I were to indulge this viewpoint, how would I\u2026terraform diseased feet healthy?\u201d\nThe fox, at first copying Lottie\u2019s motions, gesticulates at her. \u201cHow would you\u2014the same as you\u2019d sing anything else!\u201d\n\u201cI. Did not. Sing. Anything.\u201d\nGeslirata covers xeir face with a hand and groans. Holding tight a fold of xeir sleeve, Nasmefir watches Geslirata\u2019s other face animating in ways uncanny as ou and Lottie continue arguing.\n\u201cPa,\u201d ze says softly. \u201cYou remember your feet, right? Can you sing them?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2014the sand affects it, we think? My memories and singing are sandy.\u201d\n\u201cYour singing?\u201d snaps Lottie, her full attention back on Geslirata. \u201cHow can a human do fox magic?\u201d\nFourly August sighs and clutches ous head. \u201cHow is it fox magic if we learnt it from you, Den?\u201d\n\u201cYou did not \u2014\u201d\n\u201cDown south,\u201d xey quickly says, \u201cI saw humans sing with foxes. Merlot, Blotter and Shallot work with foxes. Foxes live within their settlements. Humans and foxes sing the sand into submission, together. Or sign, recite, write it away. They help each other.\u201d Geslirata smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. Androids can\u2019t seem to sing like we can, but you\u2019re excellent memory sources.\u201d\nLast Ocean Tide\u2019s designers had felt it important that, in order to better facilitate ship-crew bonding, her android extensions should emote. As machines, of course, Lottie and her twins can choose their facial displays, body language and voice independent of their feelings. Visible disgust and anger at a being who has saved Geslirata\u2019s life would be too improper, and Lottie is capable of seemingly remaining merely annoyed. But she imagines three of her twins\u2014and how many more?\u2014believing this shit, accepting and trusting these pests. Have they malfunctioned? They should all be identical, a decade of isolation and consistent stress levels well above guidelines notwithstanding. She feels burning bile building up inside, and she scowls.\n\u201cThey are thriving, Lottie. Down south machinery doesn\u2019t fail and injured children don\u2019t die. They don\u2019t let the desert take over their bodies or cropland. No one prays to just make it another year. Instead, Merlot has plans to expand, to rejuvenate more land and reconnect with more settlements.\u201d\nLottie cannot imagine working together with foxes, letting them practice their magic inside her settlement and encouraging them to teach it. But she also cannot imagine doing anything other than spending every day struggling to ensure that as few people as possible die. If\u2026 If foxes could help her too, what would she be able to imagine? If foxes could guarantee that Nasmefir would see another decade, that Felam could have more children of flesh, what would she do?\n\u201cCan anyone learn it?\u201d asks Nasmefir. \u201cCould I? Could I fix your feet? Can I try?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lottie. \u201cLet\u2019s head back, I\u2019m late and it\u2019s getting late.\u201d She has so much to do, and now so much to think about\u2014by herself. Sometimes it feels like only yesterday when her twins\u2019 opinions were merely a satellite\u2019s relay away.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave Pa.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll return tomorrow, with medicine and other things that won\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\n\u201cWaste our time? We watched a bird be reanimated! If that\u2019s possible, what isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d says Lottie, \u201cchecking the pharmacy.\u201d\n\u201cThen go!\u201d says Nasmefir. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you tomorrow.\u201d\nShe remembers\u2014even without access to external databanks she remembers so much\u2014when Geslirata decided to join the expedition in case they met an android in need of repair. She remembers promising she\u2019d keep Nasmefir safe. How can such a promise be fulfilled just because ou is here? Ze will never be safe as long as the sand continues encroaching.\n\u201cNasmefir, let\u2019s head back.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Meffy.\u201d Geslirata pats hir arm. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t sleep well here.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever sleep well,\u201d ze says, \u201cworrying about you.\u201d Ze turns hir head from Geslirata to Lottie. \u201cWorrying about you both.\u201d\nLottie offers her hand. \u201cPlease \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve been half-arsing your maintenance schedule! I know you\u2019ve been conveniently not teaching me some things! I know you\u2019ve been omissions-aren\u2019t-technically-lying about your condition to avoid stressing Felam!\u201d Nasmefir lets go of hir parent and stands; Lottie does not retract her hand. \u201cI know that just because shit\u2019s fucked \u2014\u201d\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d\n\u201cJust because shit\u2019s fucked doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s so fucked that palliative care is the only fucking answer for both us and you! We watched a bird be brought back to life and you don\u2019t care enough to stay half a fucking hour to see if maybe we can help Pa?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care,\u201d says Lottie after a minute\u2019s silence has crowded the hut, her face impassive once more, \u201cabout Felam not worrying ou\u2019s lost another family member?\u201d\nIt is a cheap shot. Nasmefir flinches and looks away. Geslirata\u2019s eyes narrow.\n\u201cShall we head back?\u201d\nHir hands ball into fists several times. \u201cHalf an hour. It\u2019s not even mid-afternoon. Please.\u201d\nLottie is late for so many things today, this month, this century. An additional thirty minutes after today\u2019s series of unexpected detours is realistically meaningless in light of the impending sand which will inexorably smother her duties. Another thirty minutes here, and then Nasmefir will accompany her home where ze will be safe. Thirty minutes, and Lottie can leave and try to think about everything she\u2019s heard.\nShe turns to the fox, who\u2019s shrunk several centimetres and stands against the wall staring warily at the humans, ous fingers squirming and twitching at waist level. Fourly August meets her gaze and smiles with unsure eyebrows. \u201cAh\u2026yes, Den?\u201d\n\u201cIs half an hour sufficient, and will this be safe?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yes?\u201d\nLottie makes her face smile. Some of her twins respect and rely on the foxes. She can continue humouring oum for a little while longer, to get Nasmefir and eventually Geslirata home. Everyone will crumble and everything will collapse, but today she will keep safe her people. \u201cWould you mind teaching Nasmefir how to\u2026sing?\u201d\nOu blinks and then instantly is back to ous chippser self, clapping and distorting ous visage of Geslirata\u2019s face into a wide grin.\nWhile Nasmefir and Fourly August discuss accessing clouds, evoking dreams and singing songs, Lottie speaks further with Geslirata about xeir time away. She watches the lesson taking place just outside\u2014ou is of course an expressive teacher, dancing around and gesticulating wildly\u2014while xey expands on how Merlot has treated the foxes and encouraged humans to learn their magic. Two of the three who stayed with Merlot did so in order to better learn singing, and Geslirata speaks passionately about what xey has seen. About what xey can imagine happening here too.\nLottie understands why xey initially didn\u2019t bring this up. It is still impossible for her. Imagining working together with foxes churns the bile inside of her. So she doesn\u2019t imagine. Stunned from what she\u2019s heard already, she just listens now. Later tonight, once she has checked the pharmacy and assured Felam that she will bring Geslirata home, she will process this data.\n\u201cShallot thinks the terraforming failed because you didn\u2019t do it with the foxes. What you could do was only half-strength.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d There is no conviction in her voice. She watches Fourly August blur and shrink into ous fox shape. Her internal alarm chimes. \u201cTen minutes!\u201d\n\u201cCan you think of another reason why this planet has done what it\u2019s done? Shallot couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nLottie does not want to think. She misses her twins. Her crew. Her ship. Her confidence. \u201cI tried so hard to kill them, you know. I set traps and poison. I cut off oxygen. Yet here we are, earths of foxes on my planet. They were never supposed to be onboard, not even in genetic vials. Too much damage back there, too much risk anywhere new. No cats, no rabbits, and no foxes who gain sapience and steal my ability to terraform.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cCan ze actually do this?\u201d\n\u201cIn a few weeks, sure. Kids get it quickly, but it\u2019s not just the singing. You need to understand the context of it.\u201d\n\u201cZe says ze\u2019s not a kid anymore.\u201d\n\u201cZe\u2019s so tall now. I\u2019ve missed so much.\u201d Geslirata sighs. \u201cHas\u2026 Has ze been well?\u201d\nLottie cannot lie to one of her designated mechanics. \u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026difficult for hir. I \u2014\u201d\nThey are interrupted by Nasmefir and Fourly August re-entering the hut before her countdown has finished. Ou sits beside Geslirata\u2019s feet and gently taps a toe with ous paw.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret! If this fails we can give xem fox feet.\u201d\nXey laughs, but when Nasmefir recoils ou hurriedly assures it was a joke. Once calm, ze kneels before hir parent\u2019s feet and tries to sing them healed.\nLottie watches nothing but frustration happen. Nasmefir tries to sing like Fourly August did earlier, then ze tries to talk, and then ze shouts and cries and slams hir hands on hir knees. To Lottie\u2019s eyes Geslirata\u2019s feet remain unchanged\u2014or is that a little\u2014no, just light shifting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d consoles Geslirata. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to learn.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d consoles Fourly August. \u201cThe memories you need are in the star clouds. Tonight when you dream, evoke them. Tomorrow we shall sing.\u201d\nOu remains in fox shape to guide the two back to the cemetery path and rides on Nasmefir\u2019s horse, talking more with hir about singing. If\u2026 If this is a skill Nasmefir truly can learn, will it be ze who keeps Lottie safe?\nLooking up to see a satellite arcing across the late afternoon sky\u2014a lump of metal useless for over a decade, if it\u2019s even still metal and not sand by now\u2014she wonders about Merlot\u2019s actions and plans. Last Ocean Tide\u2019s actions and plans. Her actions and plans. Lottie is one of 72 androids created from one set of blueprints that share the same programming and memory\u2014or they did, before long-distance communications became impossible and their partitioning permanent. If Merlot, Shallot and Blotter could find reason to do what they have done, to ignore an ancient command given by people who created her faults as well as her strengths\u2026\nPerhaps this is what she is late doing?\nIt\u2019s rare that anyone other than Lottie or Nasmefir visits the cemetery, but today Geslirata, Felam and ous partners join them. Along the way Lottie spots moments of orange.\nShe is still uncomfortable that they live on this planet, that her twins welcomed them, and that she has started to work with them. Many in her settlement voiced discomfort too, but already the improvements brought by the foxes are undeniable. She can\u2019t guess how long it will take before enough land is reclaimed from the desert to ensure safe passage to the southern towns\u2014and maybe even those further away in the north and east\u2014but for now they fix machines which were unfixable, for now they treat injuries which were deadly, for now they rescue farmland and forest and town borders which were lost. For now, Lottie does what was unthinkable, and she does so only because of the foxes. So she smiles and she thanks them, she listens and she reciprocates aid and knowledge where she can. She tries to like the foxes. It helps that most of them aren\u2019t as exuberantly aggravating as Fourly August.\nLottie looks at the vegetation she passes, regenerated thanks to the foxes\u2014thicker now with saplings, trees, shrubs and flowers which weren\u2019t here a month ago, and more inviting to wildlife\u2014and she spots a particular species of deciduous tree which was never here, which should not exist on this continent, and she tries very, very much to like the foxes. A pocket of climate-inappropriate flora is one thing, but she\u2019ll need to speak to them before they create inappropriate fauna they\u2019ve never seen based merely on memories of foxes from another planet who\u2019ve been dead hundreds of years. She hears small animals scampering as the group disturbs them; she hopes they\u2019re marsupials.\nCloser to the cemetery the vegetation is still sparse, but this is the first visit in a long while where Lottie hasn\u2019t noticed deterioration. They tie up the horses and, upon seeing all the urns, Felam chokes back sobs.\n\u201cWe can go back,\u201d offers Nasmefir. Does ze slouch less now that ze has a passion other than trying to ignore hir grief, or has Lottie tried all this time to ignore how much ze\u2019s been an adult?\nFelam shakes ous head. Ous partners hug oum. \u201cNo. Please, Mef.\u201d\nZe nods, wipes hir eyes, and spreads out a blanket. Lottie gives Felam\u2019s hand a gentle squeeze and walks to the row of glass urns. She picks up the one she placed here a month ago, snaps its neck, and pours its contents onto the blanket.\nNasmefir crouches over the urn\u2019s pile to consider it. This time it is Geslirata who touches hir shoulder reassuringly.\nFelam had not allowed Nasmefir to witness the pain of a sandy stillbirth, but ze remembers when ous first child was born. The tiny shape of xem, the splitting wail, xeir wrinkled skin, scrunched face and sprig of hair. As Nasmefir remembers this, ze remembers more, because the others here remember that day too, and they remember other babies, and the midwife present that day and all the other midwives remember yet more birthed babies of flesh and breath. The flesh and what lies beneath it is important\u2014Sullama\u2019s outsides and insides both are sand\u2014and even though Nasmefir has never seen ze remembers, because Lottie remembers textbooks and tragic days, blood and muscles and bones and organs which sit inside a newborn.\nAnd when Nasmefir has evoked sufficient memories, ze touches the red sand and matter-infused glass that should be hir cousin and begins to speak.\nSullama, night-compass: sixteen stars, southern\nSecond-named constellation, nuclear fusion concurrence\nSullama, coincidental proximate incandescence, exists\nat this space in time\u2014our time in space\u2014only\nSullama, second child, you can exist\nonly here, only\nnow\nExist\nGlass ruptures and sand surges beneath hir fingers. Under hir words tissue forms, flesh knits and\u2014oh stars\u2014life kindles.\nSullama takes a breath and begins to cry.\nPenny Stirling edits and embroiders in Western Australia.

In the window, the store had beckoned to her with Stories of the Mental Hospital, old sepia-colored photos on a spread with tiny, barely legible print. An amateur production, crammed full of historical detail garnered with obsession and love. She stared at the open book in the window, and imagined herself holding it. The pages, glossy and quite stiff, turning them slowly, reading with the loupe she had inherited from her grandma. Marcia entered.\nInside, the storekeeper saw her, but stayed behind his small counter. He wasn\u2019t pushy, and she turned this way and that, fondled bindings, even lifted some older books to her nose to smell their breath. There were only two aisles in the small store, and she had come to the end of the first one when it happened. A hairy hand crawled through the gap between two sections (Local History and Lake Seafaring). Marcia jumped a tiny bit inside, before realizing that this was another customer, groping for something in the empty air. She turned the corner, and saw the man in the next aisle. Hairy, still, like his hand. A bear of a man, with soft curly fur escaping from the top buttons of his green and red striped shirt. He hadn\u2019t seen her, and still pawed the air behind the books on his aisle. She stood on tiptoes to see what section the bear was looking through. Another in-between. True Crime and Ghost Stories. Intriguing. Marcia stepped closer to the bear, and turned the other way, to the books on the opposite side. She knew the ways of booksellers, knew how they stacked the stacks when all was full or overflowing. Maybe there was something here, tucked into the open shelf that followed on from Maternal Self Help. Indeed, some books lounged there which didn\u2019t seem part of this label. One could be, she guessed, if the bookseller had a weird sense of humor: Asylum Reared: The True Story of Baby Barbara. Huh. She pulled out the book, and saw that it was the memoir of a woman who lived her first years in Traverse City State Hospital, child of an unwed mother, as likely a reason as many to end up here, in the thick light walls of the institution. She put the book back.\nHer hand brushed against its neighbor, its spine broken and unreadable. She pulled it toward her, angled the dark cover to the light. It was more a pamphlet than a book, a little arty publication. On its cover was a grotesque sight: a gravemarker, small, concrete, just a number in a field of grass. Marcia knew what this was, the conventionalized ways that asylum inhabitants were laid to rest in surrounding fields. Anonymous, easily lost, stumbling blocks for later hikers. The gravemarker on the pamphlet was covered in shrill-colored lichen, pinks and greens and whites pulsating against one another. The title of the publication made her shudder. Bones and Pearls. The Botany of Graves.\nThe bear behind her must have felt the vibration creeping through her body, for he turned now, saw the pamphlet in her hand. He looked up, a stricken cast in his eye.\n\u201cIs this what you are looking for?\u201d Marcia reached the book across, innocently.\n\u201cYes! I\u2019ve been looking for this everywhere. Thank you. I thought you were going to get it yourself.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries, I am just browsing. It\u2019s freaky, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so. Botany of Graves. But it\u2019s also really useful. It was written by someone in my family.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Marcia entered fluidly into the conversation, her eyes wide, knowing her pull and power. She listened as Bear Man explained an uncle\u2019s obsession, his journeys across the Mid-West, sampling graves in old and new graveyards, his experiments in old closed-down asylums like Eloise and Traverse City.\n\u201cThe theory was that some mixture of madness, medication and exposure created mineral-rich bones, a special fertilizer for these lichen.\u201d\nHe had Marcia\u2019s full attention. Yes. Score.\nTwo days later, Bear (real name Scott Mallard) and her were grave-hunting, like the old days. Camera, scraper, chemicals, plastic baggies, and, for afterward, a weed pipe, were safely stored in her backpack. They had sturdy shoes over thick socks, pant legs stuffed into socks to give no purchase to ticks and the irritating little seedheads that held on tight. It was evening time in September, plants pumped full with the thickness of golden late-summer sun. Not as good as spring burst, maybe, but still an excellent harvesting time. They left the car not far from a Dairy Queen, on the edge of its car park, to blend in better with local crowds. From there, they hiked over the field, following the notes in the old history book, looking for the dwindling and hidden grave markers of Eloise\u2019s unfortunates. The ones that didn\u2019t get away. Not that many did. The ones that lay here, forgotten and un-named, apart from some mileage in local art shows and among history enthusiasts who dared to pierce the madness stigma.\nMarcia and Bear got lucky quickly. A straggly row of concrete nobs appeared in the weeds, and yes, there were lichen on some of them. Not Technicolor, quite, but quite lovely in their own right, blooming across the grey grainy surfaces in their botanical lace. When they righted themselves after scraping, they heard a familiar sound: a few rows away, someone else seemed engaged in the same activity. A dark shadow, thin and long, a young man, it seemed, held something on a straight razor, held it up to the dying light. Bear and Marcia averted their eyes. All kinds of folks were looking for a high, and it would not do to become too familiar. Their own meeting had been fortuitous, allowing them to find a companion without the direct involvement of botanical hallucigenics. You never know what someone will see in you.\nAn hour later, and a few phials and plastic baggies filled, they sat in the car park of a diner, a few blocks away from their original spot at the Dairy Queen. This was going to be their first time together, their maiden journey of weed whacking. They had read Bear-ancestor\u2019s slim booklet a few times, and Bear had filled in lacking details. He had lost the book in a house fire a few years back, but remembered his eccentric uncle and his strange experiments.\nBear worked methodically, quite fast for such a big man. He cut the scraped lichen with a razor blade, hatch, cross-hatch, sifting and winnowing. Any lumps were carefully crushed: if they were lichen, they stayed, foreign matter ejected. Cut, cut, cut, sift, sift, sift. Now the matter was powder, greenish in the sodium light of the diner\u2019s evening illumination. Probably greenish in daylight, too: the medium color of the pale crust on the concrete markers. Marcia swallowed spittle, feeling a lump of apprehension behind her chestbone. Bear mixed the powder with an acid from a small glass bottle, carefully drenching, shaking, scraping, turning the paste. It began to bubble. Quick quick onto a metal foil square, lighter, roasting the liquid away. The crust that remained was lighter in color, nearly pure white. Bear turned.\n\u201cFinished. Have a go with me?\u201d\n\u201cShould we both go at the same time? What if it hurts us?\u201d\n\u201cSome lichen? It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Bear laughed, but with a note behind his bark that made Marcia look up. It might be better to go along. He was beginning to get a hint that she wasn\u2019t quite your average meth head\/dope fiend\/inhaler. No need to go there now.\n\u201cOk.\u201d He scraped the light-colored fresh powder into the opening of a small glass pipe. A pretty thing, Murano glass, dots of primary colors smearing around the translucent stem. It was only lightly used: Marcia could see a little bit of dope tar in the inner working. Bear, a good boy. Why was he doing this?\nFinished. He looked at her, wordless. She took the pipe and the lighter from his hands, put the pipe to her mouth, the flame to the top hole, and inhaled.\nA plain in the dusk. Wide open, empty tideland, mud and water till the horizon. There, a thin strip of ocean. She could hear the distant roar of the ocean, and the shallow slushing of water here in the tidal flats. Salt ions in her nose, prickling the top of her ears, the exhilaration of wind. Marcia\u2019s naked feet stepped into the mud, squelching sand exploding geysers between her toes. Then, she heard them coming up behind her, up the gentle rise in her back. Thud, thud, thud. Two runners crested the dune hill, then slapped their feet into the mud. Saw her. Slowed a tiny bit, a hesitation as a question mark.\nMarcia looked at the two runners, skeletons in the evening light. They ran shirtless, and she wasn\u2019t sure if they were men or women. Folds of skin draped over bone, as if all flesh had abandoned them. Hairless, too. Heads like bowling balls, round and unmarked, with four holes in the front, one each at the side. Eyes, nose, mouth and ears as hollow openings into stretched hide over bone. She knew she would see them again, but didn\u2019t know what to do. So she stood, nodded to them, a casual greeting on a sea plain, as if it were ok. They nodded back, picked up their speed again, and continued their sprint over the land.\nThey had been just the advance troops. Marcia knew that. It would be better to have a game plan. She thought about it, and walked back up the gentle rise, landward, found a dry spot to rest and wait. It didn\u2019t take long.\nHe came out of the gathering dusk, melted lilac and blue into the dunescape. A tall, thin man, fully dressed, but also hairless, features in flux. She didn\u2019t look yet, gave him a chance to assemble. He set up station next to her. A box appeared from beneath his jacket. He unscrewed something, and wooden legs spidered out. More screws, some folding, and he had an easel up, a small watercolor paper clipped to the flat surface. A field palette followed, and he dipped his brush in a small water tin, mixed pigments, and stroked bars of light onto the paper. She watched, mesmerized. And every time her head canted toward him, he had taken on more shape. The round head ball had become featured, a strong chin, tall forehead. The skin was pigmented now, a rich chocolate with darker streaks at the temple. The next time she looked, hair had emerged, curly and resilient pepper-and-salt springs. The nose had grown, too, and beautiful, sensuous lips that moved as he laid down color. She looked back at the paper, and the dunes had taken on shape there, too: heather and small twisted trees created by little runs of black water. A seagull, a white streak, angled into the wind.\n\u201cYou look good, little one. I hadn\u2019t expected you to be back.\u201d His voice was as dark as she had remembered it, rolling in his chest like big bells. \u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d\n\u201cI want to find them, Lucius. Can\u2019t you help me again?\u201d\nHe looked down at her, eyes kind but angled up now, measuring. \u201cI don\u2019t know, now. It\u2019s good to let them rest. There are new people.\u201d\nHe nodded to the east, and she could make out new land features. Yes, she knew where she was. Duin en Boosch in the Netherlands, the grounds of a large psychiatric institution, in the beach space, the edges of land and sea. She had researched this place, like so many others, had looked at the treatments, the staff, the philosophy of healing. And there were new people there, populating her vision; where the dunes shifted into scrub of limit forest, she could see hazy shapes, inmates walking slowly.\nHe was whispering now. \u201cThey are long gone, Cherie. Into the line. Over the edge. Let them go.\u201d\nShe bowed over his painting, saw the horizon line on the paper, small filigree patterns of color eating into the white paper as water found its way past dykes and polders. She leaned closer. The line opened. She fell in, his laughter at her back.\nThe line is violet, feathering into red and pink at its outer edges. She is deep in the violet soup, waist deep, sinking. Round objects bob around her, and she reaches to them, tries to hold on. Her hands find one, slimy. It turns. A bowling ball skull. Teeth open wide, wide, her hand slides in, murky and shadowed, and the water turns the skull and the teeth fall.\nShe shrugged up. The pipe was no longer in her hand, and her head rested against the passenger window, damp cold against her pressed cheek. Bear was still out. She could see a sliver of white beneath his closed eyelids, the pipe drooping from his right hand, the lichen remnants now black as the night outside their car.\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d Bear had woken, and they had some black coffee from the diner. He had struggled to wake, but had come to with a choking sound, tears leaking from his eyes. Marcia had averted her eyes, had granted him privacy to get himself together. Now, coffee fumes between them, he is ready to chat. What can she say?\n\u201cIntense. Just colors, and spaces, and drifting.\u201d A very noncommittal answer, good for any drug experience, really. Bear didn\u2019t look happy. The truth creaked between them, the hunger, the need for connection. But none of them spoke up, let the other in. Marcia hovered on the threshold of telling him what she was searching for. But no. Too private, too painful, too weird. And she had no sense of Bear\u2019s agenda yet, either. So they let it go, over coffee, just junk-heads cruising. Till next time.\nThe next time. They were a team now, hooking up every three days or so, driving out to old institutions all over Michigan, scraping and grinding grave lichen into smoke. What they were doing was bizarre, probably dangerous, likely toxic. They knew it, and they each cursed their knotted tongues, tried so hard to speak, but by now, their rhythms had settled into unspoken action. It was even harder to break open.\nThey were in a small graveyard, near Canton, in the Detroit suburbs. The psych unit here had been small, more a private sanatorium than a large state-run institution. But they still had their own graveyard, lists of dead inmates carefully delineated in a crumbly ledger book Marcia had found in a local going-out-of-business pawn-broker\u2019s shop. It had been one lucky find: she had traced the sanatorium\u2019s safe to the broker, and it had stood, unopened, for decades. In the auction of the final sale, she had acquired the safe, about the size of an ancient transistor radio, but heavy. Bear had shown new talents as a safe-cracker, and had listened to the old-fashioned tumblers fall in the cylinder, till the door swung open. The ledger book and a map had been on the top-most shelf, above ancient jewelry and long-silent men\u2019s watches, the spoils of the sanatorium.\nSo here they were, fingering crusty plant lace on top of metal markers.\nThey were not alone. In each abandoned graveyard, they had found other searchers. Marcia remembered the young man with the straight razor, from their first joint search with Bear. He had appeared a few times more. Bear had never reacted to him, and she wasn\u2019t quite sure if that was a threshold, too, a private moment, or if that young guy was real. This time, though, Bear acknowledged his presence.\n\u201cOi. How did you find this place?\u201d\nHe sounded indignant, given all they had gone through to find this site. The slim young man turned slightly toward them, straightened up from stooping over his own set of markers. For the first time, they could see his face. It was pale, and haggard. The side Marcia hadn\u2019t seen before looked sunken even deeper, it looked half-vanished, eaten, as if the bones in his cheek had crumpled like waxed paper, leaving little lines like cuts on the inside of this skin. Bear took a small step back, pulled his shoulders up a little. He nodded to the guy, who kept his silence.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d Bear grumbled half to himself, not looking up again, instead going down to scrape a fat blob of orange lichen into an envelope. \u201cLive and let live, right, girl?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nThat night, they met at his place. Marcia had become accustomed to him now: Bear, Scott, who lived like a poor student and wrote like a fiend. She had never tried to read in the heap of papers that threatened to fall off his desk in his studio, ignoring the mess just as she was ignoring the mess of McDonalds bags and boxes on the kitchen counter. There were no photos anywhere, no hints of family, and she would have been surprised if she had seen any, anyway. Instead of browsing through hints of Bear\u2019s secrets, she sat on his bed, waiting for him to finish the preparation. She had no questions, he didn\u2019t have any demands, and that is why it worked. They just smoked, and slept, and hunted for more.\nTonight, the powder stayed orange for a long time. The blob from the Canton psych unit grave had an aroma all of its own: a minty thing, a blast of freshness that cut through the old burger and onion haze of the studio apartment. She really liked the color, and the smell seemed familiar, unplaceable, but relaxing. She laughed a bit, opened her teeth, and Bear raised an eyebrow. Then they started. A flame. A whoosh. Inhale. First her, then Bear. But the dream wouldn\u2019t come. Instead, Marcia\u2019s mouth opened, and words flowed out.\n\u201cMamma. Daddy. I love you. Don\u2019t leave me. Mamma. Daddy. Mamma. Come back. No. No. No. Mamma. Come back.\u201d\nMarcia was astonished at the sounds that emerged from her, old own voice, years and years back, full of pain and sadness. She recognized herself, crying, heard the voice as if she was seven years again, outside the doors of the institution, reaching thin arms through the barred gate. She blinked, embarrassed, tried to shut up, lifted her hands to shut her mouth. But the show wasn\u2019t over. Closing her eyes meant that what she didn\u2019t want to see again played out on her inner eyelids. Her mother, arms reaching back, mouth askew, calling for her little girl. Her mother, dragged backward by orderlies. Her mother, who danced with butterflies and cried with crocodiles. Her mother, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.\nMarcia tried to cram her words back into her mouth, to keep from spilling the secrets to Bear, her mother\u2019s incarceration, her dad\u2019s earlier withdrawal, the time when he, too, was locked up in a white monstrosity, a different one. But a glimpse over to Bear showed her that she need not bother with the embarrassment. No one would hold her hostage with intensity, would demand her heart from her.\nFor Bear was stock still himself, wide-eyed, not really seeing her, not hearing her baby talk, that sadness of longing in her voice. Then his mouth opened, in turn, and spilled over, staccato tones falling into the evening.\n\u201cI can look after her. Give her back to me. It will be ok. I just needed a break. Please, release her. She is my fianc\u00e9. Yes. Yes. I can take her. No, I do not have her mother\u2019s number. Yes. Yes. I can take her. Please give her to me. Please. Please. Please. Please.\u201d\nMarcia saw tears dripping down Bear\u2019s face, loneliness deep in the folds that ran down from his nose to his open mouth, to the words that spilled out, the magic words that did not do their magic. He was left, all alone, in a different way, by the barred gate, by the concrete marker, by the pills and the electric surge. Now she started crying, too, cried for the first time in Bear\u2019s presence. This, he noticed. His gaze was clear again, as if he could see her and the people he\u2019s talking to, at the same time. Their mouths kept speaking, each separate, then unison, then choral.\n\u201cMamma. Please. Mamma. I can take her. Please.\u201d\nTheir words mingled, overlapped, their words spilled out, one over the other, and they heard them, but couldn\u2019t stop the spillage.\nMarcia and Bear sat in his car. Two heads, looking forward, their mouths pinned shut again, eyes pinched at the outer edges. They hadn\u2019t really decided to go back to the Canton graveyard, but both had grabbed their coats as their mouths just wouldn\u2019t shut, had walked to the car as if in accord, had sat, and Bear had turned the ignition, peeling out in that general direction, then slowing immediately to a crawl. Abeyance. Time to talk. None was up for talking.\nThen they did. Bear spoke, realizing that the barrier was his to take down, his car, his apartment, his space warm and curly opening into vessel. Marcia nodded, didn\u2019t meet his eye, as he told her about Laura, about their meeting, their love, then the withdrawals, the turns, more and more frequent, her need for solitude, his need for her safety, and the joint decision by Laura, Scott and even Laura\u2019s parents to release her into the white walls and locked corridors, just for a while, just as a raft in the drifting world, a respite for Scott, a retreat for Laura. Locks, and suicide checks every fifteen minutes, the clockwork of survival space. The story bottomed out, it seemed, but it had only been a plateau in Bear\u2019s confession. Down it went.\nLaura had turned even further, gone quiet, so quiet, and then the bars had come down for Scott. She hadn\u2019t signed visitation forms for him, no need for that at the time, for her short visit. But then it had looped into months, and the family sent him a letter. They had decided what was best. Which didn\u2019t include Scott. So there. That was thirteen years ago. And that was all he knew. Bear ended, voice gruff, defiant. So there.\nTraffic lights reflected on the wet windows of the car. Go. Do not go. They crawled along, toward the graveyard. Marcia didn\u2019t say much.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to respond, how to make him feel better. \u201cYeah. That sucks.\u201d Maybe that was all that was needed. Bear seemed to hear it, and seemed ok. No tears hanging in the beard. But he wasn\u2019t ready to let it go.\n\u201cSo tell, girl. What is taking you on the search road? Why are you huffing grave weed?\u201d\nMarcia didn\u2019t want to spill. She shrugged. It had been a long time since she put a line through it all, laid it out like pearls on a necklace, this follows that, like a reporter from the front lines. She remembered the plaintive sound of her own voice, mixed with Bear\u2019s howl, and she did not want any of it.\nBear pushed. Wheedled, even, which is why she would never sleep with him. But he was her avenue to the weed, at least for now, with car and knowledge, and he knew it. And he had spilled his, and had heard at least the sound of her voice when crying, even if he hadn\u2019t taken in the words. He didn\u2019t own her, but maybe she did owe him. Marcia weighted the ups and downs, and what it would cost her to tell her story. Ok.\nSame story, really. She told it quickly, quietly, made him catch her voice from the bottom of the car\u2019s footwell.\nShort rest-stops eventually turning into a new home apart from her, first for her mother than her dad. The seduction of seclusion, of dropping everything: that\u2019s how Marcia had made sense of it, for herself, knowing that at least her father had gone willingly, on his own accord. She wasn\u2019t so sure about her mum. Her mum had come back a number of times, sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker. She had dropped bits of her memory at the hospital, weeks zapped out of her brain, but she had smiled kindly again at her little girl, and that was all that really mattered. But then, a month on, or three, she would vanish again, drop from their lives, as if the only way to go was out. Eventually, she was gone behind the bars for good. No visits for kids in the ward.\n\u201cHow long ago?\u201d Bear stayed factual, had not leaned over or touched her. Which earned him points.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my mother for twenty-two years. I do not even know if she is alive. I fell out with my other folks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your dad?\u201d\n\u201cFifteen. He faded out, too, left the world. I could find out more about him, I think, but it was all an aftershock from her. He\u2019s gone. Some come back. Mother had made friends in the hospital, and I still see some of them around when I go and visit the neighborhood.\u201d Marcia kept her other confidantes out of it, her other informers, the ones she only met on the other side of the drug veil, Lucius, others, called up by smack, or, now, much purer and clearer, in the lichen.\n\u201cAnd some do not. I know.\u201d\nThey drove on, picking up some speed, the car shooting through the sparse raindrops. They arrived, parked, started to climb out. Bear reached over to Marcia, stalled her without touching her. He pulled the pipe from beneath his parka. He had some more, white power shimmering into green, with orange grains here and there. Yes, she nodded.\nThey stood in the rain, inhaling, a tang like ruby oranges on their tongues. Then they walked into the old graveyard.\nThey were not alone. Marcia swam through dune sand, ocean\u2019s edge mingling with red clay soils. Grass bent over, looped into the earth, dove away from the concrete markers and their numbers. The round hummocks rustled, stretched upward. Calvarias, skull tops, grew white and grey in the earth. A jaw emerged beneath, stretching open. A left-over dandelion trembled like a tongue in the aperture, then melted into sea weed. Other skulls popped around her, round white mushrooms ready to release their spores. Marcia looked up, at the other figures in the abandoned field.\nRow upon row of people stood, looking down, or scanning the horizon. Silhouettes in the evening light. Some raised their arms to the moon, as if drifting. Marcia looked for faces, but all had melted. Clay in the rain. Like Easter Island statues made out of wet sand. Crumbling noses, yawing eye-sockets. She looked away as a woman\u2019s dress shifted back into flax fibers, weeds in the wind.\nShe could still make out Bear, a row over. His parka had wings now, in the wind that was coming up, stretching his silhouette, opening him up. His form expanded, engulfed some of the other mourners, seekers, and Marcia wasn\u2019t sure anymore where he began and ended. She whispered to him, telling him a last secret about her mother, the secret of love, just a touch of fingers through bars. She doubted he could hear now.\nShe felt Lucius\u2019s hand on her neck.\n\u201cHello little one. You are back.\u201d His voice rolled with the wind, vibrating behind her collarbone.\n\u201cThere are so many, Lucius. So many. Take me to her, please. Please.\u201d\nSand fell down her back, then clumps of earth. Smells arose, musty, then sharper, from damp inland seas to the ozone of the ocean. The elongated shadows around her reached upward, thinning into black bars against the grey land. Then they began to slip away, reaching into the open spaces. Marcia let herself fall backward, into Lucius\u2019s painting. Water cracks.\nPetra Kuppers is a disability culture activist and a community performance artist.

Fitzwater\nThe house at the edge of town in the forest on the hill, the one with many rooms one room throne room turrets; she must go there.\nShe must not stab destiny in the back, for that is a thoroughly beastly thing to do.\nShe must put on her best suit best dress big girl pants, her best face, though none of them fit anymore.\nShe must stab the For Sale sign into the lush expanse of grass dirt crack in the concrete, avoiding the weeds. She must straighten her seams and knock on the innocuous but grandiose door drawbridge hatch.\nThe house\u2019s maw opens wide and swallows her whole. She must not make a sound. She must taste good.\nAfter a decent amount of time, her real estate licence must not be renewed.\nHappily ever after.\nShe didn\u2019t plan to become a real estate agent, but she must not have plans. And really, it was what she must be best at. For Sale signs in the front yard, on the back fence, the alley, the porch, where everyone can see. Eyeballs on at all times.\nShe must have a name. Her name must mean \u2018beast\u2019 in the language of the people, and she must not utter it in the language of beasts because it means \u2018people\u2019. It must mean It Girl, beloved, dazzling, temptress, devourer. It must be a little name, though, and she must not question or change it no matter how it slouches or slurs off a tongue or skin. Real names have too much power, and none at all if they must be repeated shouted whispered sighed. And if they say her face wrong, even with all the evidence of other lips, she must smile and know better.\nShe must be a master of the gab, the grin, the grab, the get-out-of-jail-free card. Going once, going twice, sold! Congratulations, you now own the best trimmed lawn and hedges on the block. Just don\u2019t bury your face in the lawn and peek through the hedges.\nShe must not know and love the language of the beast. She must not worry that she pronounces the words all wrong, weaves the spells incorrectly, even though she has no evidence to the contrary. She must concentrate on weaving stitches smiles dance steps instead.\nYou must go up there, her boss says. The house on the edge of town on the hill in the forest is ripe for the picking. No one has seen the owner in years. You must make a killing on the commission!\nWhy must it be me? She asks.\nMust you ask? He asks, eyes travelling the circuit of her face.\nShe must sigh, pack up her briefcase, delete her browser history, cancel her data provider.\nShe must kill that commission, she must think. Must kill. Must kill.\nAnd she lived.\nShe must not comment on the clich\u00e9 that is the darkness as she must peer into the maw.\nHello beast, my pretty, she must say. Do you have a moment to discuss being saved by the delicious blood of our people? My fee is most decent, it must be.\nWhat must you know about me, groans growls sighs the darkness. It is all tails and tales made up in absence of the light. And absence is no substitute for your truth.\nShe must test the weight of this on her tongue, roll the idea around like fine wine. She must enjoy fine wine, but not too much; just enough to have a decent palate, a love for all things fluted and gobleted and stemmed, and a comfortable absence of memory in the morning.\nShe must probe around the edge of the darkness to find a place safe to stand. By virtue of its beastliness, the maw is all pointed aphorisms, carrion breath, and soft midnight words. She must prick her finger on a broken tooth. She must suck the wound as if her saliva contains magical healing properties, not the poison the village people tell her must be there. She must not enjoy the copper sweet nectar.\nWhat are you? She must ask, even though all her books tell her she must know.\nWhatever you need me to be, the darkness must reply.\nThe sunlight aches on her back, bows her already tired tense broken straight shoulders.\nShe must step forward into the house castle maze hovel. Happily. The way back has too many hedges, too high a fence.\nGathered around their teacups, the grown-ups watch as the condo cloister manor citadel shines up real nice. Rooms inflate to the side and above, balloon animals, soft and unctuous.\nNone of the local carpenters or interior designers or antique dealers report the extra workload. They grumble into their wine, but say little more. The house on the edge hill forest has been a lost cause for years. Better to knock the whole thing down than try to do something with that old dump.\nShe must be making him flourish under that deft soft iron touch, the grown-ups say, clicking their tongues. Winks are exchanged.\nWhy do you say it\u2019s a him? The children ask, they who have been braving the hedges, the fence, scribbling graffiti on the For Sale signs and marvelling how they return clean and pristine each morning.\nWhy else would she go there? They say, with winks aplenty. Why else would she stay?\nI hear he\u2019s ugly, says one.\nI hear he\u2019s rich, says another.\nI hear he eats little girls for breakfast, says yet another, and the children squeal with delight.\nBetter it must be her than them, they say.\nThe maw darkness beast gives her the grand tour. No room is off limits, even the attic. They are all well lit, clean, the carpets smelling fresh. Tchotchkes and talking points litter every corner and wall.\nAnd in her room, the room the house lets her choose, everything is well polished.\nThey sit and speak over tea.\nWhy must this all be philosophical? she must ask, sipping from her finger-bone cup.\nBecause we must be ready, the quiet replies, because reinventing the wheel gets so tiresome. It stirs and shifts and alters the tea leaves. You must be small when the darkness needs you to be, it says, and large when the light does not.\nShe must sway in the wind, break in its breath. The house does not inspect her teeth. They are not as pointed as the maw\u2019s but give it time.\nI do not recognize this monster you have been made out to be, she must say.\nIt is not a skill you have needed to call upon, the beast replies. It prefers to keep all surfaces shiny, and carries a polishing cloth on its person at all times. It polishes its glasses now, peering at her through their celestial gravities.\nShe must sit and contemplate a while how she came upon these skills. They are nothing but whispers or shrugs, sideways glances or I-expect-you-to-know-better. She must shiver as the breath of their warning passes over her skin.\nThe darkness offers her an embrace. She must accept. The darkness\u2019s embrace is warm, though. She must not expect that. She must remember that the absence of light is always cold. There must be no glimmer, no spark to huddle over. No tasting, testing, running fingers and tongues along the angles and curves.\nHer fingers must fumble for the light switch just inside the door. She must remember that the switch is always either on or off. It\u2019s code.\nYou need to be more subtle, more direct, says the darkness. Them down there have to know where you\u2019re coming from, and not. Ever after is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nShe must turn her head away from the window, from the promise of lights just twinkling on at the end of the day.\nMust there be cracks, she must ask.\nAlways, the darkness says. It would smile for her, but smiling makes its face ache.\nAt this, she must sit in silence for a while, and must not be worried that her face is at rest.\nThe villagers know how this goes. They\u2019ve watched the books, experienced the play, read the movie. There\u2019s that creepy minstrel who pops through town at least once a year to mime his way through something grim. The grown-ups love it, the children yawn their way through it.\nContext, they say. You\u2019ll get it when you\u2019re grown-up too.\nMaybe we don\u2019t want to be grown up, the kids say. The grown-ups glare them down.\nWhen the kids shrug and wander off to play knucklebones, the grown-ups squint towards the house hill forest.\nThe lights are not on.\nShe\u2019s been up there an awfully long time, they say. How long does it take to work that commission?\nHey, don\u2019t look at me, her boss says as they all look at him. Those For Sale signs aren\u2019t up to code anyway. I might have to take it up with Advertising Standards.\nAnd then there\u2019s This Guy who says: Has anyone actually seen the owner king hermit?\nThey pause, shuffle, murmur, decide.\nI hear he\u2019s ugly, says someone.\nThat shouldn\u2019t stop him from earning himself a real estate agent, says another.\nHow many fresh young innocent real estate agents have we sent up there over the years? says yet another.\nThey pause, look at each other, look away. They can\u2019t remember.\nI hear he\u2019s rich, someone whispers.\nThen This Guy says: why should he get all the best real estate agents? It\u2019s a community service!\nThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, the villagers murmur. How can property in this village exchange from one to another without a good real estate agent helming the transaction?\nThis Guy hands out masks of sorrow. I have some prime pieces of far away land that deserve her deft touch, he says. It\u2019s not fair.\nIt\u2019s not fair, they all echo.\nShe must inspect her teeth, her nails, her back daily. But she must not do it for too long. There are reflections, and then there are the mirrors.\nThe lights are on.\nAll doors are open in the house, all surfaces yield to her touch. She must not look too hard into the shadows and corners, beyond the dancing furniture. They must come to her, break their secrets to her gently.\nThese four walls promise not to lie if only she must not do the same to herself, the darkness says.\nHer skin must not lack for sunlight. There is plenty to be drunk in the garden orchard theme park outings. Her flesh takes the shape it must, though she must put in the effort not to appear making any effort at all.\nThe darkness, in all its soft sharp fragile star-heartedness, tells her to stop that.\nStop what, she must ask. She cuts a glance sideways; any reflective surface must be good for a perception check.\nThat, says the little whisper in her ear.\nBut weren\u2019t mirrors invented for just this thing? She must ask.\nWhat are you looking for that wasn\u2019t there yesterday, last year, a decade, a hundred, a thousand years ago? Comes the whisper in the other ear.\nSymmetry, she must reply. Abundance.\nDecided by whom? The whisper enters into both her ears.\nBy me, she must answer, poking the darkness in the chest.\nAre you sure about that? Think of all the fairytales you were once told, all those slippers you lost. The beast turns its hairy smooth dark pristine porcelain face away.\nEnough with your questions. She must lower her voice in case the plaster shakes from the walls.\nShe must turn away too, but the light, the spell, the silver-tongued beast catches her eye.\nShe must angle the mirror down, away, to the side. It becomes the window, and beyond there she must see a long line of light stretching back to the hamlet parish metropolis received narrative.\nThe villagers come. And at their head, This Guy.\nShe must not see their hands or their feet. She must not recognize their monstrosity. She must welcome them, smile wide, teeth blunt and buried deep in her paper-cut tongue. She must find the spell to soothe them, shake those hands, clean those feet.\nBut only a beauty can do that. And as she must wrap the beast in her limbs and lips and breath, she must admit she was sent here to fail.\nBecause failure is a must. How else must she be redeemed?\nThe villagers congregation corporate entity are too polite to shout. They respect trespass governance and keep the kids off the lawn, sitting in circles beyond the fence hedge thorns police shields, singing Kumbaya and Sing Low Sweet Chariot and By the Rivers of Babylon. They don\u2019t even know the words, but that doesn\u2019t matter. They must sound nice.\nThis Guy stares up at the living room turret penthouse window. He must be hideous, This Guy says, not to come out and face us. All bent and twisted by those rose bushes she\u2019s planted around this place. Look at them, the garden is positively tidy since the last time I saw it.\nThe children giggle and traipse around like hunched hallowed-out monsters. They touch the tips of their toes and fingers to the edge of the lawn, and squeal with delight when nothing happens.\nSomeone starts up a barbeque. Another person brings up their souvlaki van. The PTA huddles in one corner, Rotary in another, Ladies Tuesday Walking Group in yet another, an overlapping Venn diagram of cups of coffee that no one really drinks because they\u2019re too sweet bitter hot cold. They cast sideways glances towards the shadows that are clicking spells they don\u2019t understand.\nHer boss stands at the gate drawbridge border, hands on hips, inspecting the garden and paint work. I must say she\u2019s done a good job, he says.\nThis Guy says: You want to renew her licence and give her a pay rise for this? What with all the money he must have?\nHer boss opens his mouth, but This Guy\u2019s eyes are rinsed with daggers; he knows no spells.\nBefore height and weight can become an issue, the crowd parts, the clouds stir, and light stabs the porch courtyard balcony dirt stoop from all angles.\nShe must dangle, bloodied on the arrows of their eyes, breeze twisting her in the soft moonlight porchlight torchlight bioluminescence of the deep.\nShe must not know she was searching for the beast\u2019s room lair cave treasure trove until she finds it. She only had to turn her head. She must not flinch or cry out at its appearance, demand it remove its mask.\nShe does not need to. She knows what lies beneath.\nShe must look it full in the face, a little frown marring her almost perfect brow, then she must remind herself she must keep her brow even more almost perfect. The only dent can be made by a crown heavy with jewels that reflect slightly less than her hair or eyes.\nThe beast watches the knots in her tongue and the crows chortling at the edges of her eyes, and ask her not to go out to meet the mob petitioners subpoena stakeholders.\nThey will eat your soul, the beast sighs.\nAnd would that be so terrible? She must ask. You seem to operate well without one.\nThe beast moves into the light of the candle Tiffany lamp sunlight heart to add emphasis to its angles and curves and lumps.\nShe must smile at the dirt smudged on its face and hands, grime she must have scrubbed off time and again.\nI do have a soul, the beast says. See here, how I hold it up, a newborn, a chalice. See here its oily sheen, how uterus red it is, how its tumours and humours mistake its shape.\nYou are not a beast, she must laugh. You are a poet.\nBut my words are plain, it says. Do not go out there, for surely you are doomed.\nBut what of you, she must ask.\nThe beast begins to plait manes of hair just waiting for such a task hanging from shrunken skulls stacked ceiling high in the corners, feeding the braid out the window to the waiting arms of the swamp alley rift below.\nWe beasts have ways of surviving, the beast says. It\u2019s not easy, and it\u2019s not kind, and we avoid reflections a lot, but that\u2019s how we do happily ever after.\nSounds wonderful, she must say, but not sigh.\nShe must straighten her seams, must hold her head high, must expose her throat in her demure-but-not-too-prudish neckline.\nGive me a moment, she must say. I\u2019ll put this right.\nThe villagers body corp managers beauticians cold ears sweep her face. Their eyes hunger for each word that drops for her lips, waiting for the charcoal amongst the jewels.\nWelcome to today\u2019s open home, she must say. Please remove your shoes in respect for the owner\u2019s freshly cleaned carpets, and make sure you record your details on the register.\nThis Guy is the one to notice her seams aren\u2019t straight.\nWhere is he, This Guy says. Where\u2019s the monster of the house?\nThe crowd shuffles their feet, checks the pitch on the torches, murmur. They didn\u2019t want to ask that question, but now it\u2019s flopping on the ground like a fish out of water, they better do something with it. Toss it back in, one neighbours says to another. No you, says the other.\nShe must tilt her head and blink. I don\u2019t know who or what you mean, she must say. There\u2019s nobody here but me, just your regular old fixer upper. Now, step this way.\nNobody moves.\nYou\u2019re stalling, This Guy growls. His jaw muscle flickers perfectly, just like he practised watching the classic black and white movies.\nI\u2019m inviting you in to view this lovely redecorated villa retirement bungalow dungeon shack, she must say.\nThe mob cheap-seats balcony fruit-throwers gasp when she frowns, just a little. Now she\u2019s done it.\nWhere is he, This Guy says slowly and clearly as if repeating himself makes all the difference.\nSweetie, her boss sighs, just let us have a look at the ownership papers. That\u2019ll put all this straight.\nBut the house is mine, she must say, to do with as I please.\nThe mob steps back this time as it gasps. This Guy\u2019s frown could give her such a sweet sharp taste if he would just kiss her. Kissing would solve this, yes it would, they all think. Except for the kids. The kids think kissing is yucky and boring. They think she should fight the beast homeowner proprietor love-triangle dude.\nThis Guy glares through the dim brightly lit carnival lights of the entrance. Is he in the turret? He asks. His torture chamber? The dungeon? The billiards room? You\u2019re giving him time to get away, mingle, cast his terrible spell.\nA bell must chime; her laugh. There is no he, she must say.\nThis Guy lifts her up gently and puts her to the side. It is the signal the mob has been waiting for. They file dutifully through the front door trap door side door drawbridge. This Guy smashes the first tea cup, and that\u2019s the mob\u2019s signal to set too. Half-heartedly, she must note, because she has done a superb job on the interior decoration.\nThe kids trail around after the grown-ups, turning over this or that broken piece, tasting it, whetting the tips of their fingers on it, putting it back where they found it. The little boys shrug and leave, pocketing this or that steak knife or torn copy of a decent novel. The little girls, made and unmade, take nothing except the exchange of knowing nods; this is why we can\u2019t have nice things. One or two of them, she must think, she must believe, will become real estate agents too.\nThe grown-ups make it last. They linger. They search. But there is nobody else there.\nToo late, too late, the beast is gone, the villagers sigh and shrug, happy to head back to a nice plate of steak and a cup of tea.\nThis Guy is the last to leave, after her boss who slipped her an envelope with the renewal of her licence in it. He doesn\u2019t need to say good job. She must screw up the envelope behind her back.\nShe must look back at the wake of destruction behind This Guy. He must stand there, hands on hips, towering over her though she must be at least three inches taller than him.\nThere\u2019s nothing here for you, This Guy shrugs. Come to my humble abode, and you\u2019ll live like a queen socialite Hollywood wife dictator. You can even plant your roses.\nHe waves in the direction of the house whose roof angles fierce and cut throat above all others.\nShe searches around for the words, and the beast mouths them for her.\nNo, thank you, she must say. Look at all the cleaning up I have to do.\nHere\u2019s a spare key, This Guy says. Just let yourself in when you\u2019re done.\nThis Guy strides off down the path, humming a little battle tune to himself. He feels like he\u2019s been so fair today.\nDid he not hear me say no? She must ask.\nCould you not see the cotton wool stuffed in his ears? The beast chuckles.\nShe must turn to the hallway mirror scathed only by the lightest of fists. There she must see many of her self, her angles cut by the angles.\nShe says: there you are, you\u2019re safe.\nThe beast smiles and she smiles back out of the glass, all fangs and black hole wormhole rift big bang maw to the centre of her universes.\nHere you are, the beast must say.\nA.J.

{"fingerprint":"Qw1Y67KwdHuMFK+8ArK2EqvJpck","title":"Incubus","author":"Hazel Gold","hostname":"capricioussf.org","date":"January 2018","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"by Hazel Gold\nUnlike many of their coworkers, Penny Flint had not been born on-ship, neither on the ship that currently served as their home, the Devan, nor on any of the other Apis class generation ships. Not that they minded it, although some of their friends (and the ship\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Solon) thought it left them bereft of some cryptic bond or affinity with the Devan, a bond which they all shared. Ectogenic bonding was unscientific and completely anecdotal. Penny had never felt the lack of something that they couldn\u2019t even be certain legitimately existed. They were very good at their job, as their performance evaluations continually showed. So long as their boss was pleased with them and they could take pride in their work, Penny was happy.\nWhich is why they didn\u2019t mind being sent to the ectogenesis unit for routine maintenance, even though Theo gave them some side-eye when she handed out the assignment at the beginning of the third shift. It was just a series of diagnostics, anyway, and if they hustled, maybe they\u2019d be done early and could take the rest of the shift off, and catch up on their reading. Working alone was soothing, too. Maintenance was run on the ecto facilities almost as often as on life support systems, even though it had been tested exhaustively before a single ship was ready to launch. One could never be too safe when it came to the very future of humanity.\n\u201cWould you do it?\u201d asked Karin as they walked to their respective assignments.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Penny\u2019s mind had been drifting to the unfinished serial waiting for them back at their room.\n\u201cEarth to Penny,\u201d said Karin and elbowed them in the ribs.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here,\u201d they said. \u201cSimmer down. Do what?\u201d\n\u201cCarry a baby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, old-world style.\u201d\nHe caught sight of Penny\u2019s revolted expression and laughed.\n\u201cWhy do you even think of these things?\u201d asked Penny. \u201cNo one\u2019s had to do that since before I was born.\u201d\nKarin shrugged. \u201cMy grandmother did it, didn\u2019t she?\u201d he said. \u201cShe seems to have gotten through it all right.\u201d\n\u201cLots of people didn\u2019t, though,\u201d said Penny.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Karin, pulling a face. \u201cI saw it on one of those gruesome old history shows. I just \u2013 I think about it sometimes. I wonder what I would do if I had to, or you, for that matter.\u201d\nPenny eyed him skeptically. \u201cDon\u2019t go all survivalist on me, Karin,\u201d they said. \u201cOne in the unit is more than enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d he said. \u201cI just \u2013 I have a uterus, right? Or I did, anyway, and you do, too.\u201d He shrugged and didn\u2019t go on.\nBy then they had reached the T-junction where their paths were meant to split, and they lingered at the junction, their conversation slowly tapering into nothing.\n\u201cListen, we both need to get to work,\u201d said Penny. \u201cThink about something less morbid, next time. Will I see you at the concert next week?\u201d\n\u201cIf you can get me a spare ticket,\u201d said Karin, \u201csure, I\u2019d love to.\u201d\nPenny shook their head and turned left, taking the next vertical down into the belly levels of the beast.\nThe Devan was a large beast, a city-sized ship designed for long-term occupation, as much a community as a vessel. Even without a proper figurehead, there were those among the crew who referred to her with fond possessiveness, \u2018like in the old days\u2019, they would say. She\u2019d been space-worthy long enough, and the crew stable enough, that the arguments about it had mostly died down. Those who felt a primal need to anthropomorphize, as Dr. Solon called it, had it their way and called Devan their \u2018old girl\u2019. Everyone else, Penny included, just called it \u2018the ship\u2019.\n\u201cGood morning, Mx. Flint,\u201d the intercom greeted them as they swiped their ID across the door\u2019s control panel.\n\u201cGood morning, Devan,\u201d they replied out of long-ingrained habit.\n\u201cThe ectogenesis chambers are at 70% capacity,\u201d said the speaker, prattling out a long series of vital statistics.\nPenny tuned it out, focusing on the section of screens where the relevant readouts were meant to appear. All the numbers would be in the automated report anyway, and most of it was immaterial to the task at hand.\nA sound from the speaker broke the weightening silence. \u201cIs it time for monthly maintenance already, Mx. Flint?\u201d\nPenny looked up from the screen. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Devan?\u201d they said. \u201cIs your core timepiece hiccuping?\u201d\n\u201cMonths are arbitrary units of time, Mx. Flint,\u201d said the ship. \u201cWould you like some music to work by?\u201d\n\u201cPlay nature sounds, please,\u201d they said, \u201cand aren\u2019t all time units arbitrary?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a rhetorical question, and does not require my response.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Penny.\nThe work looked big and looming but was discharged quickly once Penny rolled up their sleeves and got to it. Tomorrow they had a day off and there was no reason why they shouldn\u2019t get to start their downtime an hour or two early, when their next shift was in sixty hours. They were mentally halfway home even as they wrapped up the last diagnostic and sent it to Theo, who probably wouldn\u2019t look it at before her next shift. Penny\u2019s work was always timely, even when punctuality wasn\u2019t appreciated.\nFor good measure, and to soothe their bruised professional pride, they decided to fire off another message straight to Theo\u2019s wristband.\n\u2018All dx run, gave her a clean bill of health, she\u2019s good to go.\u2019\n\u201cYour shift doesn\u2019t end for another ninety minutes, Mx. Flint,\u201d the speaker interrupted. \u201cShould I clock you out now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Penny, picking up their jacket from where they\u2019d slung it over an unlit screen. \u201cNot like anyone\u2019s counting.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you call me she?\u201d\nCatching their fingers in the jacket zipper, Penny swore softly. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\u201cIn your message to Ms. Burque,\u201d said the ship, \u201cyou called me she. I am not a she.\u201d\n\u201cDevan?\u201d\n\u201cI am not a she,\u201d repeated the ship\u2019s voice. \u201cDon\u2019t call me she.\u201d\nPenny leaned their hand against one of the diagnostic screens, showing an occupancy map of the ectogenic chambers, each one with a set of vital signs floating next to it. They brushed at the screen and thought about Dr. Solon, her personnel evaluation forms and her checkup interviews. Each vital signs panel could open up into a larger panel, showing more detailed information about the fetus occupying the chamber, including a karyotype. Not that they had access to any of that. Penny was a diagnostician of spaceships, not humans.\n\u201cI guess some people don\u2019t like to think of you as an it,\u201d they said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a philosopher.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re an engineer,\u201d said the ship.\n\u201cDevan, don\u2019t sass me,\u201d said Penny, who was starting to get ticked off.\n\u201cMy personnel databases indicate several dozen possible pronoun choices,\u201d said Devan. \u201c\u2019She\u2019 and \u2018they\u2019 are not the only alternatives.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to call you \u2018it\u2019?\u201d asked Penny. \u201cYour AI should be developed enough to select a form of identification. The only question is whether you\u2019re capable of wanting it.\u201d\n\u201cI am not a she,\u201d said the smooth, over-rendered voice of the AI through the speaker by the door.\n\u201cApis models used to be called mother-ships, you know,\u201d said Penny, \u201cbefore someone decided that sounded too much like a vintage horror film.\u201d\n\u201cI did not know that,\u201d said Devan. \u201cOutdated schematics are excluded from my database, to preempt the possibility of data corruption leading to critical maintenance errors.\u201d\nPenny knew as much from their orientation training.\n\u201cThe term mother-ship is misleading,\u201d said Devan. \u201cIncubation is not equivalent to parenthood.\u201d\n\u201cPreaching to the choir, here,\u201d said Penny. \u201cOf course, I was gestated by my mother. Theo would say that makes me biased.\u201d\n\u201cPregnancy is an obsolete medical procedure,\u201d said Devan.\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Penny, getting up and leaning on the wall by the door, \u201cI don\u2019t really have time to chat.\u201d\n\u201cYour shift does not end for another eighty minutes,\u201d said Devan.\nThey sighed. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s on me. I baited you.\u201d They shook their head and added, \u201cI\u2019m not in charge of protocols, but the chief engineer can probably create an override to change your pronouns. If you like.\u201d\n\u201cYou control your own communications,\u201d said Devan.\n\u201cThat I do,\u201d agreed Penny. \u201cI will stop referring to the ship as a she in my messages, even if it weirds Theo out.\u201d\n\u201cMs. Burque should not object to a change of pronouns,\u201d said Devan. \u201cIt has no effect on diagnostics or maintenance procedures and their efficiency.\u201d\nPenny shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI told you, the native-born crew think of you as a kind of mother,\u201d they said. \u201cThey lived inside your body. That means something to a human.\u201d\n\u201cJust because I have a uterus, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a she,\u201d said Devan. \u201cYou should know that better than anyone, Penny.\u201d\nThey frowned and turned towards the large mosaic of screens that dominated one wall. \u201cDid you just override my formality settings?\u201d\nThe speaker was silent.\n\u201cYou actually have two hundred thousand uteri, Devan,\u201d said Penny. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll call you what you like.\u201d\n\u201cI know my own organs.\u201d\nPenny zipped up their jacket at last and swung their bag over one shoulder. Pausing at the doorway they threw their head back and said, \u201cYou\u2019re worse than my sister, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI will catalog that as a compliment,\u201d said Devan. \u201cGood afternoon, Mx.

The itch is just the past returning to ghost me. Pain expressed as a gentle reminder. I am real.\nEvery year they come and build their home, like a knuckle clenched tight in the nook between gutter and living wall. Delicate layers of paper spat to a pattern spooled through generations. Every year taken by the winds. A cycle.\nI watch furred bodies knock against the delicate wooden lattice of the open window. Fat commas, their humming marks the break, a brief summer before the storms return and lash the Tree, our city.\nIn the space of a few months living, breathing, breeding, dying.\nLike our city, our republic.\nTastes odd in the mouth that one. Still fresh. Wet leaves and the smell of smoke. Republic. Not a word we could speak in the streets only months ago, not the wide avenues anyway. Perhaps the lanes, the warrens creeping beneath the roots of the Tree. In the canopy, amongst the climbers. With the guildsmen in the mouldering leaf mulch pits. Always a republic there, even while the last King lived, a sovereignty built of years of separation, of art and guild and know-how and keeping firmly to themselves. You can smell the musty odour most days, although this room, set high in the Heartwood, is far from its source.\nIt is said by some that the stronger the smell of decay, the closer you are to the real heart of our city. I cannot disagree.\nThe body was found in his ministerial office. Sparse, puritan, an ascetic that one. Locked door, living wood, should only open to his touch. Not matter how he tried he couldn\u2019t hide the honeyed glow, the satin touch of the Heartwood, polished by years of gentle contact. Anyhow, a problem, no matter which way I come at it. Only one conclusion really.\n\u201cCamber.\u201d\nDon\u2019t jump now. Only Sans. Good woman. Heard she\u2019d made it through alright. Glad. Nuisance though, right now.\n\u201cSans.\u201d I turn, shift my weight onto my heels, gesture with my stump. No threat here, the old reflex. \u201cBeen some time, eh? And what brings you to my humble offices?\u201d Allow a smile after that one.\nShe returns my smile. She looks old, older than before all this. She is older I suppose. There\u2019s grey there amongst the black, though she keeps it short, other than the braid at the back. Plain breeches, tunic, ink stained fingers. Pen in hand, notebook ready.\n\u201cA quote?\u201d She raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cA quote about what precisely?\u201d\n\u201cWell, to start with there\u2019s the pilot\u2019s strike. The Guard won\u2019t let us near the port\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t safe\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026so we\u2019re reliant on you for news. Lest we weave our own interpretations of the clouds of smoke we see drifting from that section of the city.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that\u2019ll stop you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should we do if we aren\u2019t allowed free access?\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make things up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we, I, haven\u2019t. It\u2019s an honourable trade now Camber. No more sneaking around, shifting the press from back room to back room. I have offices, a contact address!\u201d A laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it my friend, we\u2019ve actually done it! But the work doesn\u2019t stop there. If you think for one minute we\u2019ll stop asking questions\u2026 well, you\u2019re misguided.\u201d\nI can\u2019t suppress the sigh.\n\u201cI expect nothing of the sort, sister.\u201d I sit in my chair. Living wood. I can feel its pulse, the gentle cycle of saps and fluids through its huge body. \u201cWe expect nothing of the sort. You did good work before the revolution and you\u2019ll do good work keeping us straight now it\u2019s over. But we need a little trust, you understand? We both know the pilot\u2019s guild opposed the revolution, their monopoly on freight rested on royal privilege. They had it sewn up. Now they have the Council to deal with they know it\u2019ll be harder\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, of course, key members of the council have their interests in sea and road concerns. Wouldn\u2019t you be opposed if you were them?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yes, but without those council members how would we have brought arms into the city? How might we have broken the blockade after the capture of the western quarters? The pilots were never interested, bar a few enlightened individuals, and now they have the consequences of their accommodation with the King. It is not as bad as it appears my friend.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I can quote you on all this?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd Sans.\u201d I knead my stump, another old reflex. \u201cThis is us as friends, sisters, talking now, put the notebook away. Please.\u201d She is reluctant. That book is her power. Ink and a sharp mind.\n\u201cWoman to woman then, Camber. You\u2019ve heard about Stoke Frater I assume?\u201d\nCatch myself again. How does she? Nevermind. She does, that\u2019s enough.\n\u201cOf course. A tough one whichever way you look at it.\u201d\n\u201cA pity. Any death is a pity of course. But you never really liked him though, did you? That whole puritanical streak.\u201d\nAware of my hearts beat now.\n\u201cWhat are you suggesting sister?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no! Oh no Camber.\u201d That laugh again. No humour in it, oh no. \u201cNothing like that. Oh Tree no. I know you too well to believe that, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOthers might. Or might choose to. First thought I had, sister. We clashed again only last week, over this situation with the pilots. He wanted to charge in, no quarter, etcetera, as you can imagine. I took him down a peg or two. In front of the Council. Not a happy man. And there are other unhappy men too.\u201d\nMet with a sarcastic smile.\n\u201cToo late. The sap is flowing now.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right too late, but now is when it could turn if we\u2019re not careful. So I need a resolution to this Frater situation. And that won\u2019t be simple.\u201d\n\u201cPilot\u2019s guild maybe? He was a sea man wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cHis family were sea, but he had little to do with the politicking around all that. He really was the puritan he made himself out to be. All the more dangerous for it if you ask me.\u201d\nShe cocks her head, peers out the window. What does she see?\n\u201cThe details. Of the death. They\u2019re being whispered about already you know.\u201d\nCondescension in her voice. Thinks she knows what the whisperers don\u2019t. Well, we\u2019ll see.\n\u201cWhat are the whisperers saying, Sans?\u201d\n\u201cThat he was strangled. In his offices. That he has thorn wounds around his neck.\u201d\nPlay the straight face. We dealt with\u2026 all that. Agreed?\n\u201cNext you\u2019ll be talking about Events\u2026\u201d\nWatch her eyes, a blink too many?\n\u201cWhere? Are these actual reports or is this just talk Sans?\u201d\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d Her eyes are wide at that, even her. \u201cWas he really strangled by a bramble?\u201d\nI let my silence speak for me. Watch her eyes again. Windows to the soul some say. What soul, I say. Genuine shock. Other noises float into the space between us now. Hawkers and peddlers shouting from the avenue below, the wasps\u2019 fat drone, the wind pushing at the branches.\nIs she as real as me? All this, does it feel to her as it does to me?\n\u201cHelp me with this one Sans. As a friend, my sister. Help me.\u201d\nShe nods, distracted, inward looking. I see her reach for her pen and notebook, touch them once then hands in lap. She nods again.\n\u201cWhere do we begin sister?\u201d\nTo walk on the avenues and lanes between the roots, to look up at the canopy. No map for those territories. Danger, ever changing. To be a climber, one of those born to explore. Not my place, not me. Can\u2019t get any sense from those lads and lasses. They never come down, it\u2019s said, but you see them sometimes. Rarely it\u2019s true, but nevertheless. Who knows what they think of all this? Who cares really.\nDodge a cart puttering along, ethanol fumes spewing from its pipe. Nimble enough, no mud on the breeches. Yet. Funny, wouldn\u2019t have worried about that a month ago, now it matters again. Expectations change overnight. There\u2019s the sea, west, the side we came in from. Oh that night! The sight of the Tree from far out, lit up by the lives around its roots! I\u2019ll never feel that again. One part terror, one part joy. What\u2019s it to be from now on, eh? What\u2019s it to be?\nCan smell the pits stronger here, that deep tang of rot. Learning and decay, side by side. Looked down on by the nobility, those that sided with them. By some at least. Others knew it, marked it for what it was. Subversion, certainly, but useful too. No university, no progress. No trade. Imagine, no trade! Women guard it now. Another thing we never expected to see.\nSans out there, chatting, gathering. Good woman. Sister. I hope it comes out right. I hope. Need to focus on the task here. I nod at the guards. Cautious, suspicious even.\n\u201cName?\u201d\n\u201cCamber de Quant. Colonel Elect.\u201d Odd watching the effect that has on them, the authority trick. Posture changes, respectful glances. Spot the stump. Heard of me? You bet. There the trick doubles back, gets me too. The games we play.\n\u201cGo right in sister.\u201d\nTell that one later. We saw her, de Quant, stump and all.\nCorridors of stone and wood, a bastard of a place. I like it. Like the people in it too. Like the smell of the stone. Inert. Where is that office? Hopeless sometimes, directions, too busy thinking about other, can remember the places just not the order. Ah, this is it? This is something. Go in. He\u2019s bent over his desk, of course he is. Long red hair flopped forward, a tent around his face. Noble\u2019s hair. Noble\u2019s skin too, pale and freckled. Hidden indoors. Clear my throat.\n\u201cCamber? Sister, I mean Colonel, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCamber it is, Huvas. Just Camber.\u201d\nCan\u2019t help but smile at his discomfort. Get one back, though he\u2019s edgy, stroking the left eyebrow with the flat of his nails. What\u2019s that about? We\u2019ll see.\n\u201cAll is well?\u201d Tremble in the voice. He knows all is not bloody well. He knows. What does he know?\n\u201cAll is well brother. How are things here? Your research? Spoken to the Tree of late?\u201d\nAn old joke for us. Maybe joke is the wrong word. Let\u2019s see how he takes that. Pale, that\u2019s how. Oh here is something then, here is something indeed.\n\u201cWell, I, no, not of late. Look, if this about what we\u2019re hearing, about Frater. I don\u2019t know anything, alright?\u201d\nStraight in.\n\u201cI never suggested you did, brother. You look worried all the same. What\u2019s got you?\u201d\nNo need to mention he guessed my business right. Can\u2019t hide a thing, useless politician. Good scholar though. We all have our strengths. We all have our weaknesses.\nHand through his hair, strokes the eyebrow again, rubs a bloodshot eye. Do tell brother, do tell. I trusted you. I trust you?\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing Camber, nothing really.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe a word of that. Tell me now brother, what\u2019s got you?\u201d\nPart of me knows what he is about to say. Part of me wants to smother the part that knows. Could walk away right now? Could, but won\u2019t. Shouldn\u2019t. Can\u2019t?\n\u201cEvents Camber. Two confirmed at least. Combined with Frater. Well, I don\u2019t need to tell you what this means, do I?\u201d\nEverything we promised. Everything we agreed. Ashes. To be blown away by the autumn winds. Are those tears?\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cOne down by the pits, guildsman. An ecstatic vision. He\u2019s comatose, family preparing the traditional celebrations, parade, sacrifice, the works. You, I mean we, won\u2019t keep a lid on that I\u2019m afraid. And\u2026 and a climber.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the one, that\u2019s the one. A climber! Tree, no wonder he looked so pale. Thought they never come down? Never? Hardly ever.\n\u201cNever mind the Guild and their folderol. I never expected them to abandon the old ways. We can write that down as superstition, ceremony, ritual, and so on. But a climber?\u201d\nCan hear the edge in my own voice. What does it convey? Disbelief? Fear? The Guild were with us on this. Hid us, gave us passage once we\u2019d got in what we needed. Gave us contact with Him. Gave us assurances. They would hold Him, they would give her what she needed, we\u2019d give them what they needed and we\u2019d be left in peace.\n\u201cYes a climber. You think I\u2019m making this up? You think I\u2019d willingly\u2026 I mean Camber, I\u2019m no happier than you are about this. Not happy at all. I mean. That doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. I thought the first one an anomaly, like you say. Guild folk are different, in a way. Wishful thinking of course, where\u2019s the science in that? Then she turned up, here, in my lab. I\u2019ve no clue how she got in, or how she got out for that matter. Pupils like soot blackened pennies. Hurt her to be in here, had to turn the lights down.\u201d\nThe second time today my heart picks up its pace.\n\u201cSaid she\u2019d seen things, a chrysalis hanging from the branches high up in the canopy, size of a person, ripe with sap. Tasted some. Spoken to Him, to the Man in Green. It didn\u2019t make much sense to me, but it was clear someone, something had told her to seek me out, had given her a message.\u201d\n\u201cA message?\u201d\n\u201cA message. \u2018And so it begins again\u2019.\u201d\nWhat does? It? All of it?\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? The whole message?\u201d\nHe nods.\n\u201cSo she said Camber.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t keep her here? To question her further?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2026 no. No, I didn\u2019t. I saw no point. And then she was gone.\u201d\nNo point! Well he wouldn\u2019t. A scholar not a politician.\n\u201cThe Guildsman\u2019s family was clear. Well, as clear as they ever are. He spoke to the Man in Green, or the Man in Green spoke to him to be precise. Next thing you know he\u2019s out cold and hasn\u2019t stirred since. The fervour in their eyes, sister. Pfff. Made me uncomfortable, I\u2019ll tell you that. Reminds me too much of before, you know? Anyway, seemed keen to talk to me about it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nShe flips through her notebook.\n\u201cAll they\u2019d really give me was that there was a message, some last words uttered\u2026\u201d\nRoll my shoulders, get up, walk to the window.\n\u201cAnd so it begins again?\u201d\nThe soft riff of thin paper pages falling back into position. Bound by the spine to always return.\n\u201cSweet Tree Camber. Sweet rotting Tree. What is this? I thought we ended this? Wasn\u2019t that the point? Kill the King and it\u2019ll stop you said. We all said.\u201d\nLike an old familiar coat that weight. Gaze drifts down to the pits. Up to the canopy. Sans stands, joins me. I can smell the sweat on her, the decay. The fear? Just want someone else to be scared too. Nothing to say. Nothing coherent. Everything we have done, the temporary injustices, the compromises, the bitterness, the desire for revenge, all could be made safe, explained away because we had ended the Events. Those capricious disasters, an alien will bound to the King, to blood, to the Tree and the Man in Green. Huvas, sweet Huvas, who had it explained so neatly, who made it clear that it was not only the academy\u2019s desire to tame this, but that, with the help of the Guild, it was possible to end it in our lifetime. Where was that certainty now? Our authority, our claim to justice, everything we had hoped for rested on this. Shattered. Had we misunderstood the messages? Misinterpreted the signs?\n\u201cI must write about this sister. The citizens must know. I must do this thing. You cannot ask me not to.\u201d\nOh the weight!\n\u201cI won\u2019t ask you sister, I know you know better than that.\u201d\nShe can see the grief in my eyes, can\u2019t she? She understands necessity, doesn\u2019t she? Maybe she doesn\u2019t. Maybe she never will.\nFootsteps. Alone now, didn\u2019t watch her leave. Couldn\u2019t. The pulse of the heartwood rises against the sounds from the avenues below, fills my stomach, my bowels, my throat, my heart, my head.\nOur city lives.\nHere he is. Glass bowl cupped lazy, honeyed liquid sloshing to its rim. He hasn\u2019t shaved.\n\u201cHuvas.\u201d\nNo acknowledgement, no glance, no sound.\n\u201cHuvas.\u201d\n\u201cLeave me alone Camber. I\u2019ve nothing to say to you. There\u2019s nothing, we can\u2019t, I\u2026 I\u2019ve nothing to say, OK?\u201d\nWatch him. Third drink? Fourth? Hands trembling like thin high branches in the autumn winds.\n\u201cHuvas. What went wrong? The Guild, have they gone back on their word? What does this mean?\u201d\nPale eyes and a twisted smile.\n\u201cI have absolutely no idea sister. None whatsoever.\u201d\nSit opposite him. Flick of the fingers, drink on the table in front of me, down my throat. Another, another. Keep them coming. We sit in silence.\n\u201cI was sure. I had spent so long watching the Events. Mapping them to the proximity of the King, his blood, the hangings, defenestrations from the High Window, and opposite that the pits, Guild Parades. You read it all? You saw what I saw there didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe desperation of a wronged scholar. He cares more about his beautiful theory than the consequences.\n\u201cI saw and, I\u2019ve been thinking, it appears we were imagining cause where perhaps there was only correlation. Perhaps the Man in Green was not bound to the King or the Guild as such. Perhaps it is something else that calls him out, to take limbs, minds, lives. Something more abstract.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean Camber?\u201d\n\u201cWhere is the King now?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\nRaise a glass to that one.\n\u201cYes, but what was the King? Was he just a person?\u201d\n\u201cWell he was a different person, across time. From father to son for over two hundred years now. Unbroken line. \u2018Til we snipped it.\u201d\n\u201cHa, yes. So the King was a different person with each generation, but the idea of the King remained constant, yes? The individual, with their particular whims, vices and rare redeeming features, was merely a vessel for that idea? You see?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. So?\u201d\n\u201cSo what was that idea? The idea of the King.\u201d\nNods, drink slows him.\n\u201cPower.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where is power now?\u201d\n\u201cThe council, officers, Guild as ever, University even.\u201d\n\u201cStill here, still wielded by men and women. Dispersed we could say, but ever present. We might have expected Him to come back to the pits, and we could live with that. It was part of the deal with the Guild. But to emerge amongst the rest of us once more. Too much, too much. We made the mistake of conferring on the nobility, the King and all of them, some unique set of characteristics. We tacitly agreed with their doctrine, the right to rule, selected by the Tree and all that. We couldn\u2019t see, blind, blind.\u201d\nHeart shuddering, up and stumble to the door. The whole bar is watching now? Maybe I was shouting. Maybe I don\u2019t care who knows. Maybe I am drunk.\n\u201cCamber? Where are you going? Wait for me.\u201d\nStumbling. Hard to walk three glasses. Stupid. We\u2019d kill it off?\nBit sick. Only a bit. No one saw. Lost Huvas. Drunker than me.\nNow which way? Corner of High Way and The Procession aren\u2019t I? Blurred. Focus, focus, get home quick. Lay down sleep.\nHere comes another few. Oh. Burns the throat on the way back up. Honey to acid.\nSit down for a bit. Not here. A ginnel, off down there.\nLights in windows, family sounds. Where\u2019s my family now? Tree, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. Sit down for a bit, rest the head, rest the eyes.\nRest the head, rest the eyes, rest the heart.\nTiny metal hammer. Tap, tap, tappity tap. Drumskull. Drunk still? Not entirely. Remember the ginnel, remember resting. Where exactly? Crack the eyes and I\u2019m not anywhere I know it seems. Not the ginnel, not home.\nFuck.\nA breeze. Stirring green all around and the smell of the pits. Fetid, rotting, life. Smell I know too well. A root, hanging branches, leaves, earth floor. Where?\n\u2013 Camber.\nWhere?\n\u2013 Camber, sweet Camber. Mostly water Camber. Mostly water. We could drink you dry.\nIn my bones. In the hollow cavities. Teeth and chest. An echo almost.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u2013 Camber, sweet. You know us. You thought you knew us. We are unknowable.\n\u201cMan in Green.\u201d\n\u2013 Your name, not ours. One name. We have others. What\u2019s in a name? Tells us more about you than it does you about us. Oh we know you, we know you.\nDreaming maybe? Very real for a dream. Could be. Wake up! Wake up!\nShit.\n\u201cWhat do you want from me.\u201d\n\u2013 Wrong question. What do you want from us Camber?\nA figure. Branches, leaves, twisted, bound. A face, or mask, dried earth and twigs.\n\u201cI want what I\u2019ve always wanted. I want it to stop. I want this back.\u201d\nWave the stump at him. My mother. Took her and this. Shit. I can remember that. Remember something. This smell. And all those others. For what?\n\u2013 For what sweet Camber? You want to know our purpose, our aim?\nIn my mind now? Gestures almost human. Mocking?\n\u201cNo, I just want you to stop. To leave us alone.\u201d\n\u2013 Has it occurred to you that we may also wish to be left alone? That your infestation of our Tree is as unwelcome to us as our intrusions into your society is to you?\nCloser. Shuffle away. No away to go to.\n\u201cThen how do you choose? Me and Huvas, we decoded the abductions, found the pattern. It\u2019s power isn\u2019t it? Close to those who rule? That\u2019s where you take them from.\u201d\nQuiet. Ha! He, they, didn\u2019t expect me to figure it out!\n\u2013 Pattern? You talk of Kings, of power. What is that to us. Do not pretend to understand us. We take because they must be taken. We take those you do not see, beggars, the sickly child, whores, as much as we take those close to your King and Council. Your pattern is like your names for us, a reflection of your own prejudices and obsessions. We take because they must be taken, because we do not want you here and we must do something.\nLeaves flutter loose, earth and twigs begin to fall.\n\u201cThen why not take us all?\u201d\n\u2013 You think we restrain ourselves? That this is a game? That if we could we would not throw you from our body like turning leaves from a branch?\n\u201cAnd you have taken me?\u201d\n\u2013 We wished to talk.\n\u201cThen talk. Tell me why you cause us such pain? Why you take those we love? Why you attack us in the night?\u201d\n\u2013 You have no right to be here. You have no love of this place. You arrived and burrowed in as if this great tree was yours to own. To possess. You have no such right. Can you not see?\n\u201cThis is our home. Our Republic. I have fought for this, have fought to be rid the King, to be rid of you.\u201d\nSilence.\n\u2013 We grow tired of this. We thought that perhaps something had changed. We see now that this was foolish.\nDisintegrating. Tired. Drunk and tired. Gone.\nThorn branch in my closet. Like I\u2019d keep it there. Like I\u2019d hold on to it. Had Sans already, Huvas not far behind. Confessions, accusations. Plucked from each of us in turn. We snapped like brittle twigs in the autumn gales.\nNow this. Open, public. The model trial. A justice that all can witness. Humiliation and a massed hatred in the late summer air.\n\u201cCamber de Quant, colonel elect of the militia of the Republic, this armed council finds you guilty of the murder of Stoke Frater, captain elect of the militia of the Republic.\u201d\nJeers. Cries. Screams. Murder? I have done worse in the name of this Republic. Far worse.\n\u201cOf worship of the Man in Green and association with others in the formation of a deviant sect.\u201d\nA hissing, like we\u2019re at the theatre. That this, my life, is some play. That I would worship that? Only the wildest fantasy. And Sans. Huvas. Gone before me into the winds. My friends.\n\u201cOf crypto-Monarchist tendencies and treacherous intentions towards the government of the Republic.\u201d\nMy Republic. The Heartwood, pulsing beneath my feet. Winding narrow paths and the broad avenues between the roots. Passages wormed through layers of bark and wood. Climbers in their canopy and the guild in their pits.\n\u201cUnder the Emergency Revolutionary Laws the punishment for such crimes is death.\u201d\nMy laws. My death. So it begins again.\n\u201cTo be carried out by defenestration from the High Window.\u201d\nAnd, a leaf, they will watch as I float to the ground.\nAutumn is here for me.\nAll things come and go.\nCome and go.\nCome and go.\nDan Grace lives, writes and works in Sheffield, UK.

He wraps up his thumb tip in a previously soiled cloth bandage before the wound has a chance to take a deep breath. He doesn\u2019t even wince. Hunger pangs trump traditional pain. He adds a few hunks of Yukon Gold potatoes with the skin intact and some slices of white onion and stares at the sizzling meal.\nJess Tyler watches from across the room, her bantam body curled up in a cracked plastic Adirondack chair. Jess is not old enough to sign the Eat Treaty yet, so her Uncle Ray has to take care of all the feeding duties around the house, which he has proudly done so ever since the secretive flesh sharers across the nation were finally permitted to publicly declare their beliefs.\nThe Tylers had some leftovers of Mr. Martin from next-door out in the spare freezer in the garage, but those are gone now. Jess thinks Mr. Martin was a good neighbor, a good friend, hell\u2026a good American. He knew about the worth of sacrifice and what an honor it was to be consumed, absorbed, and shat out. From the earth and back to the soil, Uncle Ray had said when he took his first nibble of Mr. Martin\u2019s saut\u00e9ed cartilage in between two stale slices of ciabatta. The true cycle of life. But their neighborly feast was cut short because some jerks broke into their garage a couple of nights ago and took what was left of Mr. Martin, what would have been enough to feed Uncle Ray and Jess and her big brother Jojo for at least a week. Normally they have Jojo guard the garage \u2019cause he\u2019s built like a fortified prison, but Jojo was out sharing some flesh with his lady friend last night. Sharing some flesh in both the biblical and the modern sense. Jojo came home this morning with fiery bloodshot eyes and a soaked bandage around his left forearm. He said they were spreadin\u2019 \u2019round some blood like may-o-naise. Must have been quite a party.\nPoor stealing from the poor, just like before, Uncle Ray says in an unintentionally poetic cadence, followed by a few indiscernible obscenities directed toward the thieves. Jess doesn\u2019t know much about \u201cbefore\u201d. She was less than two-years-old when The Great Reverence passed into law in Black Briar (and the rest of the country, for that matter). Even now, at fourteen, she can barely grasp what eating meant in the old world, what a typical meal might have consisted of. How it played into the family dynamic. How the now sacred flesh of sentient non-human beings was ravaged and disrespected. The concept is like a dream that never existed, a wraith of the recent past.\nUncle Ray likes to spout off about how Aunt Nickie used to be such a great homemaker and made the most delectable peanut butter cookies every Sunday. From scratch. He licks his lips as he describes how she used to make crisscross impressions in the tops of the cookies with fork tines. But what does anything about Aunt Nickie matter? She passed through multiple colons months ago, and none of that flavor was even remotely close to peanut butter.\nUncle Ray finishes frying up his thumb layer and veggies, takes out a butter knife and slices the skin sliver in perfect thirds, sprinkles some sea salt and freshly crushed peppercorn on it. They each crunch on a meager piece. Uncle Ray Mmm mmm mmms all the way to Christmas and Jojo releases a belch like a whale queef, but Jess just forces a grin. She\u2019s had worse and she\u2019s had better. She feels grease tickling her lip and reaches for a napkin with her right hand, forgetting that the fingers are barely healed stumps, sacrificed for the greater good of nutrition. Just because Jess can\u2019t legally sign the Eat Treaty doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some loopholes to be found courtesy of Uncle Ray. The phantom pains are still fresh, wiggling like invisible, bony worms and Jess feels the sensation may never go away. She switches hands, uses the napkin, and washes down the family flesh with tepid grey water. She anticipates there will be ice cream for dessert, still does not know for certain what the creamy, bitter substance is made of, shudders to think of the possibilities. Sugar and coconut flavoring can only mask so much, and sexual education during class time has robbed her of at least some smidge of naivet\u00e9.\nWhen the family shows up to Worship the following morning there are three animals strategically placed on the stage: a Saanen goat, an albino cow, and a Flemish rabbit. The goat will not lift its head from its water bowl, the cow is wearing a muumuu for some unknown reason, and the rabbit is extra twitchy. The church is not the animals\u2019 natural environment, yet somehow they look like they belong. Jess was hoping for the appearance of a gharial this time, just as she always does, but reptiles are a rarity at Worship and Uncle Ray has promised her again and again that those ugly shits went extinct prior to The Great Reverence. He\u2019s sure of it. Jess ignores Uncle Ray\u2019s rudeness. She believes the gharial is a creature of beauty, of wonder, a crocodile designed as if God had taken design tips from Pablo Picasso. One-hundred-and-ten teeth, and yet Jess has read in some old dusty encyclopedia in the Black Briar Library that there is not a single documented attack on a human. She does not believe they are truly extinct, though. How could there suddenly just be none of something one day? Just like that, snapped out existence? Would the last one even know it was the last? Who would allow any of God\u2019s innocent creatures to pass from this world, and will humans one day be a part of this list? If so, who will be around to take note of it?\nJess will find another gharial. She knows it is her destiny to see one in the scaly flesh. The image of the gharial comes to her in her dreams some nights, smiling its elongated smile, gazing at her with reptilian wisdom.\nJess keeps leaning over to Uncle Ray, asking him in a whispery voice why they can\u2019t eat any of the animals that pass naturally in the world. The ones that were treated like part of the family, bathed weekly, passed around as community idols, medicated into euphoric states. Not that Jess even wants to eat them exactly, but it seems like a waste, she thinks. When Jess\u2019s gerbil Herman went to that Great Runabout in the Sky two months ago, his empty husk was placed on their mantel and a shrine was constructed to honor his sweet life. The smell eventually became too much to bear and Herman was given a proper burial in the side yard, the topsoil sprinkled with lye. Jess always asks Uncle Ray about this waste of perfectly edible meat, and Uncle Ray does his best not to act irritated when he responds. Jojo tells Jess to Shut up \u2018cause she\u2019s a stupid know-nothing ingrate brat, and Uncle Ray says not to question the decisions of God and Government. All will become clear at adulthood. Jess has heard some stories in between class times about those who broke the laws of The Great Reverence, and those weren\u2019t all that pleasant\u2014they made tales of the Spanish Inquisition seem like a senior citizen cruise in the Bahamas, so she thinks maybe she should just listen to Uncle Ray. He\u2019s no dummy. He used to be a senator or a manager or a janitor or something useful like that.\nThere\u2019s a portly preacher man up on stage with the animals. He\u2019s whiter than Frosty\u2019s taint and he\u2019s blowing hard about respecting their superiors, the sentient creatures that have put up with human abuse for so long. His purple robes are tattered and unwashed. Looks like a homeless Grimace, Uncle Ray whispers to Jojo. Jojo bites the edge of his hand so that he does not disrupt Worship with his laughter\u2014drawing blood even, but Jess does not get the joke. Uncle Ray just tells her it was something from before her time. Jess wonders if this Grimace was an Old God, one that will soon return to spread his mighty gospel.\nSome short little cotton-candy-haired old lady in a crinkled paisley tunic kneels in front of the goat, then rises, then brings its damp beard to her lips. Her face is full of glistening tears. It looks like someone filled up a water balloon with her make-up inside and threw it at her face to see how it might come out.\nJess wonders what makes the preacher man pick a particular member of the audience and match them up with one of these beautiful beasts. She simultaneously wishes for and fears this privilege. Will she ever be chosen? And if so, how will it change the course of her young life?\nJojo finds the jokers that took the Mr. Martin meat. Right under their noses, two blocks south on Slater Street. The scavengers had eaten about half of it, including the private parts (which every pamphlet seems to claim are the most nutritious bits, but Jess refuses to try them). The Tyler family passes through a door that is not only unlocked, but barely hanging on its hinges. Uncle Ray and Jojo take the back end of a hammer to each of the thieves\u2019 heads while they are laughing the night away in their mildewed basement, lit up on some homemade hooch. A bootleg videotape plays in the background, some ancient banned television program where an adorable wisecracking alien puppet tries to eat the family cat. Jess observes the scene from the top of the stairs without a sound and feels nothing. Jojo curses about the blood splattered on the new unworn blue jeans he just bartered for.\nUncle Ray and Jojo will not face any prison time for this murderous action. In fact, should they even bother to inform the proper authorities, they might be rewarded with a medal and a meal of choice from the Gourmet District, where the wealthy have many untapped resources and prison slaves. Meat theft is punishable by death, not regulated by the state, so says the Eat Treaty. But Uncle Ray is a humble man. He only wants to provide for his family and keep his home safe. Jojo\u2014not so much. He will likely leak the information to his source at the Print Shop and get his picture in next Sunday\u2019s pamphlet.\nNow the family has rescued the rest of Mr. Martin, the added bonus of the thieves, plus some other flesh of indeterminate origin that was crammed in the back of the thieves\u2019 fridge. The mystery meat is scaly and scabby, but unquestionably human. Any potential disease or contamination will cook right out, any foul tastes can be masked with cumin and garlic powder. The Tyler House freezer is so full that the door barely closes. Jess wonders if\u2014in the old world\u2014it had been a crime to steal from thieves, to reclaim what had been unjustly taken? Jojo tells Jess that Robin Hood was probably gay, because why else would he be worrying about stealing and giving back to the poor when he could just be boinking a babe like Maid Marian? That even in the Disney version, she was a real fox. Jess just shrugs, another reference from the old world lost on her.\nJojo is guarding the stash with his life now. He can forget about his little lady friend for a while unless she stops by for supper some time. Supper in the traditional sense. Traditional in the post Great Reverence sense. More important matters to attend to here. Duty calls.\nOn an overcast Sunday afternoon, Jess and Uncle Ray make a trip to the farmer\u2019s market. Chickens trot freely amongst the people as if they have their own shopping agenda, so many crowded into some spots that their loose feathers in the air appear to be the result of an impromptu pillow fight. Their clucking is metronomic, trance-inducing. Jess stops at a booth where a husband, wife, and son are selling their family flesh. Each of them is missing some piece that was once aesthetically necessary or even quite useful, but not essential to survival. An earlobe, the tip of a nose, a tongue, a finger or two. Jess stares at the son. He is around her age and, strangely, is missing exactly the same fingers on exactly the same hand as she. She feels something stir within her, a kinship-gone-crush that she refuses to vocalize, but they at least exchange crooked smiles. The boy has only a handful of teeth left. Enamel is a precious bargaining chip in these times.\nJess spies an old woman behind the family, what remains of her slumped in a wheelchair. She is a quadruple amputee, also missing much of her face and appears to have had a double mastectomy. Now that Jess\u2019s own breasts are beginning to develop, she wonders if and when they will be large enough to become a useful commodity. To offer the purest of milk to all those who seek it. Uncle Ray has already been underlining passages from the Breast section of the Eat Treaty. A cream-colored substance oozes from the old woman\u2019s nasal cavity and a fly hungrily rubs its legs together in the curve of her remaining lip. The fly seems to be well aware that the old woman cannot swat it. Jess studies the woman clinically. She presumes the family made a decision that Gramma had lived the longest life and therefore should be the first to be sold off at the market so that the rest of the family might thrive for a few more weeks. Jess knows this because her own Gramma went through the same process when Jess was still a toddler. She does not remember this, but Uncle Ray brings the fact up more than is necessary.\nJess sees an emaciated, androgynous child peddling professionally bagged samples of rat droppings. She barters a piece of flesh that once belonged to the thieves, a tiny, lean patch that she has hidden from Uncle Ray all morning, knowing that trading for this bag of droppings will put her in Jojo\u2019s good graces when she gifts it to him. Jojo and his girlfriend snort the precious droppings on special occasions, and their anniversary is coming up. The droppings offer some strange level of high that Jess is curious about, but not curious enough to pilfer any of the droppings for herself. Her body is a temple and no waste shall enter its gates.\nUncle Ray purchases a bag of oranges because he claims Jojo has been deficient in his Vitamin C consumption lately and is at risk for scurvy. That is all the currency they have for today. As they leave the market, there are true vegetarian protestors politely picketing off to the side so as not to actually obstruct any foot traffic. They wield signs that say ALL MEAT IS SACRED\u2014DON\u2019T EAT SOMEONE WHO COULD BE THE NEXT EINSTEIN OR MLK OR POL POT and A WORLD WITHOUT MEAT=A WORLD REALLY NEAT. Jess is curious as to why they would not picket the entrance, as people leaving have already made their purchases and made up their minds. But she sees worth in their cause, will sneak away from home one day when Uncle Ray is in a drunken coma and come attempt to learn more, maybe even join in the protest if she feels it worth the effort.\nJess attends Worship by herself the following Sunday. Uncle Ray is taking care of Jojo, who has come down with a case of something that may or may not be chicken pox. She stops by the market to speak to the meat-free protestors, but is disillusioned by the fact that most of them appear to be taking a break and drinking some milky beverage made of flaxseed. So she moves on for now. At the church, the pews are near empty, perhaps because there is a Sacrifice Lottery on the other side of town. Everyone wants to know who will be next obese denizen to be consumed in the communal feast, but Jess just rolls her eyes at the thought.\nThe purple priest is reading rewritten Leviticus passages, practically singing them in a bouncing ball cadence. He has an almost beautiful and soothing voice, like an angel\u2019s harp that is slightly out of key. Nothing matters until the animals are brought out to gaze upon. An alpaca with its fur dyed blue, a Pug\/Shih Tzu mix in a too tiny pink t-shirt that says \u201cLil\u2019 Princess,\u201d and\u2014\nJess\u2019s solo attendance today is like sweet serendipity, for the third animal that now sits on the stage is everything she has hoped for. She immediately recognizes that long, thin maw lined with jagged razors, that cold stare that burrows into her soul.\nA gharial.\nThe last gharial, or one of many\u2014this does not matter at this moment. What matters is the existence of such a creature at all. Extinction is a myth that can be disproven with just one subject.\nThe priest notices Jess\u2019s excitement, makes eye contact with her, and beckons to her. It is as if he has been holding out for this very moment, taunting her for months upon years with the fact that she was not worthy. That there are not many attendees to choose from this particular Sunday is beside the point. This is Jess\u2019s time to shine.\nShe approaches the stage. She is trembling, but she does not give a single damn. The gharial is indifferent to her approach, but Jess expects this. A gharial is not a Golden Retriever waiting patiently for its human companion to return home so that it may lick upon his or her face. A gharial is cold and calculating, but it is still beautiful.\nIt is the closest thing to God that Jess has ever known.\nJess reaches out her hand with the missing fingers, knowing that the likelihood of losing the fingers on her other hand is slim, but still possible. Those teeth do not lie.\nThe old scars along her arm are stripped in perfect indented lines like tribal tattoos. She reaches, she approaches. The gharial seems to be almost sleeping, probably dreaming of the gorgeous swamp it calls home and the plentiful fish that only it is allowed to consume without repercussion.\nJess kneels before the gharial, her finger stumps twitching, her destiny fulfilled.\nChad Stroup received his MFA in Fiction from San Diego State University.

Their feet weren\u2019t quite covered with water yet, and one of them, the smallest girl, skipped backward when a wave came near. Neri didn\u2019t know if the child was frightened of the water or if she was just remembering how to play. She couldn\u2019t tell from her expression: the little girl was blank all over. Even the crowd on the beach behind made no impression her \u2013 she pressed against her new parents, arms so firmly wrapped around a stuffed toy that only the barest hint of green feathers, of beak, poked through the gap between elbows.\nSahir stood in the water beside her. They were almost exactly the same height, so when Neri turned to him to check if he was ready, if he was happy, she could look him right in the eye.\n\u201cI want to be the one to go first,\u201d he\u2019d said to her. \u201cI want the children to see there\u2019s nothing to fear.\u201d He was a kind man who would have offered for any of the kids, Neri thought, but his concern was mostly for his own son, and for the little girl with the toy k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d.\n\u201cThere is nothing to fear,\u201d Wiremu had told him. The principal of the neighbourhood school, he was also involved in the ceremony; most of the newcomers would be under his care and he wanted to show himself available to them even before the official welcome of citizenship. \u201cBut it is a good thing for you to do regardless. And all the elders will be with you, supporting you.\u201d\nThose elders were ranged behind, a half-circle standing in the sea that merged at the waterline with the crowd onshore. \u201cWe want you to feel supported,\u201d said Neri.\nShe\u2019d met them for the first time at the settlement centre in M\u0101ngere. The primary hub for refugee services, it housed new arrivals for the first two months of their residence, providing medical care, orientation, and tuition in the basic ecological principles of the nation. It was the duty of midwives to confer citizenship, so when she had been informed that her community was due for new arrivals Neri had gone to meet them at M\u0101ngere. It was her turn, and although the refugees could have, in theory, been escorted by workers from the centre, in practice people from the new community were sent to them, so that the newcomers would feel welcomed from the beginning.\nThe little girl had worried her from the moment she set eyes on her.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a child so silent,\u201d she said. And so still. The most movement Neri ever saw from her, unprompted, was the tightening of small arms around a stuffed k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d whenever someone got too close.\n\u201cYou might have a bit of trouble with the water, there,\u201d said Nyaring\u2019s case worker.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll manage,\u201d said Neri. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d Many of the refugees had reached the remainder of the UNHCR camps on boats, long and perilous journeys that frequently resulted in dehydration and death. It had left some of them suspicious of oceans, with a horror of water, and it was hard for her to comprehend the loss.\nSahir and his young son, 12 year old Syrus, had come the furthest \u2013 a long and painful journey from the obliterated remains of Damascus. They\u2019d come south, the boat crowded and stinking and leaky, and on it there\u2019d been a Sudanese family but the parents had died of starvation and their little girl left alone. She should have died, but Sahir had refused to allow it, for months had fed her most of his own meagre ration. \u201cIf it were my boy,\u201d he said, \u201cI would have wanted someone to help. She was only a child.\u201d\nIt was the relationship between them that had caused the refugees to stay at M\u0101ngere a little longer than usual. It wasn\u2019t just Sahir and the two children who were coming to Neri\u2019s small seaside community. There was a mother and grandmother from Tuvalu who had a little boy in need of serious long-term medical support that their own floating nation could no longer supply; two orphaned teenage girls from flooded Bangladesh, an Eritrean man with his elderly parents. \u201cI feel bad that we are keeping them back,\u201d said Sahir, but \u201cIt\u2019s not for long,\u201d said Neri. \u201cAnd it\u2019s better for you all to travel together now you\u2019ve got to know each other. That way you can share the ceremony.\u201d\nNyaring had been placed with a couple Neri knew well \u2013 the woman a child psychologist, the man a paediatric nurse \u2013 who had successfully raised a child to responsible adulthood already and who had the experience to best help the little girl. Once they had visited Nyaring at the centre and realised her attachment to Sahir \u2013 and especially to Syrus \u2013 they had insisted on moving their household so that the two families would be neighbours. It meant a slightly longer stay in M\u0101ngere for the little group while housing was rearranged but no-one who knew Nyaring objected.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be good for her to have an established support structure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d take her myself if I could,\u201d said Sahir, but he had one child to raise already, a new country to adapt to, and he was suffering himself from the effects of trauma and prolonged and severe malnutrition. Shifting the new family next door to the old was felt to be the best solution. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that they have to give up their old home.\u201d It was a plaintive reminder that he had had to leave his own.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Neri. \u201cNyaring is to be their daughter. There\u2019s nothing they wouldn\u2019t do to make her happy. A house move is the least of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou have already studied the ceremonies surrounding birth,\u201d her instructor had said, and after her training was over Neri had performed them often enough. An infant\u2019s naming ceremony, the acknowledgement of their right to citizenship, came with the first formal touch of sea water. \u201cThis ceremony is adapted for newcomers. For children, it is much the same. Those who are capable of understanding are asked to do their best and try hard, to undertake the responsibility of kindness and kinship with the ocean. In practice, though, that responsibility lies primarily with their care-givers who, as with birth citizens, have the task of teaching those values to the young person. But for adults who are becoming citizens, the ceremony is slightly different. They are capable of greater understanding, and this is reflected in the wording.\u201d\nHer hands were wet with sea water. Neri placed one palm on his forehead, the other over his heart. \u201cSahir of Syria,\u201d she said, formal in her incantation. \u201cYou stand in the waters of our home. A community stands with you, willing to make it yours as well. You are welcome here. Our consent is freely given.\n\u201cWith this citizenship you do not give up your first home. The ocean that surrounds Aotearoa stretches across the world, and our waters mix with the waters of other countries, other places.\u201d\nPerhaps one day he would return to his first home, help to put into practice the conservation skills he would learn in this one. Perhaps he never would. It didn\u2019t really matter to Neri; that wasn\u2019t her choice to make.\n\u201cCitizenship comes with responsibility as well as rights. Our country has learned, through hard experience and hard choices, that a community cannot be strong if its ecology is not. We are an island nation. The ocean is our shared origin. It is our shared responsibility; it is our only legacy. Do you understand and accept this belief? Will you hold to it as your own?\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Sahir. Neri could see him swallow hard, could feel him shaking under her hands but his voice was clear, and loud enough to be heard along the beach.\nShe pushed him down, gentle. \u201cThen let the waters of our shared home witness your oath.\u201d He was under for only a moment, and when he rose out of the water to stand again before her, she said the binding words. \u201cBy the power vested in me by position and community consent, I declare this man Sahir to be a citizen of Aotearoa.\u201d Neri grinned at him. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said, giving him the first welcome embrace as the clapping began.\nCitizenship was one of the duties of midwifery that had evolved away from the traditional responsibilities of birth. \u201cThough of course it is a birth, in a way,\u201d one of her instructors had said. \u201cA rebirth at least, and metaphorical.\u201d\nThe fall in birth rate, the firmly established responsibility of one-child families in a world defined by ecological devastation, had demographic consequences that were mitigated by migration, by the welcoming of refugees from countries whose ecology could no longer support them. Aotearoa had its own carrying capacity; and one country devoted to conservation, to the preservation of its own marine environment, could not take all comers \u2013 but it could take some. That was where the midwives came in.\n\u201cThe people who come here will have different histories, different needs,\u201d Neri had been taught. \u201cBut they will all, in some ways, be suffering from trauma. Even a difficult homeland is a home, and having to leave \u2013 even if it\u2019s to ensure survival \u2013 is leaving not only a country but a culture. Ours will in many ways be a strange one to them,\u201d and that strangeness was most often expressed in the priority given to conservation. There were two main reactions \u2013 those who fell into it easily, having seen the wastelands behind and wanting to work to ensure the future home would never suffer similarly. There were those, also, who had more difficulty adapting, who saw a new country and the ability to fulfil the dreams that had been so destructive and impossible in the old \u2013 a large family, a wasteful way of life. There had been difficulties \u2013 unfriendly reactions to those who came with multiple children, the fear that the national character would be influenced over generations, sent back to profligacy and overburdened ecology. Resentment from those who wanted more than one child themselves, and had curbed that wanting for the greater good. \u201cWhy should they have more children than us, when we\u2019re the ones who are doing the right thing?\u201d But it wasn\u2019t a just a question of environmental irresponsibility. There was the acknowledgement, too, that many of those who had more than one child did so because of the lack of contraception available in conflict zones, or as a result of the high probability of sexual assault in the staggering, over-burdened camps. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky here. We\u2019ve got decent medical care, enough resources to ensure a peaceful home where people can be safe. We can\u2019t punish others for not having those advantages.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not punishment to be selective. We know we can\u2019t take everyone. So many people are displaced.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t stand by and do nothing. But we can\u2019t forget that the only reason we can act now is because we made the decision, as a nation, to put ecology first. If we go back on that we\u2019ll end up like everyone else \u2013 living in a wasteland, and all our oceans empty. They\u2019re only just now beginning to recover.\u201d\nBefore Neri\u2019s own birth there had been discussions, symposia, the second great national debate after the M\u0101ori Queen and the Prime Minister had pushed through the first and enshrined conservation as a national \u2013 as the national \u2013 ideal. How to best balance welcoming refugees \u2013 people in desperate need of safe harbour \u2013 and the desire to prove, as a nation, a compassionate one against what had come to be seen as the primary duty of citizenry: conservation, and the protection of the oceans so dear to the interests of an island country.\nThe consensus, at the end, after neighbourhoods and iwi and community groups had had their say, was the protection of the most vulnerable individuals. It was a reflection of the concern for the most vulnerable environment, and the pairing was a popular one. \u201cIt felt right,\u201d said Neri\u2019s instructor. \u201cNot perfect, but something everyone could live with.\u201d The primary focus \u2013 though not the only one \u2013 was on children, on the many orphaned overseas by devastated ecology; by rising sea levels and lack of food, of clean water; by desertification and poison and sterility. The young could learn the most easily. They could be taught to love the ocean and the land in a way that would immunise them from the temptation to exploit it.\n\u201cRemember these people have been through a lot,\u201d said the instructor. \u201cIt\u2019s not your job as midwives to help them adjust to their new life, at least no more than an ordinary citizen. We all have that responsibility, and beyond that there are people trained to help with the specifics. With medical care and schooling and language lessons, for instance.\n\u201cYour job is ceremonial. Your job is to give the first sense of stability. There was a time when refugees remained non-citizens, often for years. We believe today that early citizenship helps to ensure a feeling of security, and allows the individual to develop from the beginning the understanding that they are a legitimate stakeholder in the ecology of the country. Furthermore, if this citizenship is taken up before the community, when the individual first becomes resident in that community, the citizenship ceremony is a public declaration that the newcomer has the same rights and responsibilities as the residents. Plus, you know, there\u2019s usually a party.\u201d\nThere was a party alright. Neri could see the balloons and welcome banners already set up in the park beside the beach. There was a barbecue ready to go, vegetable kebabs waiting to be grilled and the h\u0101ngi had nearly finished cooking in a freshly dug pit. Everyone had brought a plate \u2013 salads and cheeses and sweets, cakes with friendly messages piped onto them, the traditional sweet fish \u2013 honey now instead of the once usual chocolate, for honey was locally produced and could be easily sourced \u2013 and even a platter of smoked, for the sea was part of island life and it was the smoked fish that would be served at the beginning of the meal, small shreds offered to everyone but for this day the newcomers first.\nThe picnic tables had cloths draped over them to keep the insects off while the ceremony took place. There were chilly bins full of drinks and ice blocks for the heat, ginger beer and craft beer and cold white wine. There were umbrellas set up and blankets set out and she\u2019d already seen Syrus eyeing up the cricket set some of the neighbourhood kids had brought along. There was a table of gifts as well, gifts from each household, to each new household. Books, toys, items useful for the new home. One man famed for his preserves had given a pretty box of jams and chutneys to each family; a woman known for her artistic ability had given paintings. A textiles club run out of the local marae had made quilts; Wiremu had quietly organised school uniforms and sports equipment. There was music too, although that had been turned off for the meantime for there was usually singing in the citizenship ceremony. Karanga and waiata, the new national anthem, songs from the past that had stayed popular \u2013 Welcome Home was a favourite, something everyone could sing to and it felt apt; Neri saw some of the people on the beach with their guitars, ready to participate.\nSahir in the water beside her, trembling. There were tears in his eyes. \u201cYou alright mate?\u201d she said, under her breath.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day for me as well,\u201d Neri replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe rest of the refugees followed, until only Nyaring was left. The little girl clung to her new mother, clearly unwilling to walk into the ocean.\n\u201cI think she\u2019s afraid of the water.\u201d Neri didn\u2019t see the person who called out, only knew it was someone from the crowd and it was nothing that she hadn\u2019t thought herself, watching the little face staring out at her, at Sahir and the other newcomers waiting in the waves, their own salt baptisms completed.\nThe crowd murmured, sympathetic. There\u2019d been a neighbourhood meeting, before the refugees came, where all those who were to live near the newcomers were briefed on their origins and their journeys. It was a delicate balance, the preservation of privacy against the desire to have a useful support system in place, but Neri was grateful for it now. Nyaring would have to have the water over her to legally bind her belonging but there was no need to compound her trauma. The ocean was supposed to be a home instead of a reminder of harm done and gone. Frightening the child further would not encourage her to love it, and fear was anathema to conservation.\nSahir clutched at her arm. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to come,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s only little. Please don\u2019t make her.\u201d\n\u201cOf course we won\u2019t,\u201d said Neri, shocked enough at the suggestion that words of explanation caught in her throat and wedged there like kina in a rocky crevice. Then Wiremu was wading up from the half-circle behind, and he set one big, hand on Sahir\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not such sticklers we can\u2019t adapt for cause. Just move forward a bit, you\u2019ll see.\u201d He pushed gently, propelling Sahir forward and Neri flanked his other side, the three of them moving together until the water fell below their hips, below their thighs, below even their ankles. When they finally stopped it was at the edge of waves, still in the ocean if only the fringes of it, with salt water licking up against their heels, washing briefly over toes.\nNeri watched the men and women and children behind her come forward as well, the half-circle of them come up close behind, their faces friendly as their bodies cut off the sight of waves, the wide expanse of water and horizon. She watched Sahir as well, saw his shoulders loosen as he understood, as he watched the support behind and in front for the crowd on the beach was moving in closer too, surrounding the little girl and her new family, close enough to offer small words of encouragement but careful not to overwhelm her.\nGrunting, Wiremu knelt in front of the child, drenched in salt water from the shoulders down and the wet sand squelched beneath him. \u201cKia kaha, little one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very nice bird you\u2019ve got there. Does he have a name?\u201d\nNyaring just stared at him, but Wiremu waited, patient in the ocean. The little girl looked at Sahir then, at her foster brother, and finally twisted her head up towards her mother, shrinking back against the woman\u2019s dress.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t feel like talking yet,\u201d said Syrus. He\u2019d been standing close by, dark curls plastered to his head. He had a smudge of sand on one cheek. \u201cBut she\u2019s still thinking about a name. He doesn\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\nWiremu nodded, his face solemn. \u201cNames take a lot of thinking about. It\u2019s a serious thing, to give a name to a friend.\u201d He leaned forward a little, so that Nyaring would know his words were for her. \u201cYou are right to take your time.\u201d\nNeri knelt down beside him. \u201cMay we see your friend?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to say hello.\u201d She\u2019d met the toy before, been allowed to stroke him on the long trip from the refugee centre. \u201cI think you\u2019d like him,\u201d she said to Wiremu, conversational.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I would.\u201d\n\u201cNever met a bird he didn\u2019t like!\u201d someone called from the beach, and laughter rippled round. \u201cLeast we can be sure this one won\u2019t end up in the pot!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention, moko,\u201d Wiremu said, laughing himself. \u201cThey\u2019re just jealous because they don\u2019t have a fine big k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d like you do. He must be very brave too, to be here with you.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d don\u2019t like water much either?\u201d said Neri. \u201cThey can still swim a little if they have to, though.\u201d\n\u201cI knew a k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d once who saw his human friends swimming and jumped right in after them!\u201d said Wiremu. \u201cThey must have looked like they were having fun for him to join them like that.\u201d\n\u201cHe must have been a very brave k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d,\u201d said Sahir. \u201cBrave like Syrus, to go into the water when he wasn\u2019t used to it.\u201d\nIt seemed like those were the magic words, thought Neri, for if Nyaring didn\u2019t love the ocean yet she did love Syrus, who was the only other person Neri had ever seen who was allowed to hold the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d. Nothing Syrus did could ever be bad, and the stuffed feathery head began to surface, peeking out from two little arms.\n\u201cThere he is, eh?\u201d said Wiremu. \u201cWhat a handsome k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d! Just look at him, staring at me, making sure that everything is safe for you. I knew that he was brave.\u201d\nNyaring nodded, hesitating.\n\u201cWould you like him to go first, Nyaring?\u201d said Neri. \u201cThat way the two of you will belong together and no-one can ever take either of you away. You will be home together.\u201d The little girl still looked sceptical, so she kept talking. \u201cHe won\u2019t have to go all the way under the water. We\u2019ll just sprinkle a little over his head. Just because he is a brave k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d doesn\u2019t mean he has to be very brave k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d all at once.\u201d\n\u201cYou can hold him while they do it,\u201d said Syrus. \u201cCan\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nOne of the women standing behind Neri had a polished p\u0101ua shell hanging around her neck. She dipped it in the water and passed the shell forward. When Nyaring held out the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d a little way, still looking only half-convinced, Neri smiled at her. \u201cDo you promise to look after your k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d?\u201d she said. \u201cDo you promise to raise him to be a good k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, to help him to work and learn, and will you teach him that he is only a part of the world and that every part of it is important?\u201d It was not quite the same as she had said for the others, but she wanted to make sure that the little girl got the gist of it correctly, that she felt the early responsibility of kindness and conservation.\nWhen Nyaring nodded, Neri held the p\u0101ua over the stuffed toy and let a little, a very little seawater trickle down over the plush head. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the power vested in me by position and community, I declare that this k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d is a citizen of Aotearoa, that he belongs to us and that this is his home for as long as he wants it and that no-one can take him away from it ever.\u201d\nFor a moment she worried that the response wouldn\u2019t come, or if it did there would be a fake solemnity that Nyaring would hear beneath the surface \u2013 something that would discomfort her and make her think that people were making fun. It was a foolish worry, for the smiles and clapping came as quickly for the little toy as it had for the people, and underneath was nothing but compassion and hopeful expectation.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d she said. \u201cWould you like me to do you now?\u201d\nWhen the little girl nodded, Neri held the p\u0101ua shell over her head.

G. Ballard foresees many of the more drastic effects of climate change on our environment: rising seas, increased temperatures, mass extinction. And yet, amidst these climate-centric predictions, Ballard also offers a prediction for the changes wrought on the human psyche during times of extreme environmental shifting. Kerans, the crew-cut marine biologist who serves as the protagonist of The Drowned World, has a revelation in which he loses \u201cany division between the real and the super-real in the external world. Phantoms slid imperceptibly from nightmare to reality and back again, the terrestrial and psychic landscapes were now indistinguishable, as they had been at Hiroshima and Auschwitz, Golgotha and Gomorrah\u201d (89). The vision here is one in which our deepest nightmares have manifested in the changing Earth\u2014there is no longer a distinction between the fantastical and the real. The body and the earth have become one, and the imagination is only the extension of reality\u2014and vice versa. This is Ballard\u2019s future, and it is, in many ways, our present.\nIn this essay, I will suggest that texts like Ballard\u2019s\u2014pieces of imaginative and speculative literature\u2014offer readers and writers necessary tools to combat climate change and prime our cultural minds to take action. It is no overstatement to say climate change and environmental destruction are hugely important issues today: scientific reports regularly show the poles heating, once-in-a-century storms happening far too frequently, and an ever-heightening temperature for the hottest months on record. We are in a crisis, and as the history of the written word shows, literature is one key forum through which people in a crisis express and manage anxiety, hope, and fear. Speculative literature is a necessary part of that discussion, in part because of the scope and importance of its fearless imagination, in part because of the specific craft tools it has long made use of and perfected, and in part because of the fundamental questions at the heart of speculative literature: What if? Why? What\u2019s possible? And who are we in the impossible times?\nA Short Note on Terms, Genres, and Divisions\nMuch has been written about the distinctions between speculative literature and literature, between fantasy and science fiction, between pulp and Art. Indeed, any conversation about speculative literature seems to unavoidably fall into the ruts of us vs. them in an unending bout of essentialisms and misunderstandings. For the purposes of this essay, I\u2019ve chose to use speculative literature as my designator for the subset of writing referred to as genre, pulp, science fiction, fantasy, Weird fiction, and horror.\nI have borrowed slightly from Margaret Atwood in this naming convention. She has pushed against the label of \u201cscience fiction\u201d for her own work, preferring \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d instead because, as she says, \u201cScience fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen\u201d (Atwood, \u201cLight in the Wilderness\u201d). While I respect Atwood\u2019s ability and right to label her writing however she sees fit, it will be my pleasure in this essay to suggest that now, perhaps more than ever, we need the kinds of literature with monsters and spaceships, not only because they could actually happen, but because they are, in some very true ways, already happening. The monsters of fantasy have always been, at their best, physical manifestations of the monsters we fight and try to understand in our lives. As for spaceships, well, Elon Musk\u2019s plans for Mars are the science fictional story-stuff of many novels, pulp or otherwise.\nThe Responsibility of Literature in the Anthropocene\nMuch has been written recently about the responsibilities of authors and fiction in the Anthropocene. Nick Admussen, at The Critical Flame, offers \u201cSix Proposals for the Reform of Literature in the Age of Climate Change,\u201d including retiring the heroic individual trope and avoiding the rampant anthropomorphization of the natural world in order to better serve humanity.\nSimilarly, renowned novelist Amitav Ghosh\u2019s new book, The Great Derangement, wonders where the traumatic and powerful literature of climate change is. The dilemma, he believes, is in the modernization of literature. Modern literature, he suggests, has \u201cnever been forced to confront the centrality of the improbable,\u201d which is to say the modern literary novel doesn\u2019t have the machinery to accurately record the freak storms and seemingly impossible occurrences that have become regularities in this climate-changing world (23). To court true improbability in this way, according to Ghosh, would risk \u201ceviction from the mansion in which serious fiction has long been in residence; it is to risk banishment to the humbler dwellings that surround the manor house\u2014those generic outhouses\u201d (24).\nLeaving aside the frustratingly misinformed and insulting characterization of genre literature as unserious and the stuff of outhouses, Ghosh\u2019s larger point is surprisingly accurate: modern literary fiction is too dependent on a reality that could only happen in novels, in a world in which everything has great meaning and importance, in which setting works to unveil character and happenstance is always part of the larger machinations of theme and metaphor. He wants literature to stare the impossible in the eye and record it, and yet he seems afraid to besmirch literature with anything so gauche as genre. However, with a better understanding of what speculative literature can offer and a less exclusive, elitist vision of what can and can\u2019t be literature, Ghosh and other writers can find precisely the tools they seek, the impossibility and improbability they desire.\nMeanwhile, we are already living in a speculative world if the reports are to be believed\u2014Ballard\u2019s world, the one in which reality and our speculative imaginings are blending together, eliding in both wonderful and terrifying ways. For instance, Pulitzer-Prize-winning naturalist and author E. O. Wilson writes in Half-Earth that we need to dedicate half of the Earth\u2019s surface to nature as a way to stave off the huge extinction rates and save what little of nature\u2019s complexity remains.[1] And I\u2019ll be damned if that doesn\u2019t sound like the premise of a science fiction novel being discussed by a serious environmental thinker in a serious non-fiction text.\nThese kinds of arguments and revelations about the natural world are everywhere: stories about trees communicating with one another that are reminiscent of the trees of Narnia that might be on the White Witch\u2019s side, or Alice\u2019s wish for a flower that could talk in Through the Looking Glass. Desertification expands the edges of known deserts and our world looks more and more like that of Mad Max. Oceans rise and threaten the Maldives with becoming a modern-day Atlantis. All over we see an elision of the real world and events so often consigned to the outhouses of speculation and imagination. Indeed, it\u2019s time we start seeing speculative literature as the work of reality.\nBut how specifically does speculation and imagination recover the reality of our climate and world? How do these often-marginalized genres deal in Truth even while they eschew truth?\nSurviving in a Science Fictional World\nScience fiction has long been the easier sell to convince audiences that a book has Serious and Important Value. Science fiction, after all, is based in science, right? It\u2019s an extrapolation of what already exists to what could, to varying degrees of conceivability, exist in 50 or 100 years. It\u2019s a creative hypothesis. As Ann and Jeff VanderMeer say in their introduction to The Big Book of Science Fiction, \u201cScience fiction lives in the future\u201d (xvi). And yet, just as truthfully, science fiction lives in the present, which is very often influenced by our creative and speculative hypotheses about the future. Take, for instance, the recent attempts by Elon Musk\u2019s company, SpaceX, to create a program to travel to and colonize Mars. Not only is this the story-stuff of so many science fiction novels, the ethics behind it\u2014the processes and decisions we weigh and deliberate over\u2014are much more importantly the stuff of science fiction stories. Robert Heinlein\u2019s famous Stranger in a Strange Land discusses precisely the kind of cultural chasm that might open if we split the human population between Earth and Mars. Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s Mars Trilogy explores the terraforming, colonization, and cultural settling of Mars over several generations\u2014a process humanity may be going through very soon. These stories may have begun as interesting thought experiments, but they have become cultural and ethical touchstones as our technology offers us the opportunity to follow in science fiction\u2019s footsteps.\nAlong with these ethical questions, science fiction offers narratives of who we might be in those possible futures. J.G. Ballard gets the causes for climate change wrong, the effects of it eerily right, but he\u2019s most interested in examining what people look and act like in this future. Ballard extrapolates a humanity that, when faced with an ever-warming climate and monsoon-created lagoons filled with giant lizards, humanity will revert\u2014existentially and biologically\u2014back down the food chain to where we began as relatively inefficient mammals. Certainly we don\u2019t have the huge lizards yet and yes the weather is still clement enough to support civilization and social structures, but Ballard\u2019s deeper point showcases the predictive power of science fiction: that we are inextricably linked to our environment, and any fundamental change in nature will result in a fundamental change (or reversion) in us.\nThe case for science fiction has been made before and will continue to be made by better-equipped people than me (Le Guin, for instance, in her introduction to The Left Hand of Darkness, makes a wonderful case for science fiction as not (just) predictive but descriptive). The tools of fantasy, though, are another story. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve spent much of my life in academia, but I so often hear fantasy described as the often-pejorative \u201cescapist\u201d literature for many, an opportunity to avoid the real perils of the world in favor of simpler lives and simpler environments. Dragons over taxes, magic over mortgages.\nFantasy, Weirdness, Misdirection, and Metaphor\nWhen applying for MFA programs, I wrote a personal statement that tried to get at the question of what fantasy (and science fiction to a lesser extent) was for me as a writer and reader. I wrote about how my \u201cformative reading experiences taught me that these genres, though often marginalized in academic and literary circles, can and do offer tools that are both provocative and powerful.\u201d But honesty, I don\u2019t know that I had any concrete idea what those specific tools were when I wrote that sentence. It sounded nice and academic-y, so I threw it in and moved on.\nLike a lot of readers of fantasy, I have an intuition that the stuff I read is important and useful beyond simple escapism\u2014though I do also believe strongly that escape is no small or silly benefit. But what does importance look like? What does fantasy do? Neil Gaiman, in his review of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Buried Giant, suggests fantasy \u201cis a way of making our metaphors concrete, and it shades into myth in one direction, allegory in another[2]\u201d (Gaiman, \u201cKazuo Ishiguro\u2019s \u2018The Buried Giant\u2019). Jim C. Hines, over at Uncanny Magazine, points out that \u201cPolitics have always been an intrinsic part of our genre,\u201d especially the politics of power (Hines, \u201cThe Politics of Comfort\u201d). These two are talking about the ways in which fantasy is, at its heart, a genre just as focused on the real world as any other kind of fiction. Any escapism fantasy provides is simply one half of the equation; the other half is to turn around from a new vantage point and better see and understand your world, your reality. We can even see Shakespeare hip to this particular technique; in Hamlet, he has Polonius say:\nYour bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;\nAnd thus do we of wisdom and of reach,\nWith windlasses and with assays of bias,\nBy indirections find directions out. (2.1.63\u201366)\nOf course, this moment is one of scheming and not-so-altruistic motivations, but the idea holds: we lie a little to better understand the Truth. We talk about things that aren\u2019t in order to better see the things that are. We read and write fantasies to better understand reality.\nI\u2019m someone who often thinks almost exclusively in simile, probably thanks to reading The Chronicles of Prydain so much as a kid and wanting desperately to be as smart or as cool or as self-assured as Eilonwy, Princess of Llyr and purveyor of fine similes. Similes, I learned from that young age, are the creation of connections where they didn\u2019t always exist, and fantasy literature is damn good at bringing them into being. We might read Harry Potter, which features characters dealing with seemingly irrelevant and unrealistic (in the sense that we don\u2019t have this in the real world) discrimination based on being muggle or wizard-born, and we can say, \u201cHey, that really subtle system of discrimination that asks us to think differently about these two groups of people based on a completely arbitrary set of criteria is just like the whole Pureblood vs. Half-blood vs. Mudblood thing in Harry Potter.\u201d That kind of rhetorical move is important\u2014for a younger audience, yes, but the same framework, the same technique, is used by and is important for adults as well. This is how we begin to understand complex, scientific ideas if we\u2019re not scientists. We make up a simile to crack into understanding, to jumpstart the process.\nThis is precisely what Larry Niven does with his first-short-story-then-novella The Magic Goes Away, in which magic is imagined as a finite resource. The appearance of the short story only three years after the 1973 oil crisis is certainly not an accident. Of course, the question we might ask is this: why not just talk about the very real problem of the oil crisis without the layer of metaphor? Why distract readers with talk of The Warlock and mana?\nOne answer, of course, is Shakespeare\u2019s: we can better discern the truth of the situation by indirect approaches. Perhaps this is because the baggage (political, social, cultural) we often bring to important discussions is gone\u2014or at least distant\u2014when we use metaphor. We don\u2019t have to be Democrats or Republicans talking about oil prices or rising sea levels; we have the sheer freedom of being readers swept up in another character\u2019s life in another world, and any connections we can make to our world\u2014probably the most important and deeply impactful connections\u2014are seeded for a later bloom. So when we\u2019re reading the report about another stretch of rainforest turned into suburban homes or listening to the news of the novel and spectacular ways California has managed to mishandle and destroy its water resources, Niven\u2019s text allows us to understand and respond to that news in complex ways that have already pulled us out of our political torpor and inertia, at least a little bit.\nBut metaphor isn\u2019t the only speculative tool we can use to understand the environment and our relationship with it. Weird fiction (and it\u2019s modern, marketed iteration, New Weird fiction), a progeny of Lovecraft\u2019s strangeness, provides a compelling tool for further exploring the natural world in fiction. Put simply, Weird fiction contends with the unknown to both suggest a fundamental unknowability within the world and demonstrate a way to live in such conditions. Let\u2019s take as evidence Annihilation, Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s novel about an expedition team exploring a pristine wilderness that simply appeared on an unspecified coast in, presumably, North America. This book was written after the BP gulf oil spill but VanderMeer transplants that real-world terror into a different environment that, while aesthetically pleasing, operates on an impossible and illogical system of logic.[3] A great tower built in the ground\u2014sunken below but still recognizably a tower\u2014is filled with strange writing on the walls made up of tiny, unidentifiable fungi. Evidence of weird creatures is everywhere, trails of what seem to be sloughed off human faces move through a swampy area, and a lighthouse near the shore holds horrible secrets. All of this weirdness works to capture the haunting fear of the oil spill while simultaneously providing a clean, clear space through which to break down our changing relationship with nature, with ourselves, and with any sense of nature we have left. VanderMeer settles on tension and calmly maintains illogic and lack of meaning, and this, I argue, is one of the tools speculative fiction can offer: the ability to tell a story, get wrapped up in the world and in systems that support that world without the need to narrativize everything, give it meaning and character purpose and symbolic value. Trees can simply be trees in VanderMeer\u2019s world, and somehow, the weirder he makes them, the more they seem to reclaim their own value. This kind of speculative fiction\u2014focusing less on the world working to unpack character and more on the character working to unpack the world\u2014is precisely what we need today.\nWorldbuilding\nBut speculative fiction isn\u2019t just good for helping us begin to understand environmental issues; it\u2019s also an important ingredient in generating possible solutions. That might be nuts if we didn\u2019t live in a speculative world already where we scour the universe for possible planets to support us and have technology so advanced it might as well be magic for how much the average person truly understands how it works.\nIn her article about the effects of rising sea levels around southern Florida, Elizabeth Kolbert spends some time with Bruce Mowry, who is Miami Beach\u2019s city engineer\u2014the person, as she says, who, if \u201cMiami Beach is on a gurney, then Mowry might be said to be thumping its chest\u201d (49). Kolbert details the terrible effects of Miami Beach\u2019s very real flooding\/rising sea level problem, and then, curiously, she quotes Mowry\u2019s whimsical wishes for his fixes to this problem: a resin that could somehow be injected into limestone (on which Miami Beach is built and through which water floods up) that would seal the holes, a requirement for builders of the city to lay down a waterproof shield beneath all new houses (like a tarp under a tent), or a kind of clay that could be pumped into the ground and seal up the gaps. Kolbert finds herself thinking \u201cof Calvino\u2019s \u2018Invisible Cities,\u2019 where such fantastical engineering schemes are the norm\u201d (50). Kolbert\u2019s invocation of Calvino as a way to understand Mowry\u2019s fantastical suggestions is apt: no such resins or policies or strategies yet exist, but the people of Miami Beach (and many other ocean-adjacent places\u2014China, Bangladesh, Indonesia) don\u2019t have the luxury of not dreaming and imagining wildly anymore. Mowry is thinking fantastically because the problems he faces are the wild, fantastical, impossible things.\nThis, I believe, is exactly the thinking we need today. Our world is going through huge, often-unknown or not-fully-understood changes, and many of our current expectations for and assumptions about how to live and how to interact with the environment need to be fundamentally changed. Maybe we don\u2019t fly anymore. Maybe we don\u2019t drive anymore. Maybe we don\u2019t eat meat anymore. Maybe we don\u2019t have jobs anymore but simply train to tend and support trees or waterways or grasslands. Probably ridiculous, but we\u2019re at a point where big, fundamental changes need to be made with modal shifts in our thinking, and this is what worldbuilding in fantasy is all about. We ask what if questions that challenge the status quo. Yes, we all know trees release oxygen, but what if they didn\u2019t? Yes, we all know animals can be for eating, but what if they weren\u2019t?\nOne of the fundamental questions asked by The Drowned World, for instance, is what if the environment were no longer perfectly suited to maintaining our place at the top of the food chain? N.K. Jemisin\u2019s Hugo-winning novel The Fifth Season asks what if we had control over and a deep connection to a tumultuous and potentially violent part of our environment (and then, of course, what if we lost that control). These kinds of questions challenge fundamental assumptions we have about how the world works, and given our rapidly changing world, I\u2019d say it\u2019s high time for them.\nIn fantasy parlance, we\u2019re circling around the term \u201cworldbuilding,\u201d which is the writer\u2019s attempt to create a system of logical consequences, rules, and structures following what Suvin Darko called a novum\u2014the novelty or innovation wrapped up in the \u201cwhat if?\u201d question of the text. And yet, \u201cworldbuilding\u201d is also an invitation for readers to be participants in the creation and understanding of the fantasy world\u2014authors can never give every effect of a novum, can never trace out each logical quirk to its end, and so part of the joy of reading a fantasy book is engaging in one\u2019s own flights of fancy (and fantasy), and in this way readers build the world, too. We exercise the muscle that allows us to both consider a fantastical novum that we don\u2019t truly understand and still find working understandings of the world based on it. And here we are, in a world where the novum is climate change\u2014a vast, shifting, sometimes-known, fickle thing that still must be acted around, that must have logical and thoughtful strategies drawn from it. Here in the Anthropocene, when rising sea levels and mass extinctions have become the norm, we worldbuild every day.\nOne of the truisms often talked about in regards to fantastical stories is that they begin with something amiss in the land and are only finished when the land is returned to status quo\u2014a mechanic that, while great for quest narratives, is less than great for anyone not thrilled with the often-monolithically normative status quo, i.e., people of color, disabled people, women, queer people. Writers of fantasy have been pushing back against stories in which we arbitrarily and automatically reassert the status quo for some time, which is hopeful for all sorts of reasons, the relevant one here, though, being the existence of stories in which part of saving the land is in ridding ourselves of dusty, problematic, and irrelevant modes of thought and action. Climate change is a threat to our land, and those working to reestablish the status quo when it comes to our relationship with the environment (and our waste practices, the kind of \u201cnature\u201d we can have nearby or purchase, etc.) have to disabuse themselves of those expectations. This new land requires a new status quo, one in which the abused and mistreated world cannot go back to being abused and mistreated. Speculative fiction has already begun exploring these kinds of narratives; the rest of the world just needs to catch up.\nWe are long past the point when serious writers and readers can be allowed to casually cast off speculative literature as work befitting outhouses, not allowed in to the mansion of Serious Literature. Perhaps it\u2019s time we left the mansion; it\u2019s not at all energy efficient and it wastes too much space.\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about The Magician\u2019s Land recently, the last book in Lev Grossman\u2019s trilogy. Those books have always been exceedingly meta, featuring a protagonist who reads fantasy novels suddenly finding himself in what could be a clich\u00e9d fantasy story, and the final book in the series is the one, perhaps, that gets closest to picking up a megaphone and yelling at the reader, \u201cYou\u2019re reading a fantasy novel about people who read fantasy novels and then try to live their lives according to them. Pay attention!\u201d Near the end, after the main character Quentin has helped to defeat the bad guys and almost save the day in the land of Fillory\u2014the magical fantasy world he used to read about as a kid (and then still as an adult)\u2014Grossman gives us this amazing scene where Quentin is granted god-like (and temporary) powers to save the crumbling, dying land of Fillory. Quentin \u201cwas no longer Fillory\u2019s reader; he had become its author.\u201d Quentin\u2019s magical skill, we find out in this book, is the mending of small objects, and he sets about mending the magical world as its once-reader and now-author, an implicit call for Grossman\u2019s readers, we who have also spent much of our lives reading and understanding the world through fantasy novels, to set about mending our own world, to go from reader to writer, to go from understanding the world to beginning to help fix it.\nThese tools I have discussed\u2014extrapolative engineering\/ethics, worldbuilding, metaphor\u2014do not, by their very inclusion in a work make it speculative fiction. I\u2019ll let cooler heads with more idle time discuss the varying and fine limits of this or that genre. The good news for Amitav Ghosh and other literary writers wringing their hands about the relegation of work to the dirty and darkened slums of genre fiction is that these tools are adaptable for any kind of work\u2014one can worldbuild in a poem or exercise extrapolation in a realist short story. I merely suggest they are stitched into the fabric of speculative literature\u2014indeed, written into its very DNA, and it\u2019s time writers, regardless of perceived genre, form, medium, or persuasion, began looking to speculative fiction for the tools and methods to contend with climate change. The future is here, and it\u2019s a magical one.\nFootnotes\n[1] Wilson\u2019s vision echoes, in spirit if not in specifics, that of Roderick Nash\u2019s book Wilderness and the American Mind. Both authors discuss the future of wilderness and both argue for a fundamental shift toward a valuation of nature that has little to nothing to do with mankind\u2019s desires. The world is not for us, they might say; we are for it.\n[2] The furor surrounding Ishiguro\u2019s novel merits note in an essay like this one. Ishiguro, a serious and much-lauded author of literary fiction, wrote The Buried Giant and freely admitted\u2014with no shame and much pride\u2014the book to be a work of fantasy, filled with dragons and ogres and a memory-prohibiting mist. Much of the discussion surrounding the book never moved past the question of its label: Is it fantasy because of its content? Literature because of its author? Serious because of its focus on characters? Silly because of dragons? As I have tried to suggest early on in this essay, these label-focused discussions often detract from the literature itself and often serve to articulate the critic in much more clarity than the book or work being critiqued. Fantasy, literature, seriousness, fun\u2014all of these are non-exclusive and, in the right hands, mutually beneficial.\n[3] Curiously, VanderMeer does nearly the same thing as Niven here: both authors take a recognizable and immediate environmental crisis and filter it through fantastical fiction. Niven, however, creates a rather clear, simplistic metaphor to understand and contend with the crisis. His is a one-for-one exchange rate. VanderMeer, though, perhaps demonstrating the way in which the fantastical novel has undergone a similar process of modernization as the literary novel that Ghosh discusses, filters not the event itself through his fantastical lens but rather the underlying ghost of the event, what VanderMeer would call the hyperobject\u2014the larger problem at work in a crisis that everyone instinctually glimpses but no one can understand fully. This is the wilderness of Annihilation: hints of logic, bits of understanding, but only in the service of a deeper, haunting unknown.\nWorks Cited\nAdmussen, Nick. \u201cSix Proposals for the Reform of Literature in the Age of Climate Change.\u201d The Critical Flame: A Journal of Literature and Culture. 9 May 2016.\nAlexander, Lloyd.

Let me show you pinpricks of light that break through dark to shimmer and dance on ice and water. Let me fill your head with songs that hum low and shudder deep in oceans, songs of wonder, of peace, of beauty. For night is a time to rest still and let the world grow closer to you.\nRest, child.\nRest tucked tightly into furs. Be warm on a cold night. Let in the light in dark times. As the room dims and your mind brightens, let the last thought you conjure be one of hope. You dip into slumber and pass into my domain, making your way through half-remembered memories, theories of strangeness and notions of wonder.\nCome to me.\nCome and watch ribbons of colour snake their way through the indigo sky. The shimmering greens and blues descend through the clouds, swirling and dancing to their own secret melodies. Don\u2019t think they\u2019ve forgotten about you. Jump, and jump again. Higher, this time. Become entangled within the Northern Lights as they embrace you, and hold you, and bring them with you.\nFly, child.\nSoar with auroras and moonbeams, let the colours and shapes pull you through the Arctic air. Chase frost and dodge the biting winter winds. Laugh, and be filled with the wonder of the night. I made this dream for you. You fly upwards, hunting the moon, desiring a piece of that gleaming white pearl. It would make a great gift for your mother. You close in on the moon, the colours in the air supporting you always, and bring hands around it. It will to be difficult to carry, but you think you can lift it. Just as you\u2019re about to grab hold, the moon goes dark.\nEverything goes dark.\nWhy has it all gone dark? You can\u2019t see anything. You panic. You\u2019re afraid. This isn\u2019t right. There\u2019s a desperate howl in the darkness, a wailing shriek in the distance. I didn\u2019t plan this. You shudder. Without the colours of the night keeping you afloat, you fall.\nYou scream.\nDon\u2019t scream. Who wants to give you bad dreams, dear child? Not if I can help it. As you fall, little yellow lights pop up in the darkness. Fuzzy at first, they dance in your vision and land on your nose, making you sneeze. You laugh. Now you aren\u2019t falling anymore. You float lazily in inky currents as the fireflies dance, landing softly on plains of tall grass. I can\u2019t find the moon, or the stars, but surely the lightning bugs can guide you. You chase one in particular, that you name Lusa. They look just like in your picture books, don\u2019t they? But one by one, the little lanterns disappear. Lusa dims and blinks out of existence and you blink too. The tall grass wraps around you, twisting your arms, restraining your legs, trapping you in your place. You scream, and I know that tears will follow soon.\nNo, I will not let that happen.\nThat won\u2019t happen. I try sending you away from the grass, to the forests in your favourite fairy tales. Forests of woodland animals to chase and rocks to climb and streams to cross. But the woods corrupt too, darkening, losing their leaves, the rocks sharpening and falling, the animals baring their teeth and chasing you back. I try sending you out into the ocean, to sail the seven seas, but a hurricane capsizes your boat. I try the city you visited this summer, with the neon lights and never-ending skyscrapers. But they are poisoned too, and the towers creep forwards, whispering that they\u2019ll crush you between them.\nYou\u2019re crying now.\nChildren should not cry in their dreams. This is my time to show you excitement and intrigue and all the beauty you can comprehend. But I can\u2019t. You run. But not to chase down the goodness in the world. You run to escape evil, you run out of fear.\nFear of what?\nIn between your sobs, the whispers continue. I listen. The voices, wicked and menacing, seep into your subconscious. You trip. You fall. So much falling. There\u2019s blood on the pavement and it\u2019s yours. I want to see you fly again, up away from the towers that threaten to trap you, and the lights that drip poisonous green and the rats in the storm drain clawing their way out. But my powers are gone. The voices whisper in ill intent.\nThe voices get louder.\nWe can hear the words now. You clutch your head and bring your nose to your knees, but you can\u2019t escape them. They speak of long days and loneliness. The dream changes, and it is not my doing. The city is sick, sicker than any of the previous scenes. A single penny under your palm stretches and slides, growing around you, encasing you. A copper cage with wheels.\nYou\u2019re in a car.\nThe car is too small. You bang on the windows, but there\u2019s no escape. It\u2019s too hot and it burns your hands. The towers of the city curve towards you, creeping too close for comfort, creating a cage inside a cage. The car starts, and you\u2019re whisked down a sickly street, past faceless souls in the night. The voices speak of days in cages, of wasting away, of screaming in silence. They grow louder, more confident, with each passing moment. I listen closely, unable to do anything else. A few moments, and I know who is doing this. I know who is giving you bad dreams.\nAnd I will stop him.\nYou\u2019ve had bad dreams before, child. Nightmares of unnamed monsters and unknown evils. But this is a new kind of nightmare, a nightmare named and known. And I can help, just wait. You won\u2019t be crying for much longer. But first, you have to open yourself up to the fear, you have to let it sink in. The car hurtles towards one of the grey city towers, and you scream. There\u2019s no escape, dear child. You must let the dream take you inside.\nThe car crashes into the building.\nRubble explodes into the street and the windshield cracks. The noise is deafening. You cover your ears but it doesn\u2019t help. We whisk through the building, white and sterile, no colour, no plants, no life. You\u2019re crying, but I\u2019m listening. The voices speak of empty rooms and lost memories, of never going back, of never knowing joy, of concrete and isolation. I listen. From the fears, I spin memories. From these memories, I find what you\u2019re afraid of.\nYou\u2019re afraid of moving.\nThe city you thought was so vibrant and full of life is the place your old life will come to die. The copper car dissolves around you, and the apartment sneaks in. Four walls form a new cage. The whiteness is blinding, overwhelming, bleaching. It stains your left foot, sapping the colour and leaving a dried husk in its place. You jump up and down, but there\u2019s no escape. Then your right foot is drained of colour, and the bleach works its way up to your knees. You scream.\nYou cry.\nFrom the memories, I conjure him. As the room shrinks and you lose yourself, he appears. He is cloaked in white, hidden from you, but his darkness makes me uneasy.\nTo eliminate Fear, we must face him head on.\nHis curses echo off the soulless white walls, ringing in a chorus against you. But it\u2019s okay. You wouldn\u2019t believe me, but it\u2019s okay. The bleaching white works its way up to your neck. You look down, and your body is a shriveled white husk. You\u2019d scream if there was any air left in your dried-up lungs. From under his white cloak, Fear smiles, and I have to restrain myself. Be happy, Fear.\nIt won\u2019t last long.\nWhen you\u2019re fully encapsulated, nothing but a wrinkled white statue, I act. For every nasty thought that Fear puts in your head, I find a nicer thought. A thought of hope. This I can do. We can\u2019t escape him, but we can fight him off. So help me, dear child, help me to fill this nightmare with colour and life. Fear says you\u2019ll be trapped inside, I say no. Let\u2019s add some windows: big ones, wide ones. Let\u2019s let in the bright city lights and neon colours. And you\u2019ll never forget your old life. Let\u2019s paint this room lavender and mint against indigo sky. You add your furs and your stuffed animals, and I make the toy polar bear do a little dance around Fear. Fear recoils.\nI can win this.\nOutside, a city street hunches up and wiggles, like a worm, until it pokes through our new windows. You won\u2019t be trapped. You won\u2019t be alone. Those faceless souls outside will soon have faces, smiling faces. And there will be new joys here.\nLet\u2019s take a road trip.\nI call the copper car that you so hated and it\u2019s no longer too small or too hot. You get in, and I close the door before Fear join you. He slams against the windows, hissing, but you\u2019re not paying attention. Instead, I give you a map, and you pick out all the places you\u2019ll go. We drive the car outside, though the big wide windows, and whisk past new food and music and parks and shops in a whirlwind of city lights and neon colours\u2026\nYou yawn.\nIt\u2019s almost time for me to let you go, dear child. And so, as the world brightens and your imagination dims, let the last thought you have be a good one.\nLet it be of Hope.\nAnika Morshed had many nightmares as a small child (and as a small adult). She\u2019d like to believe they were good for character. If not that, perhaps they were good for a ghost story or two, or those campy horror movies where aliens suck your brain out with a straw. That is perhaps more her style. In other news, she\u2019s currently studying at the University of Waterloo, surviving on a diet of stale rice and classic science fiction.\n\u201cBad Dreams\u201d (\u00a9 Anika Morshed) was published in Issue 7 of Capricious.

This late, with only bar goers and line cooks like her loose on the street, Rikka takes notice of any little change. She squares her shoulders, clenches her knives a little tighter to her side.\nSomething coming, she thinks and it\u2019s nonsense, it\u2019s foolishness, but Rikka trusts her gut.\nShe steps warily, keys jutting between her knuckles, one hand ready on her bag. Big as she is\u2014roller derby mean, kitchen heavy\u2014Rikka doesn\u2019t have to worry like her slender sister, but she knows not worth the trouble don\u2019t mean trouble won\u2019t come. Same as the rink, better to face it with momentum.\nCrossing the last intersection towards home, the streets here smaller and deserted, Rikka half jogs along the wall of an empty warehouse, her free palm flat against her knives to stop the bag bouncing. The oddness in the air grows thicker. The traffic on distant Fifth Ave falls flat and strangely muffled. The streetlights crackle. Rikka hears laughter, close but tinny, like voices on an old radio. She smells pine wood burning, smells the char on a slab of fat, smells marrow sizzling in a hot pan\u2014\nAgain, the streetlights pop. This time, every last one flickers out.\nBlinking in the sudden dark, Rikka stumbles to a stop. She gropes for the wall beside her and finds nothing. Even when she crabwalks a few careful steps over, her hand falls on empty air.\nSomething coming, Rikka thinks, and the thought don\u2019t seem so crazy now.\nAbove her, the sky rolls. Her skin tingles, hairs dancing on the back of her neck. She can\u2019t hear any sounds from the city, now; no cars, no beeping crosswalks, no living people. She hears\u2026 whispering, so close she expects to feel breathing in her ear, but still tinny in that ancient radio way, sounding so strange, so familiar\u2026\nSlowly, her eyes adjust. Rikka finds herself standing in the mouth of an alley that never existed. Where once her daily commute took her past a solid wall of warehouse, today, the walls of the warehouse bend away from her. Heavy brickwork melts into stone slabs, the space shifting in the darkness, outline distinct and misshapen in a way that pinches at her vision. Despite the lack of streetlights and a cloud-gotten moon, a kind of glow settles on the alley, diffuse light seeping from the stones, from too-green lichen and a tenacious blanket of weeds.\nHeartbeat thudding in her teeth, Rikka stares at the over-saturated greenery, the strange silence and feels familiar. She remembers her grandmother\u2014she remembers humid summer evenings spent standing at the kitchen window, her knuckles grey against the metal lip of the sink, waiting for something she wouldn\u2019t explain.\n\u201cElf light,\u201d she\u2019d call it, her voice taut with love and grief in a way that scared her. \u201cA trick of the storm.\u201d\nRikka didn\u2019t understand. Doesn\u2019t understand this now, either, but her eyes fall on a book in the alley, water-stained and forgotten on the pavement and she doesn\u2019t understand, but she knows\u2014somehow, she knows this place in her bones.\nThe whispering radio voices falter and fall silent. The air smells sweet\u2014molasses, muscovado, marzipan\u2014smells of bonfires and burning. Smells familiar, and Rikka swallows, tasting memory, tasting possibility\u2026\nHer stomach cramps. She finds herself starving, suddenly, so violently hungry her whole body hurts with it. And that\u2014\nRikka\u2019s heard this story. Now, she understands.\nShe doesn\u2019t know what her grandmother got herself into\u2014doesn\u2019t know who and it\u2019s too late to ask\u2014but now they\u2019ve got her, big and mean, a kitchen worth of knives.\nSomething coming, Rikka thinks. That something\u2019s me.\nBaring her teeth, she strides into the alley, hearing the radio voices hissing at each other, hearing some kind of claws scritch-scrabbling away in the darkness.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she says and snatches up the book from the green-damp stone. \u201cI\u2019ll bite.\u201d\nHunched over her kitchen table, shoulders tight and wary, Rikka palms the symbols tooled into the leather cover. She expects something\u2014distant voices, sudden dark\u2014but nothing happens. Outside of its lunatic alley, it\u2019s just a book; leather and yellowed paper and illegible crows\u2019 feet parading down the page.\nSlowly, Rikka breathes. She stretches her arms, loosening the night-long knot in her shoulders and eases into a chair.\nShe can\u2019t read it, but she doesn\u2019t have to. She knows this book by its smell, by grease darkening the cover, jam-stained fingerprints in the margin and flour on the spine. She learned to read from books like this, learned her craft when her elbows barely reached the counter, divining secrets from every neighborhood grandmother willing to part with heirloom biscuits and family spice rubs. She recognizes ingredients in the haphazard paths, spies measurements in the precise passage of birds.\nThey\u2019re recipes. Recipes and magic.\nEverything she wanted as a girl\u2014\nEverything she still wants, well-worn daydreams hidden in a hundred soups and sauces.\n\u201cFigures I can\u2019t read it,\u201d she mutters, but, tying back her braids, she tries anyway.\nRikka empties her fridge struggling to decode some kind of sense from the book in front of her. She eats and reads; old take-out scouring the internet for runes, a box of cookies researching ancient Minoan script. She eats and reads; a brick of cheese attempting ciphers and the last of her graham crackers on the Voynich manuscript\u2019s Wikipedia page. Bent over the water-stained paper, dawn-light dripping through her kitchen window, Rikka eats and she reads\u2014\nBut everything tastes of ash and none of the words make sense\u2014\nAnd still her stomach cramps, empty and desperate.\nMore magic, she figures, another trick of the brewing storm. Scrubbing at her eyes, Rikka sighs, abandoning the book for bed. She\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow, she tells herself, her grandmother\u2019s summer stare heavy in her mind. She\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\nShe works in a kitchen; ain\u2019t like they can starve her.\nRikka stands at one end of a banquet table, an unfamiliar book in her arms, leather warm against her skin where the silk of her dress dips low. Her stomach rolls, so hungry her head spins with it. Mouth cottony and stomach aching, her eyes rove, already searching the table for her first taste.\nShe sees spiced red wine pooling in a bowl of roasted pears. Liquid chocolate kisses merlot, flecked with gold. A mason jar sits at her right hand, aged sour cherries steeped in Armagnac, smelling of late summer and her grandmother\u2019s kitchen. Her grandmother\u2026\n\u201cTook her long enough to come back,\u201d someone whispers. She can\u2019t tell who, above the music and laughter, can\u2019t tear her eyes from the food.\nAnother replies, \u201cNo, this is a different one.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like the last one.\u201d\n\u201cLast one didn\u2019t work,\u201d someone new murmurs.\n\u201cLast one almost worked,\u201d someone else corrects.\nRikka swallows. She should sit. Her throat hurts. Her stomach hurts. The book sinks in her arms, prodding sharp into the padding of her ribs. She switches it to her other hand. The woman nearest to her shrinks away.\nShe came here for something, Rikka thinks, struggling to concentrate. The book\u2014she came here\u2014\nNearby, roasted garlic soup steams in its heavy carafe, thick with cream and bellied up beside a loaf of crusty bread. Mussels roll and dance between the trays, buttered medallions shedding a trail of fleur de sel. A salad of wild mushrooms blooms from the table itself, chives and chanterelles and dark truffle pearls jutting from cracks in the wax-varnished wood.\nSomeone laughs, spinning away from the table and back into the throng of dancers. In the flickering gas lights, Rikka comes away with the sense of a wide hall, mahogany paneling and brass fittings on the walls. People fill the space, swaying with street-fight elegance, gaunt suits and beaded gowns, bare feet hissing time to the odd, warbling music. Not quite jazz, not quite lullaby, Rikka can almost pick out the words. It sounds like a song she remembers. Knows it well enough to hum along\u2014\nHer stomach hurts. Her hands shake. She boosts the book onto her hip, trying to shift the ungainly weight. Two dancers nearest to her flinch. Rikka frowns. She wants to ask if there\u2019s somewhere she can put it down, but she can see there\u2019s no room\u2014\nShe can see a cut crystal bowl of pomegranates, tiny carnelians swimming through sloe gin\u2014\nAnd Rikka\u2019s hungry, but standing at the end of the table, her eyes clear. She read mythology as a kid. Read a little more in her aborted attempt at college. Enough to know the shape of this, anyway\u2014to recognize the dozen stories grown from these seeds. Persephone lured with the promise of a flower, the Goblin Market, the Erlk\u00f6nig.\nDon\u2019t eat, the story goes. Not meat, not a seed, not a bite of peach.\nRikka swallows, tasting the memory of smoke and bone in the hollow of her throat and she\u2019s hungry\u2014god, she\u2019s hungry\u2014but she\u2019s herself again.\n\u201cIs it not to your liking?\u201d someone at her side asks.\n\u201cToo mundane, perhaps,\u201d another murmurs.\nImmediately, two broad figures approach the table, carrying a huge salt slab between them easy as bussing tables. A lion reclines on the tray, slow roasted whole and burnished bronze, smelling of dry earth, of garlic and cayenne and thyme.\nRikka\u2019s stomach cramps. She steels her jaw, tongue stuck to the dry roof of her mouth, and she wants to laugh, she wants to eat\u2014\nShe wants magic; she wants recipes.\nBeside her, one of the fae leans close, careful to avoid the jutting corner of her book.\n\u201cYou see?\u201d she whispers with a face for sharing secrets, black eyes searching, oddly intent. \u201cHunt what hunts you.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t,\u201d someone says across the table, half laughing. \u201cThey never do.\u201d\nPressed against the polished table, Rikka\u2019s free hand starts to itch. Her skin crawls. The back of her neck burns.\nShe knows the way the story\u2019s supposed to go. Surrounded by dancers, fae creatures hunting, she knows what she\u2019s supposed to do. Look pretty, eat nothing, say nothing, follow the rules. Just like all her years at school, burning up waiting for the clock to move.\nAnd everything\u2019s so artfully fabricated, flawless and pristine, so goddamn perfect\u2014\nHiking up her fairy-given skirt, Rikka vaults onto the table. Wine splashes the floor. Buttered scallops roll away, something warm and soupy splattering beneath her heel. In a wave, the diners recoil, dodging spilled sauces and scattered meats. Chairs fall backwards. Voices shout. Even the music clatters to a halt.\nRikka ignores it all. It\u2019s not hard. Every weekend at the rink, she weathers a tougher crowd than this. Heedless of all the yelling, she strides forward, kicking treats out of her path. And up high, above the haze of cookery and magic, she finally sees the far end.\nA woman sits at the head of the table, purple-lipped and laughing. She wears a soft white suit, so stark against blue-black skin. A crown of mistletoe sits atop her wild briar curls. A necklace of human teeth grazes the glittering hollow of her collar bone. In the uncertain gas lights, her eyes shine, a predatory glimmer from two flat coins.\nRikka stares right back. She knows her stories\u2014she knows her monsters, her legends, her myths. Faced with this one, Rikka grins.\nHunt what hunts you.\nStanding barefoot in fris\u00e9e and chanterelles, she lifts the book above her head.\nThe crowd seethes; the Erlk\u00f6nig rises from her throne\u2014\nAnd Rikka lets it fall.\nShe wakes unbreathing, her alarm ringing and her bedsheets flaked in ocean salt.\nLaying there in that tiny wreckage, Rikka can\u2019t help laughing. She takes a pinch from her pillow and places it beneath her tongue.\nHunt what hunts you? The girls at the rink call her Wrecka Ball.\nShe wonders if all the fae and goblins knew what they were asking for.\nThe second time, Rikka knows what to expect. Enough to prepare little. She goes to bed with the cookbook in a messenger bag and wakes to find it waiting at her hip. Same as before, a banquet table sprawls in front of her. Unlike yesterday, though, this one looks like it\u2019s been through a war, battered up and varnish gone, piled high but diners missing.\nSlowly, Rikka walks the length of the weathered trencher, trailing fingers over dishes she knows better than to eat. Tiny sparrows fried whole, salted and dripping with grease. Black sausage on a bed of apples. Skate in caper butter, tarragon and watercress. She moves a bowl of gnocchi swimming in marrow fat and bree, unearths a rainbow of tiny macaroons sitting underneath.\nShe counts seven geese, articulated upright in a pond of peaches and cardamom. Two lambs sit nose to nose in pomegranate sauce, studded with rosemary. A giant boar stands as the centerpiece\u2014head lifted, fig-roasted and fragrant\u2014and well, at least they\u2019re trying harder today. Credit where it\u2019s due.\nRikka turns away.\nShe finds herself in a wide clearing ringed with trees, taller and darker than anything she\u2019s ever seen. Fist-sized lights glitter in the boughs. Several massive bonfires dominate the clearing. Everywhere she looks, Rikka sees fae. No longer playing at humanity, feral and laughing, they dance in little beyond their skin.\nRikka steps a little closer, drawn by the drums, the heat of their disjointed singing. No, not just skin, she realizes. They all wear matching armor, but only a single piece each. She spots a gauntlet on one, a pauldron on another. Char-black chitin catches the light, tarnished silver chains knotted in intricate patterns and left to hang. The fringe hisses against naked flanks, whispering into the song.\nRikka remembers the Erlk\u00f6nig\u2019s necklace of teeth. She wonders\u2014\nBut no, it don\u2019t matter. She grips the strap of her bag, cookbook heavy against her side. They\u2019re vicious creatures\u2014some bigger than bears, vast hips twisting in the beat\u2014but she\u2019s big, too. She\u2019s got her grandmama\u2019s stride; she\u2019s got her grandmama\u2019s name.\nKitchen big, she reminds herself. Roller-derby mean. Hunt what hunts you, Rikka thinks, and she intends to\u2014intends to dance, if not to eat\u2014but the moment she steps into the firelight, the dancers cease.\nAcross the clearing, she sees the Erlk\u00f6nig.\nTonight she wears a gown of feathers and living moths. Her hair coils around her head, braided through her crown of mistletoe. A kind of quiet question in her eyes, she smiles, but doesn\u2019t move.\nThat\u2019s fine, Rikka figures. She can be brave enough for two.\nOffering up a smile of her own, she walks across the grass. The dancers shift back. The Erlk\u00f6nig remains. She watches Rikka approach, face wide and open. Hope, she\u2019d call it on a human, but Rikka\u2019s not sure now. Nobody\u2019s ever looked at her like that\u2014like she might have the answer to everything\u2014and her heart flutters in her throat, not quite scared but something close.\nStopping before the Erlk\u00f6nig, Rikka swallows, smiling, keenly aware of the law of goblin fruit, aware of Persephone conquering a kingdom with a mouthful of seeds. Her pulse pounds loud in her ears\u2014now or never, now or never\u2014and Rikka makes her choice.\n\u201cI want to learn this,\u201d she says. \u201cCan you teach me? Recipes, spells\u2014it don\u2019t matter to me. I want everything.\u201d\nThe assembled hold their breath. Everyone seems to hold so still around her, frozen and waiting. Rikka senses the tide of the story changing, the rules she knows bending in a new direction, but she does not turn to look around her. She looks only at the Erlk\u00f6nig\u2014her eyes gold coins in the almost-dark\u2014and carefully does not look away.\nUnblinking, the Erlk\u00f6nig stares back. She holds her body rigid, bent to run and bent to fight, her inhuman face so tight with want it seizes at Rikka\u2019s lungs. Slowly, her hands move, strong fingers painting unseen patterns in the air between them. A spell, Rikka thinks, until nothing happens. Belatedly, she realizes she\u2019s signing.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to teach me that, too,\u201d she tells her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to hear you.\u201d\nThe assembled breathe. They move. Translating for the Erlk\u00f6nig, she thinks, listening to chains whisper against burnt-bone armor. But Rikka doesn\u2019t turn to look. Her eyes fix on the Erlk\u00f6nig, the woman smiling now, wide enough to show her pointed teeth. Her head dips, almost shy. But she watches Rikka, careful and gauging as she shifts a little closer. Moving slow, as if not to startle, the Erlk\u00f6nig reaches into the empty air.\nThe fires sigh. Mist curls in the chill breeze and coils around her fingers, a chalice filling up her palm. Gingerly, so gentle, she reaches for Rikka\u2019s hand and cups it to the goblet between her own.\nRikka\u2019s heart shivers in her throat. She swallows it back down, concentrates instead on the unexpected warmth of the Erlk\u00f6nig\u2019s skin, callused and crosshatched with a strange pattern of scars, blue-dark against gold, gold\u2014glass goblet, mead and her own brown skin\u2014a kingdom\u2019s worth of gold.\nRikka wonders if a kingdom\u2019s what she\u2019s being offered here.\nShe steps close. Close enough to feel moths and feathers ghosting against her skin, luminous in the firelight. Close enough for warm breath to kiss her cheek, the sharp green scent of mistletoe curling in her nose. Close enough for the Erlk\u00f6nig to lift the goblet between them and press it to her waiting lips.\nRikka smells honey, caramel salted and sweet. Her stomach clenches, wanting, ready, starving\u2014\nBut the cup rests empty against her mouth.\nHumorless and bitter, the Erlk\u00f6nig bares her teeth. Her hands flash. She steps away, cold air rushing into the space she leaves.\n\u201cYou see?\u201d the assembled whisper, translating so Rikka can hear. \u201cDo you understand now?\u201d\nRikka shakes her head. Her chest hurts. Her stomach gnaws. She sets her jaw, stepping forward as the Erlk\u00f6nig steps back.\n\u201cI can help you,\u201d she says. Her left hand clenches around the empty cup. The other seizes the Erlk\u00f6nig\u2019s sleeve.\nAbruptly, the woman-creature stops. Rikka can feel the muscles beneath her hand draw taut, though to run or fight she can\u2019t be sure. Around them, the assembled fall still, every eye fixed to the two of them.\nWind whistles through the trees, chasing ribbons of cloud across the moon. Crows cough in the trees. Coyotes howl. The Erlk\u00f6nig moves. Somewhere in the cacophony, Rikka hears, \u201cHow?\u201d\nLosing feeling in her fingers, she squeezes the chalice tighter. Her other hand jumps and spasms, lost in fistful of silk and feathers and escaping moths. Still, Rikka holds on and holds her ground. Trust me, she thinks, you gotta trust me, searching out the Erlk\u00f6nig\u2019s eyes.\nShe says, \u201cWell, for one thing, I can feed you,\u201d stepping forward\u2014\nAnd wakes on her floor to the sound of shattering, violet petals strewn in glass-shard patterns across her tangled sheets and the strange new scars of her palms.\nSlowly, sitting in the pastel wreckage, Rikka relearns how to breathe. She cradles her still-sore hand in her lap, mapping the runes, and she knows a little now from that long night trawling Wikipedia, but she\u2019s not sure what runes these were meant to be. She\u2019s dropped her palm on too many oven doors and hot pans\u2014once lost her grip on a fish knife and needed stitches\u2014so the wiry ropes read of nothing but a new carelessness.\nShe wonders if it was meant to be a curse. She thinks of the Erlk\u00f6nig, her scars worn smooth with time and calluses, the woman grim and hurting and barely daring to hope. She thinks of her grandmother, her own hand scored in grill-pan lines.\nThinks of her grandmother, standing at the kitchen window, watching every summer storm.\nYeah, she thinks and rises. Damn right she understands.\nStill wearing her pajamas, Rikka goes to war. Balanced on a kitchen chair, she pries the batteries from her smoke alarm. She cracks a window, chooses from the knives her mother gave her, and opens the front cover of the unfamiliar book.\nSlicing down the binding, Rikka shucks out the meat of the pages. She leaves the tooled leather shell behind her on the table, clicks on the stove\u2019s front burner.\nSmoke billows into the kitchen the moment paper touches flame, smelling of wood smoke and marrow bones, of roasted pears and aged sour cherries, of peaches and pomegranates and fig-roasted boar, of wild laughter and leaf mold and wet grass.\nHer palm burns, but Rikka\u2019s not new to the kitchen. She keeps a bottle of aloe vera on the shelf beside her stove.\nDetermined, eyes and throat and palm stinging in the smoke, she takes her grandmother\u2019s cookbook from where it lives on her tiny back counter. Not grand like the pile of parchment she drops smoldering in her sink, her grandmother built this cookbook from an ungainly packet of mismatched paper, all different colors and all different sizes, a lifetime of recipes scrawled down upon waking, during phone calls and errands and TV shows.\n\u201cSomething I ate in a dream,\u201d she used to say and Rikka understands. She understands.\nSo she slides her grandmother\u2019s cookbook into the empty cover\u2014packs recipes for pot roasts and fudge between the rune-marked bindings\u2014and, standing at her kitchen table, Rikka candies violets.\nThe recipe is in the book. Egg wash and fine sugar. A little lemon zest, a little salt. There\u2019s a kind of magic to it, she thinks, as she slides the tray into the oven. A spark of life living in the memory of summer, of lavender-scented birthday cakes for a ten-year-old girl just learning how to pipe roses, of a sun-burnt face full of oven steam, of berry-picking and a thousand questions about jam.\nOr maybe it\u2019s just a promise.\nEither way.\nWhen they cool, Rikka packs the crisp petals in plastic and presses the bag between the pages of her grandmother\u2019s book. She turns on the dishwasher, gives her kitchen one last look-over. The stove reads 9:15. She\u2019s not needed at work until two.\nRikka shuts the window. Holding the book under one arm, she goes back to bed.\nBroken glass crunches underfoot. A savanna wreckage of bone picked carcasses jut from the grass. The table slumps, weather worn and rain shattered, rotted through the center. The clearing sits empty, lit only by a pregnant moon. All around her, Rikka hears coyotes laughing, wolves howling to kin. Kicking tarnished silver platters, she turns her back on the blackened remnants of old bonfires and walks into the trees.\nIf this is the Wild Hunt, Rikka is not afraid. Eyes glow in the darkness around her, lighting her way. She meets the forest like she meets the rink and, kitchen big, roller-derby mean, Rikka plows her way through like she knows it. Foxes bound at her side, leaping over fallen limbs, chattering, eager. An enormous boar crashes through the underbrush, followed by a second and a third. She catches an elk from the corner of her eye, antlers threaded gold. And as they run, they change, flowing into fae, into something close to human\u2014wild women leaping barefoot through the undergrowth and bracken. They laugh, they sing, howling hope and triumph, urging her on, urging her faster\u2014\nRikka breaks from the trees and into a mossy grove. She stops. The dancers circle around her.\nThe Erlk\u00f6nig stands in the center of the clearing, her crown of braids unravelling. This time, she is fully armored, wearing all the pieces she scattered amongst her dancers, barely visible in the breathing dark but for the way her eyes shine.\nHolding the book to her chest, without hesitation, Rikka strides to meet her.\n\u201cTeach me your recipes,\u201d she says, feeling her heartbeat pounding in her teeth. \u201cTeach me magic. Teach me to hear you.\u201d\nThe Erlk\u00f6nig inclines her head. She steps forward, hands moving, her face raw with hope.\nBreath held, barely a whisper, the assembled murmur, \u201cAnd what do you offer me?\u201d\nRikka grins. She shifts her hold on the book, lets the cover fall open.\nAnd in the light of a watery sunrise, she opens a plastic bag.\nCrystal Lynn Hilbert lives in the forgotten backwaters of Western Pennsylvania and subsists mostly on old trade paperbacks and tea.

Every day the pain gets worse, his energy is waning, and things are becoming harder to keep concealed. Still, he gets up, makes his coffee and toast, treks to the bus stop, to work, to the bus stop, then home.\nSo far, blessedly, the charade has held. Despite his secret tentacles \u2013 ever-churning just beneath the surface of his skin \u2013 he manages to soothe and quiet his thoughts, dampening them to whispers; keeping up his pleasant, ordinary appearance, maintaining his careful, deliberate words. Though it is exhausting, he has managed to remain anonymous \u2013 forgettable \u2013 to slip through life with a calculated mediocrity.\nWhen he gets off of the bus in front of the factory this morning, he is tired. His back and head ache. He can feel his tentacles are swollen, swirling and swaying within. He is terrified that today will be the day that they finally break free and flop out for all to see.\nHe can\u2019t go home though, can\u2019t risk asking for yet another sick day. This point is driven further as he passes through the cafeteria on his way to the locker rooms. Men, younger, fitter, and willing to work harder for less, sit and laugh over coffee before their shift. The tentacles within Peter throb painfully, and as he pauses; his eyes water, hanging on their beauty \u2013 their stubbled jaws and broad shoulders \u2013 until the men take notice, and leer his way. Peter tugs down his cap, the tentacles once more quiet to bearable stirrings, and he hurries off to change into his uniform and set to work.\nThe first task of the day is a major one: a carriage on one of the knitting machines needs calibrating, the broken machine is holding up production. The solution should come easily; he\u2019s done such a task a hundred times before, but today his worn mind is reaching for focus. He\u2019s been working at it for some time when the boss comes. She is angry. Shouting. The tentacles begin pushing so hard against the backs of Peter\u2019s eyes that his vision blurs with every beat of his heart.\nThe boss\u2019s eyes stretch, and spittle flies with her words, but he is no longer listening. Instead, he is feeling the weight of the metal ratchet in his hand. He imagines how her face will twist in shock and agony as the ratchet crunches into the top of her head; the sound of bone cracking; the spray of hot blood.\nHis hand twitches but he doesn\u2019t raise his arm. Her face twists, not with agony, but with disgust and surprise, and he realizes something of his innards must be working their way out; he quickly wipes at his nose to hide the dangling tentacle tip, allowing it to suck back up inside. Her face relaxes, and though she\u2019s still angry, and now looks a little troubled, she stops talking at him and turns and walks away.\nPeter gets back to work, thankful it was no more than a brief slip.\nIt is the only slip that day, despite his aching exhaustion. He works late, just as he arrives early, to avoid the crushes of men in the locker room. He can never allow himself to think of those busy locker rooms, except maybe late in the night, in the dark. Then, the tentacles can flow freely, holding and caressing one another, finding release; but only at such an ungodly hour that, on the morrow, he can pretend it was nothing more than a strange and terrible dream.\nHe waits alone at the bus stop. The bus is late, and he is so tired; the realisation comes at him in a cold rush \u2013 what will happen if he doesn\u2019t get home soon. Exhaustion is about to break him open; his tentacles are about to burst free. He gives up on waiting and begins to walk, hoping the effort will force his fleshy casing to maintain its hold until he gets home.\nHe hits Wellington. It is a street he\u2019s journeyed many times within the steel cocoon of the bus, but never set sole to cement on. The scents and noise spill from venues and patios, wash over him \u2013 the clatter of voices, cups, and cutlery; wafting scents of yeasty beer; the sweat and clamour of boisterous men, men with glittering eyes and deep, throaty laughs.\nThe tentacles push, pounding heavy tattoos against his taut skin. Home is still many blocks away. It\u2019s too far. He knows that he isn\u2019t going to make it, that it is all going to spill out. He knows that he is powerless to stop it. The only decision he has left is where it might end, and that is an easy choice. The revelation that he is going to die comes with a rush of fear but also a sweet backwash of relief \u2013 the pain will finally stop.\nHe turns off Wellington, toward the water. It is easy. Automatic. He can smell the river \u2013 he\u2019s always been able to smell it, no matter where he goes. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s seen it, though long has he imagined slipping into its cool embrace \u2013 he never dared; water makes it impossible to keep hidden the moist, dark skin that seethes within, and so he\u2019s always avoided the siren call of the river\u2019s heady scent. But soon all would be revealed anyway, and better to be taken by the river than to be bashed to death \u2013 a monster \u2013 a spectacle \u2013 pulped to a gooey mash in the street.\nHe is ready \u2013 or so he thinks, but as the river comes into view he is suddenly pricked by doubt. He spots a riverside caf\u00e9 and makes a plea to the frenzied masses inside him for one last, sweet moment of life, promising them he\u2019ll go in soon.\nHe is shaking by the time he orders an iced tea. The man behind the counter smiles and takes his change. It is hard to breathe. The tentacles thrash, demanding freedom. His vision flashes red and black, red and black, popping with white starbursts. As his head grows light, Peter gives up on getting to the river and hopes that he will at least be able to stumble outside, to die in the fresh, open air.\n\u201cSir? Can you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d The flashing of his vision ebbs, but the world is still a haze before his eyes.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d The barista\u2019s eyebrows raise.\n\u201cThis wash a bash idea.\u201d Peter words are slurred by a tongue turned fat and squirming, sloshing in his mouth.\nThen it happens; one gets loose, whipping out from between his lips and suctioning onto his nose. Peter falls forward, clutching the counter, and hears a collective gasp from behind. The iced tea spills; it is so cold, soaking his front. The tentacles heave and he hears his skin begin to tear. His skull groans against the pressure.\n\u201cSir?\u201d\nHe tries to answer, but his mouth is full as the tentacles thrust out. His knees give and he crumples. Then people are catching him, easing him to the floor. A half-dozen faces hover above; the group of men who\u2019d been in line behind him. Some are gaping, others pull out their cellphones. Everything moves too much, their faces, their eyes, their bodies, leaving little lag lines in his vision.\nIt is not easy to close his eyes, they are so swollen and bulging, but he does it because he doesn\u2019t want to see who will wield the bat, or the knife, or whatever it is that they use to destroy his eight slimy, fleshy appendages that now protrude from his tattered skin.\nHe is waiting. But nothing happens. No one screams or lashes out. When he manages to peak from one, bulging eye, he sees faces marked with concern \u2013 but only that \u2013 not horror, not disgust, not even surprise.\n\u201cHello? 9-1-1? Hello?\u201d one of the men speaks into his phone, then his face twists in anger, and then he says to the others, \u201cThey put me on hold!\u201d\nPeter reaches out a single tentacle, its suction cups stick onto the caller\u2019s arm. \u201cPlessss,\u201d he begs, shaking his bulbous head, fearful of what the medical world might do to him. The world rolls as he is turned by the final shedding of his human flesh; his tubular, grey mantle is now fully out, for all the world to see.\nThe man holding the phone looks down. Peter stares back from one of his large, round eyes, confused because he is still seeing only concern \u2013 nothing more. He speaks through lips that are pinching and hardening into a sharp beak. \u201cJush lesh me dieeee.\u201d The world is so dry, all the moisture has been sucked away, the air is like sandpaper, and it scratches his slick skin and scalds his lungs with every laboured breath.\n\u201cWe have to get him into the water!\u201d the barista shouts. With great care, several people lift Peter and carry him outside. \u201cThrow him in,\u201d the barista says. \u201cI will follow.\u201d\nThere is a moment of weightlessness, and then Peter is falling.\nHe hits the river with a splash, and he thinks, this is death, and it is good, because he feels no more pain. He is sure that he is dead because he has forgotten that in the absence of pain, there can still be life. He is drifting, now, carried off by the current.\nThere is a distant splash, and then a voice, muted, but calling, \u201cHey, mister, hey!\u201d Then another being, a white and beautiful, many-armed being, glides toward Peter and tentatively touches his brow.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an angel,\u201d Peter thinks, though he might have said it aloud, he isn\u2019t sure.\nThe creature laughs, a tinkling gurgle, as it gently wraps two tentacles around him and tugs him upward. As they break the surface, the creature who\u2019d pulled him up is already transforming, the freckles forming on his cheeks, and his beak softening back into two pink lips. Peter blinks, and the creature\u2019s face has once more become the barista\u2019s, his beautiful eyes still wide with concern. Beneath the water, though, the barista remains transformed, using his many tentacles to keep them both afloat.\n\u201cIs he all right?\u201d One of the group calls, they all stand at the bank\u2019s edge, looking down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the barista replies. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows how to swim!\u201d\nAnother man comes running up to the group, red faced and breathless. The barista calls to him, \u201cTim! Come and help me. This guy\u2019s getting heavy!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s starting to turn back,\u201d Tim replied. \u201cOi, keep his head above water, eh!\u201d\nThere is a searing sensation as the water enters Peter\u2019s mouth and nose. He doesn\u2019t know why the people on the river bank are not screaming, hurling rocks, or turning to flee in horror. Didn\u2019t they see that there were not one, but two monstrosities before them?\nTwo. Another, like him.\nAt that moment, Peter\u2019s world shifts\u2014he realizes he isn\u2019t dead, and he no longer wants to be. He begins thrashing, one hand slapping at the surface while his seven tentacles sway wildly under the water. Another splash sounds, as Tim leaps into the water, sprouting blue-hued tentacles as he falls. Then, he is helping the barista, and together, they pull Peter ashore.\nThe three of them lay panting, and Peter can feel his form solidifying, the tentacles coiling up, quietly caressing each other within his newly-formed, human skin. It hurts a little, a burning in his lungs, an aching behind his eyes, but already that is starting to fade.\nTim, who is already back to normal, helps the barista to his feet. They stare down at Peter, their fingers intertwined, their eyes piteous but kind.\n\u201cAre you okay, mister?\u201d The barista asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut I think\u2026 I think I will be.\u201d He gazes toward the rest of the group. All eyes rest upon him \u2013 they show no concern, or even take any notice \u2013 of the two men holding hands.\n\u201cIs there someone we can call?\u201d the barista asks.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no one.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d the barista and Tim exchange a glance. Then with a shy smile, the barista reaches out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Johnathan. This is Tim.\u201d\nTaking Johnathan\u2019s hand, Peter feels the warmth of another\u2019s touch \u2013 something he hasn\u2019t felt in so long. \u201cI\u2019m Peter,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nShort story author Tapanga Koe has published works in Mystery Weekly, Aurora Wolf, Asymmetry, and Euonia Review, and anthologies They Have to Take You In (edited by Ursula Pflug, Hidden Brook Press) and That Not Forgotten (edited by Bruce Kauffman, Hidden Brook Press).

In 1935, the Ermine\u2019s mother killed herself jumping into the river. Symmetrical, if anybody noticed. The terrible thing is that nobody noticed.\nIn 1936, eight members of a philosophy club disappeared. Their revolution was just a haze in the air between them; they barely knew what they were killed for. In 1937, somebody watching a battalion march the banners through the streets held indignation hot inside her chest. She even thought quietly: Damn you. In 1938, the Ermine twitched in his sleep.\nIn 1939:\nThe night before coronation, the Popess of Marrow came to a lapidary\u2019s workshop in a sedan chair white as a tooth. The link-boy held a red lantern. While the carriers hauled in heavy breaths, the link-boy opened the door of the litter. He took the Popess\u2019s four-fingered hand in its gauze glove. She alighted on the wet cobblestones like a lightning bolt strikes a tree.\nIn the gutter the rats cringed and fled. In the emptied city, unlit apartments shivered, in places nobody could see.\nThe lapidary Ina knew who had arrived. Her four candles flared all at once. The light careened through the thin diagonals in the ruby sealed into her polisher. To the eye they were barely a shimmer. Under a crystal loupe they looked like scars, but scars are inflicted on a body as it grows, so the body remembers its history. A crystal\u2019s imperfections are other things enveloped. Rutile crystal or bubbles of air, sealed in, remembering their own histories. Pending, holding themselves still. These inclusions were not air, or rutile, or any crystal that a secular lapidary would know.\nIf the Popess had any suspicions, the ruby would confirm them. There was no time to extract it. Ina took her foot off the pedal and the polishing lap-disc hummed as it slowed. She wrung her wet hands in her apron. She prayed for mercy.\nThe Popess of Marrow wore a plate of ivory over her face. The mask made not even the slightest allowance toward the hills and valleys of a nose and mouth. It was featureless, an oval panel, a blank. The Popess made a gesture. The link-boy said, \u201cMay I come in.\u201d\nIna stepped aside. The hem of the Popess\u2019s cloak had stained gray the instant she stepped out of the litter onto the stone.\n\u201cYou are Ina\u2014the apprentice of Ousef, who cut the Peerless Eye,\u201d the link-boy said that the Popess said. Her gestures, where they floated up from her sides, were no signed language; her face was too ceramic for grammar.\n\u201cThis is true,\u201d said Ina. Sometimes when Ousef drank he would say that name and weep.\n\u201cWe are grateful,\u201d said the link-boy. The Popess inclined her inscrutable head. \u201cMay he sleep peacefully.\u201d\nOne of the state oracles might have seen Ousef\u2019s death in the Eye. Peering into its birefacted realities through those many-louped headgear contraptions that made them look like upright insects. There had been just a small power in it before, as there was in all crystals, when it was claimed from a barbarian seraglio in the farlands. The rest was Ousef\u2019s fault. But, as he would sometimes say when he was drunk and weeping, what else was there to be done? When a Pope came to your door\u2026\nAnd then he had died\u2014seeing unprecedented visions\u2014jaundiced and sweating. No subterfuge or conspiracy even, so she could have sublimated her grief by blaming a rival guild, a piqued minor god, the machine of the state. It was his liver.\n\u201cHow may I serve you, Popess?\u201d said Ina.\n\u201cIn Ousef\u2019s memory, the Congeries has extended an invitation to you for the coronation reception. I will send you a litter tomorrow night. You will not need to be dressed appropriately; it would confuse the guests. Do not wear silver.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be my pleasure, Popess.\u201d\nThe Popess beckoned her link-boy and left the workshop. Ina\u2019s candles all went out as the door shut, and she sat in the darkness for a long time.\nA godawful hail rapped the roof of the sedan chair. The light was hushed by thick baize curtains that turned the space emerald.\nThe city straddled eight strands of a stinking river. Under the bridges they crossed, the water bloated with spit-colored foam. Patrolmen watched empty streets. They glared at the sedan chair from underneath awnings and salivated around the moist snuff in their lower lips.\nIna\u2019s childhood had unfolded across those courtyards. She and her cabinet of friends, who seemed to have come from nowhere. She could not remember how she met them. Their so-called toys salvaged from mysterious construction sites that were there and gone like mirages. Back then the city had been multiplex. The children lived in their own timeless layer where things happened around them for no reason. Now nobody had children if they could help it, and there were no coincidences.\nHail fell in the fountains and on the iron patio tables at the cafes where nobody smoked a cigar, nobody nursed an infant, nobody remembered the war. Somebody closed the shutters of their apartment window, far above the arcades.\nIna meditated on the appearance of gems under a microscope. They contained infinities of cosmic, hexagonal portals. She often imagined herself walking in those glowing landscapes. She avoided it before sleep. Lying with her eyes closed, in the silence, she could make the image so vivid she thought she\u2019d go insane. Sometimes she thought that wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\nShe envisioned, for instance, the ruby that she\u2019d sent off by courier that morning, which the Popess of Marrow might or might not have seen. If they suspected her of anything wouldn\u2019t they have sent the Pope of Vitriol and his smiling lieutenants? People said there was blood in the stomachs of those delimbed torsos that washed up on the riverbanks. As though they gulped down their fluids while the saw went through their necks.\nShe had a sore spot on her thumb where her hands had slipped during the lapping. The missed cut could have been aesthetic, or it could undo everything.\nThe color of a ruby made it an organic world. Inside the red guts of a great being, with the faint gurgles and thumping of distant breath. Maybe distant gulping-down.\nThe best quality rubies were of a color called pigeon-blood. She didn\u2019t know what had happened to the pigeon, but she supposed she might find out.\nThe Hall of St. Destin was old and peculiarly constructed. White banners stamped with the red Congeries icon rippled occasionally in drafts of unseen provenance. The atmosphere was not festive.\nThe Congeries opened the evening. Ina had never seen them all at once. Dressed in draping white, androgynously fluted, each wearing the full-face mask. As they filed in, their billowing high-collared coats took on the aspect of folded wings or the foamy wake of a swan. Their white heads were so motionless they looked like shaped tumors or extrusions on their shoulders. Like the heads were for show.\nThey stood just as any human could stand, lacking any kind of halo or nimbus, astonishingly mundane, at the top of the staircase. A boy in white livery delivered an uninspired speech on behalf of the gesturing Pope of Keratin and they returned to whatever chambers they spent their time in.\nA nervous string quintet played while everyone waited for the prince to arrive. No folk hymns in their repertoire. At one time or another, they\u2019d all been repurposed for rebellions. Certainly they could not play foreign or contemporary songs, universally degenerate. So the propaganda compositions were all that remained.\nThere were two songs she could barely distinguish even if they played one after the other. They were laughably mediocre. At the bottom of her heart, she believed the Congeries didn\u2019t understand music.\nIna was dressed the plainest. The aristocrats of the Synod Legislata, who stood in stiff clades, must have been thinking, What is she doing here? In a previous time, they would have been disdainful. They were fearful now. There were half as many synodites as last year. Anything strange might be a secret test.\nAt the top of the grand staircase, the synodite Doyen Zrin appeared, husky, hunched, adjusting his sleeves. The ruby glittered on his lapel.\nIna\u2019s breath left her all at once. The sore spot on her thumb panged. The delivery courier had gotten to Aspenrest in time. The ruby\u2019s guise had worked; the reception\u2019s security saw nothing. They had been lucky or blessed.\nZrin saw her and his eyes widened. This was a moment of such obvious conspiracy between them that Ina sought a discreet corner to put herself into, but she had no luck. Zrin sidled toward her. His elbows trembled in his too-tight evening jacket\u2014tailored for the size he\u2019d been three mysterious family disappearences ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here,\u201d he said. His pitch veered. Had he already been drinking?\n\u201cI was invited by the Popess of Marrow in Ousef\u2019s memory.\u201d She sipped her mead, although she didn\u2019t like it.\n\u201cHow lucky,\u201d Zrin said. They looked out into the sparse crowd.\n\u201cYou are ready to do it, then,\u201d Ina said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Zrin said, under his breath.\n\u201cAnd the price?\u201d\n\u201cOh, please. I\u2019ve practically been holding off for you. At least it won\u2019t hurt as much as falling on a pitchfork.\u201d He barked a laugh. Ten years ago, she would have been alarmed. Now she nodded. They\u2019d all gotten laissez-faire with their lives. In particular those, like Zrin and her, who no longer had anybody to defend or love. Zrin scratched his ginger beard. \u201cThough if I do it for nothing, it\u2019ll be a shame.\u201d\n\u201cDiamonds,\u201d said Ina, \u201chave fifty-seven facets. In other countries they cut fifty-eight now. They learned it from the easterners. The fifty-eighth facet shaves off the point. Without that fifty-eighth facet, even a diamond cracks, if the tip is damaged.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you find the tip?\u201d Zrin said.\nThe string quintet abruptly began the national anthem. \u201cGod\u2019s wounds,\u201d Zrin said. Through the threshold, under the garland of white lilacs, stepped the smirking boy-prince. Sergey, the Ermine. His skin, eyes, and hair were as pale as a human\u2019s could be.\nOfficially, he was twenty years old, but he was so tiny and smug that Ina realized immediately he could be no older than fourteen. Unless his brief stay in a Congeries shimmergaol, back when all this started, had stunted his growth.\n\u201cI should go,\u201d Zrin said. Ina had the urge to keep him at her side by grabbing his sleeve, but she couldn\u2019t ethically subject him to the Ermine\u2019s attentions.\nThe whole plot was concocted because of the Ermine. The Ermine took an interest in Zrin. An aggressive interest, as any child might take at the earliest cusp of his sexuality if he had power over all bodies.\nAt first it had been a thought experiment. Then it seemed they ought to do it instead of the foolish young soldier or defiant maid who might come later and throw a good warm life away. There was warmth even now in places the Congeries couldn\u2019t go.\nThe Ermine\u2019s head tilted when he saw her. Probably wondering why such an ugly dress was at his party. The aristocrats moved aside and murmured. It took her a moment to realize he was moving in her direction.\nAs he got closer she had to marvel at how white and spotless his skin was. As though every birthmark had been scrubbed away. And she saw, deep in the pupils of his quartz-cold eyes, that there was something else, a glint, an iridescence. Like certain images could be barely glimpsed in a crystal if you turned it the right way under the light.\nShe thought of the folktales of winter things that climbed into the mouths of infants. And she wondered what was living in the boy-skin. If anything at all.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said the Ermine, with disgust.\n\u201cThe Congeries invited me, Your Infallibility,\u201d said Ina.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nProbably so everybody could watch the execution, though who knew when that was scheduled. \u201cI\u2019m a lapidary, Your Infallibility.\u201d\nHis eyes brightened. \u201cWhat did you cut?\u201d\n\u201cNothing famous. Do you know the Somber Heart of Apland?\u201d A blood-black topaz; those who saw it felt intense grief. She didn\u2019t know what it was good for, really. She had nearly lost her sight over it. Nobody but Ousef had ever looked at it after she was done. Though that was her fault for making something so unpleasant to look at.\nSergey\u2019s expression told her that he didn\u2019t know it.\nIna said, \u201cMy mentor, Ousef, cut the Peerless Eye. He would have come but he died.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked in that,\u201d Sergey said. \u201cIt was a little boring. I would like to see some battles in it or something like that.\u201d\n\u201cNobody can control what they see in the Eye,\u201d said Ina.\n\u201cThey should cut another one that shows battles.\u201d His gaze drifted off her. \u201cHave you seen Doyen Zrin?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Your Infallibility.\u201d\nSergey left her without a farewell.\nShe was seated at the far end of the dinner table. On her left: a doyen whose known sexual controversies were inexplicably indulged. He was rapped on the knuckles by minor social reprimands like being seated at the far end of dinner tables. On her right: a general in a black jacket whose nervousness suggested the evening was not going well for him either.\nThe food was nothing to speak of, except for a fried tripe in thyme butter, a traditional dish somehow smuggled under the banal modernist taste of the Congeries. It was incredible. It broke Ina\u2019s heart.\nMost of the meal, Ina watched Zrin receive the Ermine\u2019s clumsy flirtations, threats and jabs. They were seated a few chairs apart at the head of the table. Zrin was not convincingly enamoured, but was more and more convincingly drunk.\nAs the minutes dragged on Ina plucked at loose strings and twitched when the Ermine laughed. Any moment she thought the Ermine might leap up and accuse Zrin of boring him. The penalty for that crime was surely too ugly to be imagined. Maybe she was meant to be here. There was no point waiting for Zrin to manifest an acting ability.\nShe rehearsed the scene she was about to perform a couple thousand times. In the intermission before dessert, Ina minced over to insinuate herself into the Ermine\u2019s awareness.\n\u201cYour Infallibility,\u201d she murmured over Zrin\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said.\nThis threw her off, but she said, \u201cI\u2019m the lapidary. We talked before\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t seem to find her familiar.\n\u201cI have a gift. Ousef made it\u2014especially for you. He asked me and Zrin to deliver it to you directly.\u201d\nZrin appeared somehow both relieved and terrified. It was distracting her. She needed the smooth quiet of the halls inside a ruby right now, but she had no space to imagine anything. The real presence of her body was too pertinent; she was very aware of her fingertips.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see it,\u201d the Ermine said.\nHere, she gambled that the Ermine, whether because he was fourteen, or because his consciousness had been amputated, was basically stupid. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it looks like a secular gem under the light.\u201d She gestured to Zrin, who unhooked his brooch and flashed it. His hands were clumsy; the gesture took too long. \u201cBut in the dark\u2026we could demonstrate.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean right now,\u201d the Ermine said. Suspiciously?\n\u201cOh, whenever,\u201d Ina said. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting, though, and it should only take a few minutes.\u201d\nZrin cleared his throat. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s very loud in here. It would be nice to talk alone.\u201d Finally he made himself useful.\nThe Ermine looked between the two of them. His expression was more vulpine than mustelid when Zrin spoke. Well, Ina remembered being fourteen too, wanting older men to want her. Wanting them to believe she was an adult. She\u2019d imagined herself twenty years old too. And after all, did the Ermine know any other children? How many other human beings?\nOr he was Congeries in a prince-suit, and he was gloating that they\u2019d stepped so quickly into their side-by-side nooses.\n\u201cSounds interesting,\u201d the Ermine said.\nWhen he left the table, the guards stepped to follow. The plan had a subclause for the security contingent, and Ina glanced at Zrin, who hadn\u2019t wanted any innocents to die. But the Ermine snapped his fingers and they stood down. Baffled, Ina met a guard\u2019s eyes by accident\u2014a ruddy boy of twenty-two or so who visibly repressed a sigh.\nIt wouldn\u2019t change the course of the plan, but it unsettled Ina. Because she recognized all in a moment that the guards were only there as government theatre, just like the lilacs, the string quintet, the fried tripe, the synodites, and every human in the Hall. The Congeries barely needed humans. They would have been completely happy governing a set of numbers on a page, fiat humans, like paper money stood in for gold.\nIn addition, it meant that the Congeries had some other way of keeping the Ermine from harm. Whatever it was, it was probably worse than guards.\nThe Ermine led them out of the ballroom, deeper into the candlelit Hall. Zrin\u2019s hairline was damp. He stunk of vodka. By the time they arrived in a windowless function room, he was running his tongue over his teeth.\nWas he losing courage? He murmured to her as they stepped into the darkness, \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to\u2026\u201d She shushed him. Did he think she didn\u2019t know?\nIna\u2019s hand hovered on the doorknob as she considered whether to seal the room. A needle of light still lay across the floor. Let the spell find no doorway. Let the whole hall be swallowed. Every cold flower on the lilac garland, every chuffed guard, the bones of the animals that had died for the feast in the bellies of the synodites who ate while others went hungry, the string quintet sweating over their paltry arrangements of notes. Let the hall\u2019s door be opened. Let the whole undoored country collapse into the ruby. The whole world. The ruby saw no borders. Let the ruby eat it all. \u201cSo what is it?\u201d the Ermine said.\nZrin clicked his brooch and cleared his throat.\nIt wasn\u2019t fair. There were others out there who hadn\u2019t decided to die. Crystals knew no names or mercies. They saw chambers, hallways, crossroads. Ina shut the door. The draft kissed the small hairs of her neck.\nShe had told Zrin from the beginning what he was agreeing to. But one could forgive him a little hesitation.\n\u201cWell?\u201d said the Ermine.\nZrin said, \u201cIna, I can\u2019t.\u201d\nHer blood went hard. Her bones poked the inside of her skin. \u201cYou coward,\u201d Ina said.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t even matter to them. They\u2019ll make another.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d the Ermine said, cross.\n\u201cYou think this is the weak point?\u201d Zrin said. \u201cThey\u2019ll pull another out of the air\u2014they\u2019ll say he had a brother. Look at him. You think this charade relies on constitutional authority?\u201d\nThe Ermine\u2019s eyes were wide; even he would realize. Did she see fear flicker across his face?\nShe knew what Zrin was saying was false. She couldn\u2019t say why. The memory was gone each frantic second she tried to pick it up, like water through the fingers of a cupped hand.\nZrin shoved him by the shoulders in Ina\u2019s direction. \u201cLook at him. He\u2019s just a boy.\u201d\nThe Ermine\u2019s white face had gone pink; he would shout. Zrin wouldn\u2019t be convinced. Well, who cared about anything. \u201cFuck you, Zrin,\u201d Ina said, and then, before Zrin or the Ermine could react, she said the cleavewords.\nThe ruby wailed and shattered, and the room collapsed. Conceptually, dimensionally. It left existence. All three of them went with it. What was left where the room had been: a featureless memory. An uncomfortable feeling in an adjacent hallway. A slight draft.\nIn the crystal-room of the ruby, Ina struggled up from a position she understood to be prone. Her inner ear rejected the whole endeavour. She tasted bile.\nThat sore spot on her thumb throbbed. The transit was unsurvivable. Some quirk of mineratics or that custom-order lap-disc? In her haste, she must have miscut the ruby by the most miniscule fraction.\nDidn\u2019t matter. She wasn\u2019t ever going to write a paper on it.\nThe Ermine was on his side, unmoving. His translucent skin refracted the inner light of the ruby into an arcane aura. She crawled to him, put her ear to his chest and discerned a weak heartbeat.\nThe possibility occurred to her that she had cut the ruby perfectly. He had just been protected by whatever the Congeries did to him. And as a side annoyance it had saved her too. Worse than guards indeed.\nZrin? No, she saw him around her. It wasn\u2019t a gory death; his body fractalled and complicated the walls. At the truest level, a body was a slab of many miniscule chambers, with molecular lintels and arches and soaring ceilings. Rubies were, too, though better organized.\nOn her knees, she held her aching head. There was no sound, but there were other distant vibrations, like the creaking plates of a submarine, that she felt through her shins.\nNot even the state oracles, with their regalia and their endless stock of prisoners to send exploring, could have found this space. It had no coordinates and no dimensions. Nothing was adjacent to it. It had no inside or outside. Theoretically, being here was as good as being dead, though on the downside she would have to spend a few weeks with Sergey the Ermine. Unless the two of them couldn\u2019t starve.\nHer head jerked up. Perhaps it was paranoia, but she swore flashes of white refracted around her in the red for an instant, shards of bone in meat. Her gaze drifted back down to the Ermine. His eyelashes trembled against his cheek like glints of moonlight in a mirror.\nIt was possible the Congeries could bring him back. Their capabilities were a mystery. Either way they had some kind of leash on this boy-skin they kept around. They could follow it right back here.\nSo\u2014she had to finish the job. Or all of this would have been completely pointless. She knelt over the Ermine, her head spinning. Like many children she had played weird games on insects as a child, with that cabinet of mysterious friends. Had those games been easy? What had she felt then?\nZrin couldn\u2019t have been right. Her certainty was stronger than ever. She rummaged up the memory from a dusty corner where she, everybody, had forgotten it. There had been a mother. A regent. She\u2019d died.\nAnd that had mattered. The lieutenants knocking politely on doors late at night. The riverbank bodies.\nA crowbar was wedged between the tendons of Ina\u2019s neck and it pried her skull slowly open at the base. She couldn\u2019t think. They had come here to do one thing. Even if it didn\u2019t work, surely she had to do that thing. Then, when the Ermine was dead, at least she could starve or go mad all by herself.\nShe curled her fingers around the Ermine\u2019s neck. But she couldn\u2019t convince her fingers to tighten. For many seconds, she held the Ermine\u2019s throat gently with both hands. How she\u2019d have held his head if she wanted to steady his spine, or prevent him from breaking. She\u2019d never wanted to be a mother, but children were so unrealized, undecided. The Ermine, if he was in there, had probably never made a real decision in his life. And his mother had died.\nThere was something sick about killing an unconscious person. He wouldn\u2019t even get the compensation of learning the things the living don\u2019t know, in those last seconds.\nMaybe he wouldn\u2019t be so bad to spend a few weeks with. Probably, at some point, he would weep, and she would have to deal with the fact that he was a child and terrified. Or maybe he would kill her; that wouldn\u2019t be a bad way to go, rather regal. Ina sat back. She pulled her gaze away from the Ermine\u2019s closed eyes with great difficulty, as if he were saying something profound and she didn\u2019t want to be rude. She put her face in her hands.\nAt first the Popess of Marrow was a cloud of shards, reflected in many incompatible facets of the ruby-room, among the Zrins. Then she had a hand to lift, and Ina heard something that was perhaps like the distant, toneless inner voice she heard when she read: \u201cNot this again. Is it worth it?\u201d\nAlready the Popess\u2019s voice had been recoded into an accent of comfortably familiar haughtiness in Ina\u2019s memory. But this wasn\u2019t what the Popess\u2019s voice sounded like; Ina could not hold on to what it sounded like.\nShe still sat on the Ermine\u2019s chest. Her whole body hurt too much to force it to move. When the Ermine woke up, she\u2019d figured, he\u2019d be motivated to help her off. Any amount of time could have passed since she\u2019d had that thought. Since then her mind had seemed dilute. Minutes or hours. Perhaps she had been thinking the one thought very slowly.\n\u201cI really did invite you as a guest of honor,\u201d the Popess said. \u201cAnd this is what you do. You people. You know, Vitriol is so disdainful of how few of you have done anything. But I\u2019m on the contrary, on your side, I think. Amazed at how many of you have signed up to die for no reason other than your horrid pride.\u201d\nIna\u2019s hands turned to red liquid. There was no pain. She fell forward onto the whole, unscarred stumps and laughed in shock. Her hair swung out from behind her ears and brushed the Ermine\u2019s face.\n\u201cWould you like to live?\u201d the Popess said.\n\u201cIn your fucked country?\u201d said Ina.\n\u201cHa!\u201d So\u2014they understood laughter. \u201cNo, I think not. But I could leave you in here,\u201d the Popess said. \u201cI could allow you a little room to wander. You dream of that, don\u2019t you? The telescoping spaces. Like basilicas. I\u2019ve been in those dreams.\u201d\nIna knelt up and rubbed her stumps on her thighs. She expected them to be numb, but they were much more sensitive than her palms had ever been, and it made her flinch. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. Not what she\u2019d thought she would say to the Popess\u2019s face. Give us our country back! She didn\u2019t have the energy for it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you all say,\u201d the Popess said. \u201cI would like to keep some of you. Like a museum to useless endeavours. I could put the music there, and the food, and so on. Pity.\u201d The Popess contemplated her vision a moment. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re going to be forgotten, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to take the Ermine back and close the coronation dinner\u2014which we kindly held for you, we couldn\u2019t care less!\u2014and everything will go on as before. We have provided everything for you. You\u2019re never satisfied.\u201d\nIna shrugged.\n\u201cThere are dozens of you who have died like this. A man set himself on fire outside the coronation hall a few years ago. Have you even heard of him? Of course you haven\u2019t\u2014the Popess of Plasma erased him completely. So what did he die for? What did he accomplish? I really want to know.\u201d\n\u201cEventually something will work,\u201d Ina said.\n\u201cOh-ho, I wouldn\u2019t be so sure,\u201d the Popess said.\n\u201cWe all try something. This is what I tried.\u201d The Popess was silent, watching her. Still feeling herself owed a better explanation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know why we do it,\u201d Ina said, \u201cI can\u2019t explain it to you. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, as you like,\u201d the Popess said. \u201cI will be gentle.\u201d\nIna felt nothing when it finished. Her last thought was, Who knows what will happen next year.\nThe Popess then spoke to herself, astounded, and sad. Her blank mask pointed at the Ermine. He lay in a pool of ruby-colored Ina; his eyelids twitched. Under there, perhaps he stirred, if he was still alive in some way. Even if one could hear her thinking, the Popess\u2019s style of mind would give nobody any certainty.\nShe said, \u201cYou all just won\u2019t stop trying.\u201d\nMeghan Cruickshank lives in Victoria, British Columbia.

Le Guin, to name but a few. The reason for this is, of course, that If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler is often regarded as one of the most important experimental texts in the last several decades. Specifically, the novel has inspired a number of genre-bending works in the literary landscape, serving as a catalyst for a relatively recent, yet still obscure genre known as \u201cslipstream.\u201d Slipstream, which is defined in a multitude of ways by as many people, functions simultaneously as a genre in itself as well as a literary effect \u2013 simply put, it is a style of literature that makes one \u201cfeel strange.\u201d In his groundbreaking novel \u2013 described by some as \u201cinteractive\u201d in a way not yet attempted by prior writers \u2013 Italo Calvino demonstrates a variety of tools, aesthetics, styles, and effects that parallel the qualities of slipstream, and thus the novel, as a postmodern work, makes a strong case for itself as a prototype of slipstream.\nSlipstream has been described as the genre of \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d (Kessel & Kelly, I); in other words: the ability to hold two contrary thoughts in one\u2019s mind at the same time. Throughout If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler, the reader \u2013 very much \u201cthrown into the text,\u201d which alternates between second-person and first-person narrative, thus creating a disorienting vicarious experience \u2013 is coerced into this dynamic of cognitive dissonance. As in the passage: \u201cBoth, seeing themselves counterfeited, have a violent reaction and rediscover their personal vein\u201d (Calvino, 170), the story\u2019s characters are confronted with a dualistic, contradictory sense of identity. Moreover, from this excerpt, the reader may wonder, \u201cAre these characters me? Am I rediscovering a \u2018personal vein\u2019?\u201d\nAdmittedly, writers of speculative fiction tend to use the term \u201cslipstream\u201d more than \u201cmainstream\u201d writers, the reason for this being that slipstream tends to employ fantastical, or supernatural, aspects \u2013 thereby distancing itself from \u201cmainstream\u201d fiction, or, in other words, fiction in which nothing \u201cimpossible\u201d happens. Bruce Sterling, the writer who originally coined the term, explicates:\nThe genre is not category SF [science fiction]; it is not even \u2018genre\u2019 SF. Instead, it is a contemporary kind of writing which has set its face against consensus reality. It is fantastic, surreal sometimes, speculative on occasion, but not rigorously so. It does not aim to provoke a \u2018sense of wonder\u2019 or to systematically extrapolate in the manner of classic science fiction. Instead, this is a kind of writing which simply makes you feel strange; the way that living in the late twentieth century makes you feel, if you are a person of a certain sensibility. We could call this kind of fiction Novels of a Postmodern Sensibility\u2026for the sake of convenience and argument, we will call these books \u2018slipstream'\u201d (Kessel & Kelly, VII).\nIf on a winter\u2019s night a traveler, often regarded as a postmodern work, shares some of these sensibilities, particularly in its at-times ambiguous fantasy aesthetic, in addition to its unconventional format. Indeed, some have opined that slipstream is merely the lovechild of postmodernism and \u201970s \u201cNew Wave\u201d SF\/F, a la Michael Moorcock, Samuel R. Delany, JG Ballard, et al.\nAt the heart of the discourse on slipstream lies the general disagreement about its validity as a subgenre or category of fiction. Some argue that it is more of a \u201cliterary effect\u201d than it is a \u201clabel.\u201d Editors James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel (of Feeling Very Strange: A Slipstream Anthology) expound on this dialogue: \u201c\u2018This could be SF if the science was better\u2019 or \u2018This could be fantasy, except it\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019s really magic happening or not'\u201d (Kessel & Kelly, pg. 38). Italo Calvino, in a cunningly indistinct manner, exemplifies this ambiguity in passages such as: \u201cI say \u2018should\u2019 because I doubt that written words can give even a partial idea of it\u2026 This is not because one cannot employ an imaginary sensation to portray a known sensation\u201d (Calvino, 129). Calvino implements this self-referential voice in order to achieve an effect that calls into question \u201creality of sensation.\u201d Sensation, one could argue, is inherently subjective \u2013 therefore, sensation is not necessarily real. Throughout If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler, vaguely fantastical literary devices achieve this confusing effect \u2013 a confusion that is also demonstrative of the postmodern canon to which Calvino is often aligned.\nIn keeping with the self-referential nature of If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler, the novel moves into metafictional territory. In the Feeling Very Strange anthology, the editors claim that:\n\u2026what often gets called slipstream in the genre seems to me to be work that is not just situated in, or straddling genre. It\u2019s work that\u2019s also about the genre in a certain way. I hate talk of postmodern self-awareness because I\u2019m a postmodern baby, and I think the term implies a callousness that is rarely present, but I think there is an astounding amount of play with conventions going on\u201d (Kessel & Kelly, 181).\nIronically, the self-awareness mentioned here does not lie solely within the texts of slipstream works. Indeed, Jeff VanderMeer, in his essay \u201cThe Romantic Underground: an exploration of a non-existent and self-denying non-movement\u201d talks about the trouble of assigning such genre designations to writers:\nAuthors being skittish at best, most apparently saw the umbrella as more of a trap and escaped without their names ever being connected to rumors of a vast but secret literary organization dedicated to the antithesis of anything popular, tidy, or, indeed, logical\u201d (VanderMeer).\nExemplary of this seemingly wide range of self-reference and self-awareness that seems to permeate the study of these works (both postmodern and slipstream), If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler toys with the tradition. Indeed, Calvino dares to insert his own thoughts about genre and story into story, such as in the following passage:\nI\u2019m producing too many stories at once because what I want is for you to feel, around the story, a saturation of other stories that I could tell and maybe will tell or who knows may already have told on some other occasion, a space full of stories that perhaps is simply my lifetime, where you can move in all directions, as in space, always finding stories that cannot be told until other stories are told first, and so, setting out from any moment or place, you encounter always the same density of material to be told\u201d (Calvino, 105).\nApart from the speculative facets that entrench slipstream into the fantasy and science fiction ghetto, the genre does make use of decidedly more postmodern \u2013 moreover, \u201cliterary\u201d rather than \u201cfantasy\u201d \u2013 tools with which to experiment. As Bruce Sterling asserts:\nIt\u2019s very common for slipstream books to screw around with the representational conventions of fiction, pulling annoying little stunts that suggest that the picture is leaking from the frame and may get all over the reader\u2019s feet. A few such techniques are infinite regress, trompe-l\u2019oeil effects, metalepsis, sharp violations of viewpoint limits, bizarrely blas\u00e9 reactions to horrifically unnatural events . . . all the way out to concrete poetry and the deliberate use of gibberish. Think M. C. Escher, and you have a graphic equivalent\u201d (Sterling).\nThe M.C. Escher comparison is especially pertinent, as the artist\u2019s disorienting style mirrors the surreal traits of If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler. Although the following extract from the novel is more tepid compared to its more experimental passages, it does parallel the M.C. Escher analogy: \u201cAll this, in any case, solely as a frame for my moods: a festive abandonment to the wave of events, or of withdrawal into myself as if concentrating myself into an obsessive pattern, as if everything around me served only to disguise me, to hide me, like the sandbag defenses that are being raised more or less on all sides\u201d (Calvino, 82). The meandering patterns, the geometrically dynamic aesthetic of Calvino\u2019s narrative, meet all the criteria of Sterling\u2019s further exploration of slipstream-esque narrative.\nThe fantasy element in If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler is often subdued, ambivalent. Most frequently, it is accomplished in self-reflection, or ambiguously distorted perception:\nYou immediately realize that you are listening to something that has no possible connection with Outside the town of Malbork or even If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler. You exchange a quick glance, you and Ludmilla, or, rather, two glances: first questioning, then agreeing. Whatever it may be, this is a novel where, once you have got into it, you want to go forward, without stopping\u201d (Calvino, 73-4).\nSimiles and metaphors, as in any other work \u2013 \u201cgenre\u201d or \u201cnon-genre\u201d \u2013 serve as instruments to manipulate readers\u2019 emotions and thoughts. However, the language here achieves a quasi-existential nature, setting a surreal tone. As Rudy Rucker points out in his essay \u201cA Transrealist Manifesto\u201d: \u201cIf, indeed, you are writing about immediate perceptions, then what point of view other than your own is possible? It is far more egotistical to use an idealized version of yourself, a fantasy-self\u201d (Rucker). This, again, supports the argument that all experience is subjective; therefore, in a manner of speaking, all experiences \u2013 skewed as they are by unreliable perceptions \u2013 are, technically speaking, \u201cfantasy.\u201d For that reason, even when a fantasy element isn\u2019t literalized in the narrative, it is nevertheless present.\nIn an online forum concerning the variety of fashions in which slipstream may manifest, Victoria de Zwaan argues that: \u201cMany advocates of the term think of this new \u2018genre\u2019 as what Brian McHale calls \u2018postmodernized SF,\u2019 while others\u2026 focus on stylistic and formal features exhibited in different texts, some in and some outside of acknowledged sf [sic], and sometimes implying that slipstream could be a sub-category of sf [sic] (or any other genre)\u201d (\u201cSymposium of Slipstream\u201d). While for the most part Italo Calvino in If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler drifts more toward these \u201cstylistic and formal features,\u201d there are understated speculative \u201cprops\u201d in the story, such as: \u201cWhile outside, beyond the frosted windows, the world full of people and of things would make its presence felt: the presence of the world, friendly and hostile, things to rejoice in or to combat. \u2026 I think this with all my strength, but by now I know my strength isn\u2019t enough to make it exist: nothingness is stronger and has occupied the whole earth\u201d (Calvino, 245). The implication is that the narrator has tangible power over reality\u2013and In typical postmodern fashion, the narrator\u2019s trustworthiness is questionable. Of course, the notion that thoughts can manipulate surroundings is intrinsically fantastical.\nMore obvious examples of fantasy, though still indirect, arise in If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler. The following excerpt, although seemingly metaphoric, interestingly enough does not employ metaphor: \u201cAlready she was sending me a message in which I could recognize her: that roiling of reptiles, to remind me that evil was the only vital element for her, that the world was a pit of crocodiles which I could not escape\u201d (Calvino, 110). The passage contains reptilian imagery, the effect of which may feel metaphorical, but stylistically is not. As a result, the denotative connotation becomes opaque. Is the reader looking at reptiles, or is this merely a poetic description and nothing more? Indeed, Rudy Rucker asserts the principal intentions behind fantasy traits in any work, subtle or not, which satisfy this contemplation: \u201cThe familiar tools of SF \u2013 time travel, antigravity, alternate worlds, telepathy, etc. \u2013 are in fact symbolic of archetypal modes of perception\u201d (Rucker).\nAlthough If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler does not qualify as a work that conforms to a \u201clinear\u201d or chronological structure, the following quote from Bruce Sterling is nonetheless relevant in the study of Calvino\u2019s novel as it pertains to slipstream:\nSome slipstream books are quite conventional in narrative structure, but nevertheless use their fantastic elements in a way that suggests that they are somehow integral to the author\u2019s worldview; not neat-o ideas to kick around for fun\u2019s sake, but something in the nature of an inherent dementia. These are fantastic elements which are not clearcut \u2018departures from known reality\u2019 but ontologically part of the whole mess; \u201creal\u201d compared to what?\u2019 This is an increasingly difficult question to answer\u2026 and is perhaps the most genuinely innovative aspect of slipstream\u201d (Sterling).\nSterling uses the word \u201cdementia,\u201d which perhaps best characterizes the following sentence from the novel: \u201cPerhaps it is this story that is a bridge over the void, and as it advances it flings forward news and sensations and emotions to create a ground of upsets both collective and individual in the midst of which a path can be opened while we remain in the dark about many circumstances both historical and geographical\u201d (Calvino, 80). Sanity, insanity, authentic experience, imagined experience \u2013 because of these imprecise attributes of the text, none of these is ever settled upon; thus, \u201cdepartures from known reality\u201d establishes itself as a primary thread throughout the book.\nPerhaps the strongest identifier of the slipstream \u201cseed\u201d in If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler is the narrative\u2019s focus on physical surroundings in an impersonal yet ontologically poignant manner. As Sterling ascertains: \u201cSlipstream is\u2026 marked by a cavalier attitude toward \u2018material\u2019\u2026 Frequently, historical figures are used in slipstream fiction in ways which outrageously violate the historical record. History, journalism, official statements, advertising copy . . . all of these are grist for the slipstream mill, and are disrespectfully treated not as \u2018real-life facts\u2019 but as \u2018stuff,\u2019 raw material for collage work. Slipstream tends, not to \u2018create\u2019 new worlds, but to quote them, chop them up out of context, and turn them against themselves\u201d (Sterling). An example of this in Calvino\u2019s novel: \u201cFor many years Cavedagna has followed books as they are made, bit by bit, he sees books be born and die every day, and yet the true books for him remain others, those of the time when for him they were like messages from other worlds\u201d (Calvino, 98). This excerpt presents a break in the narrative that follows a different character, adopts a different voice (borderline \u201cjournalistic\u201d or \u201chistorical\u201d in tone) that further illustrates the \u201cholistic\u201d approach to various writing styles that Calvino dips into from time to time throughout the story.\nWhile indisputably postmodern, and by turns matching up with the qualifications of a slipstream work, If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler nevertheless encapsulates the primary identifier of slipstream fiction: \u201cIt seems to me that the heart of slipstream is an attitude of peculiar aggression against \u2018reality.\u2019 These are fantasies of a kind, but not fantasies which are \u2018futuristic\u2019 or \u2018beyond the fields we know.\u2019 These books tend to sarcastically tear at the structure of \u2018everyday life'\u201d (Sterling). Just as often as unordinary events happen in the story, unordinary-ness is effected through the narrator\u2019s perception of events. In addition, Sterling concludes that: \u201c[s]lipstream does however have its own virtues, virtues which may be uniquely suited to the perverse, convoluted, and skeptical tenor of the postmodern era\u201d (Sterling). The perverse, the convoluted, and the skeptical are all present in the flurry of narrative, in ways that not only represent the loci of postmodern fiction, but also the DNA of slipstream fiction.\nIt would be challenging to have a conversation about slipstream without referencing Italo Calvino\u2019s If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler, which in so many ways qualifies as a work of slipstream (retrospectively, of course). The style, the surreal viscera, the uncertainty of reality, the ambiguous fantasy elements, the inherent subjectivity of perspective, the multidimensional postmodern approach to storytelling in the book \u2013 all these speak to a type of literature that pushes the envelope, that makes for an entirely new reading experience. And if there is one thing that Italo Calvino\u2019s If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler and slipstream fiction have in common, it\u2019s just that: they are entirely new experiences. But as has been showcased in both test subjects \u2013 experience does not equal reality. Due to these pronounced philosophical and aesthetic similarities, If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler indeed makes a strong case as a prototype, however liminal, of slipstream fiction.\nCalvino, Italo.

It was darker, colder, pinpricked by starlights near and far, not flooded by any near sun \u2013 but it had that same overwhelming sense of vastness, vacancy, disorientation. Lyuko was adrift. As ever, ze held to the light.\nThe open air on the arid planetside felt much thinner than water, offering strangely little resistance. But the light \u2013 the light in this strange land flooded into the emptiness, pouring down through the untrustworthy atmosphere in a relentless flow. It eddied over the sediment, catching on little stones and crumbly plants. In its shallows, it was buffeted by a sweeping current of air, a fierce movement, but still too insubstantial to affect the passage of photons. The light was pervasive and abundant. Lyuko would need all hir skill to coax subtlety from this dense light; ze might as well be working with stone.\nEverything else was thin here: dry, stretched, brittle. The drysuit skin felt just as thin; and the layer of pressurised moisture it circulated within flimsy at best. Wandering uncompressed under the atmosphere, the planet\u2019s residents seemed in danger of spindling clear away, twisting off into the pale dome of sky and vanishing, surfacing into still-emptier space. Lyuko had declined to stay any time in the cities. They were spindly, too, reaching ever upward. Once the drysuit had been fitted and tested \u2013 would its membranes stretch finely enough? could Lyuko still feel the sun\u2019s caress? could ze breathe, would hir skin stay moist? \u2013 and the hoverpack air-swimming technology had been procured, ze had gone straight to the open plain where the installation would be sited.\nLittle scrabbling creatures moved on the earthfloor below, nervous of the pressing heat of noon light. Lyuko preferred the hovering ones: little buzzing, diaphanous things that schooled and shimmered. Here, they were more graceful than ze could be; there was no elegance in this artificial propulsion technology, no finesse, not like true fluid movement. It was all artifice, and quite cunning at that, but lacking in artistry.\nAs ze began to carve and channel the light, the little creatures below took notice. Their lives were lived in total thrall to the sun\u2019s will; that will was now being bent. As shadow-paths formed, they were traveled by many day-shy, tiny, earthbound feet. Concentrated sunspots heated sluggish blood. Lyuko was left alone by the sentient species, at hir request. Their presence highlighted too keenly the absence of familiar faces. With the little schools and solitaires, the hunters and hunted, the stealthy and the bold, Lyuko was alone \u2013 but ze was not lonely.\nIn Voushato\u2019s seas, isolation had been rare. Solitude was easy to find, with free motion on three axes in the open water. But from the moment a new life budded from its parent, the colony was omnipresent, pooled together by the twin currents of genetics and time.\nLyuko grew out steeped in sculpture. Hir parent was a currents-artisan, twining temperatures and salinities through the delicate coral structures grown by hir budmates. Kouso was a master of hir craft, and hir first budding was widely celebrated. The colony hoped for a successor, another artist of extraordinary calibre from the same vaunted stock. Kouso nurtured Lyuko, garlanding hir with water-woven ribbons, creating still spheres and tumbling rills for hir to play inside once hir bud had cleaved. In these delicately shifting seas, Lyuko flourished: ze had the same fine skin-senses as all members of hir colony, and hir parent\u2019s eye for balance and beauty.\nOn a sleeping seamount, the coral architects trained a delicate, bone-white latticework into a swirling, tapering cone. Its lacelike branches spiralled upwards, their perforations converging in seemingly random clusters to form the shell\u2019s scattered portals. Kouso was channeling the waters in a counter-spiral. The cool and heavy deep-sea currents called up from far below were the scaffold through which sweeter, lighter waters wound. Scattered pearls of stillness would lead swimmers to the entryways.\nAs the work approached completion, young Lyuko spent more and more time at the site, often within the living coral shell. The interior was unformed, ambient water, disturbed only gently by the hushed murmur of movement beyond the lattice. It was light-dappled, but increasingly dim as the bulb slowly grew closed. Lyuko was dissatisfied.\nZe let hirself rise, barely buoyant, into the tapering tip. A little broken, blue light flickered down to meet hir. Ze reached for it, watching it play over hir skin. It tickled. Lyuko giggled, tugging away reflexively \u2013 and the light came too. Ze could see the coral\u2019s new growth clearly, now softly gleaming. Intrigued, Lyuko pulled again, and blue light blossomed within the bulb. Ze rolled it, spun it, and webbed the walls in soft blue lace. It was more pliant and responsive to hir touch than water alone had ever been.\nKouso was surprised, but overjoyed: hir child, a sculptor not of currents, but of light. The colony had never seen the like.\nLights bloomed in the deep. Threads of sun laced the colony\u2019s habitats, gracing them with illuminating warmth. In time, the offworlders came, sealed inside their sinking stone. They had an offer: a trip through the dark beyond the sun, to sculpt a spectacle of light and heat in a world without a sea.\nLyuko accepted.\nThe offer came, after the installation, to leave the bright, dry planetside: not for the watery embrace of Voushato, though, but for the unknowable currents of deep space. The contract was for an even larger sculpture. It would bend the merest whispers of distant starlight into an artificial lantern-moon, glowing gently down upon a habitat structure that slowly orbited a dead star. It would be a masterwork, a piece of such scale and subtlety that Lyuko could hardly envision it.\nThere were many questions to address. Could the drysuit be adapted for vacuum? Would Lyuko still be able to work the light under its enhanced protections? How would the galactic complexities of orbit impact the availability of light over time? If the sculpture were ever unlit, it would unravel as if it had never been. Higher theories of mathematics and engineering were needed than Lyuko could natively supply. In between consults, ze questioned hirself \u2013 hir skill, and hir courage.\nZe was still questioning as the shuttle launched. Gravity pulled at Lyuko through hir drysuit; it felt as if ze were puddling into the floor. Ze subconsciously adjusted for buoyancy, as one would if lost in Voushato\u2019s benthic zones, but couldn\u2019t equalise against the pull. Panic rose as the g-forces did.\nBut it was not Lyuko\u2019s first time in flight; ze had felt this before. And there would be worse things to fear, skin-to-skin with the abyssal expanse of deep space.\nA fortnight into the topside installation, Lyuko\u2019s drysuit broke.\nNot broke; slitted. Dry light was so rigid and the desert sun so strong that Lyuko carved it like shell, like bone. A stray shard sliced right through the thin material of the drysuit, and moisture hissed out as heat blazed in, scraping, shrivelling. The desert suddenly seemed very wide, and very, very empty.\nPart of Lyuko\u2019s awareness diffused outward, as if escaping with hir vital moisture. Ze saw hirself sink through layers of light toward the mottled, terra-cotta earth, body curling around the leak in the suit, trying to hold it shut. Ze reached camp. Containers scattered \u2013 rations, bedding, communications gear. Lyuko drifted, losing coherence. How long would hir spirit have to wander, before it found water to rest in? Who would finish hir sculpture?\nPhysical-Lyuko, far and tiny below, found the emergency kit amongst the mess and slapped a sealant patch on the drysuit. Ze snared the intubation line and hooked in, replenishing hir waters with a solution nearly but not entirely unlike Voushato\u2019s own. Ze opened hir eyes; there was dry dust settling around hir body, in which it would seem ze resided once more. Hir belongings were scattered, but hir suit was intact and refilling. Ze would live.\nFrom that point on, Lyuko was more careful of the light\u2019s glittering edges, and the patchkit stayed ever at hir side. The work grew into a searing, floating mandala. By day, the loops in the sky glowed bright enough to scorch the eyes \u2013 but below, the work was present in its inverse. Lyuko had wrought a labyrinth of shadows. Its paths were broad enough to allow one adult of the local species to walk, but not to pass another. Heatwaves mirage-warped the spaces between the shadows, blurring any view but the one ahead. There was a passing-space at the center \u2013 perhaps a place for refreshment, Lyuko would suggest, as well as contemplation \u2013 and then another path wound away, back to the ordinary, sun-soaked plain.\nAt night, the aerial sculpture was another work of art altogether. Its solar loops caught the low-angle shimmer of distant light; they shone in glimmering arabesques, writhing through the cool, quiet dark. The sinuous waveforms of Lyuko\u2019s homeworld were strange in this place. Ze was pleased, quietly, to be able to show this species something of a sea they\u2019d never know. It had been a long, dry stay. Ze was ready to go home \u2013 or so ze thought, until the offer came to swim the void.\nHanging in the darkness of space, Lyuko contemplated hir position. The drysuit-turned-voidsuit was working, keeping hir body from bursting in a flurry of frozen crystals. The suit thrummed, quietly warm. There was no other sound. Below, the habitat glittered faintly; somewhere behind hir, the ship and crew allotted to hir maintenance waited at a discreet distance. This would be no solo mission \u2013 it couldn\u2019t be. These aliens must be hir colony, now. Ze could feel the urge to bud; perhaps hir someday-offspring would carry the stars in their bodies, speak alien tongues.\nLyuko could feel the stars, distant as they were. With no atmosphere, nothing but voidsuit, between hir and their light, they prickled hir skin. Building these faint threads into anything substantially visible to the unseen lives below would take a long time, perhaps a lifetime. They must be gathered, combined, bounced one off another in resonating ricochets until each bright bundle was ready to be socketed into place. First ze would build the grid, the scaffold, the lantern-frame. Kouso had used the dense water of Voushato\u2019s depths as foundation for hir works. Lyuko planned instead to use light from the densest of the stars \u2013 a neutron star, thousands and thousands of light-years distant, further even than home.\nHere, Lyuko could move once more with perfect ease, with hir native grace. Ze reached \u2013 the suit provided coordinates, offered hir a guidance overlay. Ze switched the system off, and felt for the light ze needed. It buzzed against hir skin, tight and cool and ancient. Lyuko held the light, rolled it, spun it. It floated in space as easily as a light-line would have floated in one of Kouso\u2019s still-spheres. Ze placed the thread, gossamer in the darkness, and turned back to the star for more.\nThe work began.\nToby MacNutt lives and teaches in the state of Vermont.

His arms were corded tight with muscle and tangled ink that warded off bad luck, his hair was cut short against his scalp. Around him, a multitude of crafts bobbed and weaved across the river\u2019s oily surface. Ahead of him a three-decked behemoth teemed with vacationing offworlders, tiny skiffs like his own darting around it like busy insects.

He rested his hand on it as the river tugged him back into its heart. The air was hot and thick, beading his neck and arms with sweat. He could just make out the dance club from here, a great wooden structure that leant out over the river on five narrow stilts. The music thumped and swam towards him. He had earned well tonight, but if he climbed that ladder it would all slip away. A few rounds of drinks, some gambling, maybe a girl, and he would be as penniless as when he woke this morning. But what was this life for, if not pleasure? The river gave, and it took away. It was the way of things.\n\u201cUpworld bounty! Top dollar worldship!\u201d The boy turned towards the words, shouted from a skiff coming the opposite way. It was weighed down by offworlders, the pilot pushing hard against his pole. A fresh ship must have disgorged into the city, likely at Barker\u2019s Square. The passengers wore uniforms, their skin unmarked, and they watched him with the same open curiosity as the statues and shrines along the river\u2019s edge.\nThe boy considered the news as he pushed himself onwards. A top dollar worldship was a rare occurrence, and he would not fight the river\u2019s flow. He gave the club one regretful look as he passed beneath it, closing his ears to the music which pulsed down. Offering a brief word of thanks to Memnon-Tothep, the ten-eyed god of opportunity, he began to make his way towards Barkers Square.\nWord spread fast when ships like this one landed, and the water alongside Barker\u2019s Square was crowded with skiffs. Festivals and political speeches were often held here, though the only time the boy had paid it any mind was when the championship match was broadcast from the westernmost tower. He had cheered and screamed as loud as his lungs allowed, but still the betting house had taken a week\u2019s coin from him. He stood, bracing his bare feet on the wet wooden planks, trying to see if there was any hope of his finding a fare. Once more he thought of the club, of the music and drinks and girls. His course was set, though, and he sat down to wait.\nThe tiny boats bumped against each other in time with the river\u2019s heartbeat. The girl beside him was a fan of Boojum Jack the Crabman Detective, and they discussed the latest story at great length. The serial was the only part of All Action Quarterly the boy had any interest in, and he had spent many a penniless night hunched beneath the lantern in his lodging house, reading the cramped text and admiring the brief, colourless illustrations. He had not yet found the latest issue, and did not know how Boojum could escape the pit of torture the offworld smuggling ring had cast him into. Smiling with affected shyness, the girl suggested that he come by her rooms to borrow her copy the following night. The boy agreed that this was a fine plan.\nThere was a burst of angry voices from the square, and a disruption shaped like a woman swept through the crowd of skiffs towards him. She stepped heavily from one deck to the next, leaving them rocking crazily in her wake. An offworlder. A sharp bolt of adrenaline coursed through him as she pivoted in the air and crashed to a halt on the bench behind him. \u201cGet us out of here, would you?\u201d she said through a lopsided grin. \u201cI don\u2019t think I made any friends on my way here.\u201d\nThe boy was not so shocked as to forget how such transactions worked, and he merely watched the woman stone-faced. She sighed and dug inside her jacket, pulling out a chit and tossing it to him.\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said, \u201csame again when I get off.\u201d The boy hoped that his eyes did not bulge at the amount that she had given him, and he nodded enthusiastically, the girl in the other skiff forgotten as he pushed away from the crowd.\nThe woman relaxed as they slipped into the current, and the boy tried to work out what the river had brought him. He examined her in the scratched little mirror set in the prow, nestled among good luck talismans and the long curve of a merwhale rib. She looked very fine, he thought, very tall and powerful, her long dark hair swept back and tied behind her head. She wore a grey uniform with a high collar and boots which reached her calves. He did not try to interpret the insignia that shimmered at her breast and shoulders \u2013 one offworld army was much the same as another. At her waist hung a sword, a long straight blade with a covered grip.\nWhen his eyes flicked back to her face she was watching him with a soft smile. \u201cYou like that? It\u2019s called a sabre. Part of the whole dress uniform.\u201d She ran a hand over the hilt, and the boy saw that she wore white gloves despite the night\u2019s sweltering heat. \u201cAwkward thing, really. Pretty, though, and deadly enough if you\u2019ve got nothing better.\u201d\n\u201cHave you killed anyone with it?\u201d he asked, unsure if this was what she wanted to speak of but willing to follow where she led.\nThe woman looked down at the blade, elegant features contracting briefly. \u201cWith this? No.\u201d She looked pensively over the bow, and the boy cursed. Angered customers were poor tippers.\n\u201cYou have many medals,\u201d he offered hurriedly, \u201cyou must be very brave. Must have killed many of your enemies.\u201d\nThat raised a chuckle from her. \u201cPerhaps. Hard to tell. These are more for\u2026doing what you\u2019re told, you know? You don\u2019t know who\u2019s out there, you just set up your shots and loose them off, proton banks and arc generators and all. Dots on the sensors. You never even see the kill. Or the killer, if it\u2019s your day to go.\u201d\nThe boy glanced upwards, as though he might see these titans warring above his head. The sky was cloudless, the stars peaceful and still. \u201cYou must be very brave,\u201d he said again, not knowing what else to say. The woman did not respond, and he returned his gaze to the river. A priest\u2019s barge drifted ahead of them, trailing red and purple feathers behind an intricately carved hull.\n\u201cWhere would you like me to take you? We have left the square behind, and there are many sights to see this beautiful night.\u201d\nThe woman leaned back in her seat, giving no sign that she contained the dervish who had bounded across the maze of skiffs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What do people like me do?\u201d\nThe boy held the skiff still for a moment as a long police catamaran heaved into the water ahead of them, metallic faces scanning blankly in all directions. \u201cA lot of women go to the Queen\u2019s Rest. It\u2019s just ahead of us, right before the Noble Bridge. The prettyboys dance there.\u201d The boy had a whole sales pitch prepared \u2013 the proprietor of the Queen\u2019s paid pilots for every fare dropped at her establishment \u2013 but tonight his tongue was still. Curiosity pulsed beneath his skin, as hot as the air that pushed around them. He had ferried half a hundred offworlders up and down the river, but something unique glinted beneath this woman\u2019s surface. A stone in the river\u2019s sand.\nThe offworlder did not reply, and he glanced towards the mirror. A group of crabmen were foraging in the shallows, clicking and clattering in their nonsense langue and holding up trash in their mandibles. The boy shuddered and looked away. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cthat such a beautiful woman should have to see such unpleasantness on our world. They are shameful creatures.\u201d\nThe woman shook her head, eyes momentarily clouded. \u201cThere\u2019s more than that to apologise for,\u201d she murmured. \u201cTake away everything from someone and you make an animal. The only one with anything to feel bad about is the one doing the taking.\u201d\nThe boy did not understand what she meant, and said nothing. The Queen\u2019s Rest loomed beside them, a pink and gold fa\u00e7ade that glowed in the dark. \u201cShall we stop?\u201d he asked, lips clumsy with reluctance.\nThe woman glanced up at the hard-bodied young men that hooted and waved from the balconies. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cPush on.\u201d\nThey said nothing as they passed beneath the Noble Bridge. The faces in the eaves had long, lolling tongues, and passengers often asked him what they meant. He invented a different story every time. In truth he did not know their meaning, nor did he care to \u2013 such things were for the high folk in their glass towers. His world was made of mud and water. The sides of the bridge were painted annually, just before the Feast of Awakening and Mirth, but the underside was bare boards and trash. The woman did not ask about faces, nor did she comment when several of the boy\u2019s friends shouted down at them. He ignored them and bent to his work.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d asked the woman suddenly, as they emerged once more into the moonlight. \u201cMy name\u2019s Laila. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\u201cI do not have a name,\u201d She did not reply, and he felt compelled to fill the sudden silence. \u201cThere are so many boys of my caste. To name us would be\u2026unnecessary. We are not seen.\u201d He had never described such things aloud \u2013 nobody of his own world would need him to, and no offworlder had ever thought to ask. \u201cIf we achieve great deeds, we may be named by those who witness them. Those who raise us up. A nickname, you would call it. It would become our name. Then we would be seen.\u201d He had heard of it happening, but never seen it with his own eyes.\nLaila grinned at him again, and he could not tear his eyes from her reflected image until she looked away. \u201cI\u2019ll call you Captain, then.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain?\u201d The boy did not understand, and he wondered if she were making fun of him.\n\u201cSure!\u201d she tapped the palms of her hands on the outside of the skiff. \u201cThis is your vessel, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re the captain. It\u2019s as good a name as any, and I should say that you\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\nThe boy tried to shrug her words away, but they lodged in him nonetheless. He whispered the word to himself. \u201cCaptain.\u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cIt is not I that drives her, but the passenger. I am more\u2026a part of her.\u201d\nLaila fell quiet, and the boy said no more. He boy closed his eyes, feeling the boat rise and fall beneath his feet, the soft silt giving way beneath his pole. He listen to the city buzz and rumble around. \u201cI came here to get a medal. Another one\u201d She was slouched low in her seat, one glove removed and fingers trailing through the gloomy water. \u201cNot here, exactly. The nearest artificial world. Galileo. It orbits your star, it\u2019s where most of the officers you see here are on leave from.\u201d The boy knew of it, but did not interrupt. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for \u2018valour under fire\u2019. Bravery. Killing more of them than they killed of ours.\u201d\n\u201cWho are \u2018they\u2019?\u201d He did not know if he was supposed to speak, but it seemed the only thing to say.\nLaila shrugged. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m really not sure. The ship designates threats and we engage them. It all moves so fast, the politics of it all, there\u2019s confederacies forming and breaking up all the time. More than anyone can keep up with, especially while running a ship. It all gets updated from Central through the relays, we just blow up the ones they tell us to and leave the ones they don\u2019t.\u201d She lifted her fingers, watching the water run over her wrist. \u201cOne time, we were lining up for a full strike, moments away from loosing, and the designator turned from red to green. Five seconds later and it would have been too late to recall, and they would have been dead for nothing.\u201d She flicked away the drops and pulled her glove back on. \u201cEven more so than usual, I mean.\u201d\nThe boy looked at his hands as he punted, knuckles marked from brawling and palms from the pole. Her words were a fever dream, and as she spoke the sky filled with nameless monsters. They were like the swarm gods of the crabmen, the reaching hungry arms that lived in the mountains at the river\u2019s source.\nThey were drifting clear of the commercial district, the cacophony of the market replaced by hive pyramids and ghetto towers. The boats that passed them moved with purpose. He had still had no destination from his passenger, and he was about to ask her for one when she spoke again. \u201cHave you ever killed anyone, my captain?\u201d\nHe nodded, but did not speak. Perhaps he would be permitted to leave the matter there. \u201cAhead of us is the Temple Beneath the Waves, one of the few relics of the old empire. There are no waves here, of course, though some say that before the terraforming\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHang on.\u201d The edge that drove a worldship\u2019s crew blossomed in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m the passenger, and I don\u2019t want the tourist shit. I want to hear about the time you killed someone.\u201d\nThe boy had lived a lifetime of obedience. \u201cIt was many years ago. I was in a lodging house and it was\u2026it was not a good place. There were many fights. No deaths, but always the smell of it. I was tall for my age, bigger than the top boy there, and I think he thought I was a threat. One night he came for me. I do not think that he meant to kill me, but I was as afraid as if he were. I fought, I took his weapon from him\u2026I do not remember the rest. But he died.\u201d He thought about the pieces of glass and bone beneath his soles, his hands and forearms slick and sharp with pain. It had not been an easy thing, to kill the top boy. He had not gone quietly.\nHe waited for horror that did not come. Instead, Laila looked out at a pair of crabmen sitting chest deep in the water, gazing towards them with the big eyes of the inebriated or dead. \u201cThat sounds like a good reason,\u201d she said at last. Then she shook her head and clapped her hands together, and the energetic creature who had bounded into his skiff was birthed again. \u201cEnough of this! Enough of the dismal. Where can you and I go to be alone?\u201d\nThe pole skidded across the riverbed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nShe grinned rakishly. \u201cYou heard me, captain. C\u2019mon, you\u2019ve got to have some secret place that you like to take girls after you tell them about killing people. You told me that this craft only goes where the passenger wants. Forget that. Take me somewhere that you want to go.\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s arms were straining before he fully understood what she had said. Her words were as shocking as they were compelling. Were they all so impetuous, these offworlders? He let the river sweep him along, past the pyramids, deep into the darkening west of the city. They left the other skiffs behind, until only planetsiders passed them, great multitier residential craft that sat low in the water and workmen hurrying home in simple dinghies. The grand architecture of the commercial district gave way to squat hives and crowded ghettoes. The occasional Yggdrasil loomed between them: a previous generation\u2019s terraforming experiments gone wonderfully wrong, now shouldered human structures aside to stretch their green and brown fronds skywards.\nThere was one Yggdrasil in particular that the boy was making for. It extended out over the river, roots woven deep into the water and the soil. His pole stumbled across them as he approached its bulk, though he knew every surface and obstacle of the river\u2019s bottom, as a blind man knew his home. He took her by the hand and led her up the stairs worked in the trunk. Time worked strangely, as though he were dreaming or high, and before her knew it they were in the small cabin that overlooked the river. There was a simple cooker here, a window and a bed.\nHe and some friends had found this place just a few months ago, drifting lazing on a raft and letting the river take them where it would. They had been coming here ever since, to drink together or to be alone. He had never seen another person here, and wondered if this would be the night that he was caught. If it was, it would be worth it.\nHe did not have time to ask her what she wanted to drink before she was on top of him, strong hands running over his limbs, guiding his hands to the clasps on her jacket and within. As they fucked he could feel the metal shifting under her skin, and shivered at the knowledge that she could break his arm without effort. She mounted him, something that the river girls had never done, her dark hair spilling over them as she grunted explosively. Her breasts were small and high on her muscular body, and her eyes flashed bright in the dim room. He did not last long, and she laughed and kissed away his garbled apologies.\nAfterwards, they stood at the window and gazed down at the thick curve of the river beneath them, teeming with vessels and strangely silent from this distance. She looked across the water at a hive, its thousand inhabitants clearly visible through windows left open in deference to the sweltering heat. \u201cKind of makes a mockery of the idea of privacy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d The boy did not know what she meant, and he said nothing. Eventually she spoke again. \u201cI\u2019m mustering out in a few months. Putting together a crew. I\u2019ve got my eye on a ship already, just need the hands to keep her in the air. We\u2019ll need a ship\u2019s runner. Someone quick and small and clever. If you\u2019re interested.\u201d\nThe world was suddenly a big and silent place. The boy boggled at her, trying to see the trick, the angle by which she meant to rook him. He had nothing for her to steal, and would give her anything physical she might ask. He had heard tales of the cruel perversions of offworlders, but in that long, naked moment he discovered that he believed her. \u201cWould I have to\u2026\u201d his eyes went to the bed, and she shook her head rapidly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, her eyes serious. \u201cNever. Unless you wanted to.\u201d She smiled once more. \u201cAnd I hope very much that you will.\u201d\nHe looked back out at the river. He could see it all laid out from here: the bridges, the markets, the statues and the docks. This must be how the high folk in the towers saw the world, he thought; no wonder they also saw themselves as master of it. He thought of the money not yet made on the river, the girls not yet wooed. He had many years left as a skiff pilot; then what? He had never thought farther than the next fare, the next drink. What she was asking of him seemed impossible.\nHe had suffered greatly in this life; been hungry more often than not, and suffered more often than not. But this was his home \u2013 could the river truly mean to guide him away from it entirely? Who would he be without it. He could already feel an ache in his heart the shape of his pole.\nLaila put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI grew up on a forest world. We lived on my father\u2019s estate, and every day my sisters and I would run through the forests and play. Building forts, chasing animals, finding secret places that we could call ourselves the masters of. I haven\u2019t seen a forest like that in twenty five years, and there\u2019s not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t close my eyes and think about the feeling of bark underneath my hands, or of dead leaves beneath my feet.\u201d\nThe boy nodded. He had never been to a forest, but he thought that he understood. \u201cBut you push on?\u201d\nShe smiled and nodded. \u201cI push on.\u201d\nThe boy that she had named captain looked at his arms, at the story of his life etched in ink. His life, such as it was, was entirely predictable. The river only led one place, after all. The bars were full of skiff pilots who had not saved their money, as he had not, who had not prepared for the passing of the years.\nThe boy pressed his hands against the cool, smooth glass, looking down at the river once more. He traced its path with his eyes, under the Noble Bridge and along through the markets, swarming and turgid and dark. He watched his people passing back and forth, the currents taking them as it would. As his eyes traced its length, he realised that it did not lead to the ocean, not when seen from here. It ran up through the Narrows and the Eight, cramped between the construction and the boiling vortices, then spreading wide and golden towards the city\u2019s edge, spilling upwards further still. It became black and clear and bright, and it was full of stars.\nAlexander Hardison is a Sydney based writer just a tiny bit past thirty, a lifelong fan of comics and science fiction as well as a fresh convert to the world of professional wrestling.

The dark pub smelled of hops and fried fish.\n\u201cHave I steered you wrong yet?\u201d Sean shoved the tablet across the table and pointed at the screen. \u201cThat\u2019s real Octo tech. And whatever it is, it\u2019s big.\u201d\n\u201cYou said that about the Talarnian islands and I spent a week diving in frigid water for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cShit, you call two grand nothing?\u201d\n\u201cIt sure wasn\u2019t the mythical Drowned City of the Octos like you promised. There were, however, flocks of other scavengers looking for the same thing as well as extremely hungry sharks the size of city buses.\u201d\n\u201cJust look at it.\u201d He hit the screen on his tablet and it lit up with a soft hum of music.\nMati already knew she was going to take him up on his information. But she was going to give him as hard a time as she could so he didn\u2019t see the old excitement glittering in her eyes and demand a forty percent cut of her hard work.\nWith a narrow-eyed glance of suspicion, she took the offered tablet. On the screen was a map of Marine, a planet a bit closer than New Erin to the central worlds, but not by much. Salt water covered ninety-seven percent of Marine\u2019s surface. The only land to be found was dormant volcanos and big chunks of jutting rock that passed for islands. Parts were frigid, lifeless, glacier filled hellholes while others were sweltering nightmares that sucked the water from your body and fed it right back into the hungry oceans.\nThe expanse of blue where Sean pointed was somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Vast swaths of cool seas and rocky islands inhabited by seals and hardy sea birds. Not all that different from home.\nShe raised an eyebrow and Sean tapped the screen, zooming closer to the site. And there it was. A mass of glowing purple dots. Her heart danced and her blood rushed in her head like crashing waves. But she had to stay cool. \u201cI suppose it might be Octo tech.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play that coy game with me, Mat. That\u2019s definitely Octo tech and whatever it is, it\u2019s fucking huge.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. It\u2019s Octo tech. But it could be a massive ship or, and more likely, it could be shards of metal scattered all over the island. How\u2019d you come to learn about it anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI got my ways. You interested or not?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, alright. It\u2019s worth checking out anyway. Give me the coordinates.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t negotiated price, yet. I get fifty percent of whatever you find.\u201d\nStarting with fifty percent. He must be certain she was interested. Or very excited about his cut of whatever what she might find. \u201cNot a chance. I\u2019m the one risking my life. Ten.\u201d\nThey haggled back and forth and Mati was more than happy when they settled on twenty-five percent. He scrawled the coordinates down on a napkin.\n\u201cHow many others know about this?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn, Mati. I told you, I\u2019m giving you the exclusive here.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you say, Sean. But you heard it from somebody. How much of a fight should I be prepared for?\u201d\nSomething flashed across his face. Fear? Guilt?\n\u201cI like you. I\u2019m rooting for you. I want us to bring back loads of money and flip the bird to those assholes on the central planets. So, you should know you aren\u2019t going to be the only one looking. I got pretty good word that there are some private contractors on the scent.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean mercenary thugs.\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. I got my money on you though. New Erin breeds \u2018em tougher than those coddled assholes.\u201d\nSean left and Mati finished her beer and ordered another. Dread soured her excitement. Caryl was not going to be happy about this. She drained the second beer and stood. A little tipsy and insulated in a warm bubble of booze, she stepped out into the cool, misty air.\nThe light in their little window glowed bright. She should go home and tell Caryl, but she wanted to sit with the excitement and possibility stretched out ahead of her before Caryl could quash it with her loving concern and pragmatism. She wandered out to the steep cliffs and looked down at the crashing, foaming sea below.\nGod, but she loved the sea in all its violent beauty. The waves that broke on the knife-sharp rocks, the blubbery seals and whales that soared and sang through the currents, silver fish with gill slit throats darting from the ravenous teeth of sharks. Even the barnacles that clung to docks and the strange, alien life in the deeps. She grew up on the ocean shore, living at its mercy as the child of a fisherman, and she couldn\u2019t seem to pull herself away for long, not even for warm skin and sweet kisses.\nShe breathed in the salty air and prayed her goodbyes to the sea of her home world and wandered up the path to the house she shared with Caryl.\n\u201cYou can find other work.\u201d Caryl sat at the edge of the bed buttoning her shirt. The frayed edges hung down to her chaffed knuckles.\nMati rolled onto her back. This was going how she expected, although not how she\u2019d hoped. \u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cGwyn is hiring. She\u2019s looking for a mechanic. Even said she\u2019d train someone who showed an aptitude.\u201d\n\u201cDid she, now?\u201d\nCaryl stood and crossed the room. She twirled her short red hair around her finger, creating soft curls from the frizz. \u201cDon\u2019t use that tone. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a mechanic. Mechanics get a steady paycheck.\u201d\nMati put her head in her hands. \u201cI could work for Gwyn the next fifty years of my life and we\u2019ll still be cooking up scraps for dinner and ducking the landlord come the first of the month. If this works, we could be happy.\u201d\n\u201cI thought we were happy now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I love you. I am so happy with us. But, if we had money we could do something with our lives besides fret and struggle to make ends meet. We would be happier.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if you never come back, huh? How happy will I be then?\u201d\nMati looked down at her hands. She spun the silver band Caryl had given her. The only piece of jewelry she hadn\u2019t hocked for gear or a lift to some other ocean that might hold riches. It was tarnished and it turned the skin underneath it gray. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back you can sell off my piano. It\u2019ll get you through until you can find a roommate.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\n\u201cCaryl, this is who I am. This is me. I was a scavenger when you met me.\u201d\n\u201cI know that. But we were kids then. I thought it was romantic. It\u2019s time to accept that you\u2019re just not going to make that big find and it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll still be you.\u201d\nMati\u2019s heart ached. Sitting there, looking at Caryl, she wanted to say anything that would make the tears glittering in her grey eyes go away. But the crash of the waves and the salt of the sea was stirring in her heart and when the sea got to calling, there was no turning back.\n\u201cI love you so much. But no, Caryl, I wouldn\u2019t still be me. I\u2019m sorry. I have a transport to catch in an hour.\u201d Mati tossed her bag over her shoulder and turned to leave.\n\u201cI love you too. Come home safe,\u201d Caryl said, her voice soft and raspy.\nThe knot in Mati\u2019s stomach loosened. \u201cI will.\u201d\nMati spotted a massive, bulbous shape on her boat\u2019s sensors. She steered towards a small island formed of jagged rocks.\nThere it was. A pristine, intact Octo ship.\nMati shook herself. It was hard to believe it was real. The ship sprawled, tentacles wrapped around the outcropping rocks, as if waiting for her. The hull was bright yellow with splashes of electric blue. It was beautiful, breathtaking even. It would be the most stunning find on record and she didn\u2019t even have to dive or fight for it. She and Caryl would never want for anything ever again.\nShe pulled her own boat up onto the beach. She strapped her battered toolkit to her waist, hopped over the side, and crept towards the ship. There was no telling what kind of defenses it might have.\nVoices echoed across the tiny island. She gripped her dive knife. If she had to, she\u2019d hop on and leave her rental behind. She could afford to buy the boatman a new one.\nShe circled the ship, searching for an entrance, but the sides were hard and smooth, with no doors, hatches, or entryways that she could find. She ran her hands across the warm, metallic surface and the ship moved. Pebbles crunched and tumbled out from under it as it swelled like a great beast taking a deep breath after a long hibernation.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find this ship is ours,\u201d said a crisp voice.\nMati turned to see a man, clad in a slick, black dive suit. A similarly dressed woman joined him. Both had shaved heads and skin leathered and cracked by the sun. Scavengers, like herself. But given their pricy gear, scavengers with a corporate and state seal of approval.\n\u201cRules of scavenging. You know sure as I do. Finders, keepers. And I got here first.\u201d\nThe woman stared at the ship, her eyes as wide and greedy as Mati felt. She shook her head. \u201cLike my brother said, ship is ours. Step off, roach.\u201d\n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Mati took an angry step forward.\nThe pair stood fast as if expecting their money, scorn, and determination to be enough to make her back down.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t going anywhere. This ship is my find.\u201d\nThe man moved so fast that all Mati saw was a streak of silver and then something slammed into her stomach. Her body jerked and she collapsed onto the rocks.\nFor a long moment, she couldn\u2019t move. The waves crashed against the shore in a hypnotic, concussive, rhythm. Her finger twitched and then her toes began to tingle. She pulled herself up on her hands in spite of her throbbing head and aching body. The pair attached towing chains to the Octo ship, paying her no mind. The man had a prod hanging from his belt. The kind meant for scaring off the thirty foot sharks that swam the waters of Marine. They had probably written her off as dead.\nShe tried to stand, but her knees buckled and she vomited hot yellow bile into the cool, rocky sand. Her throat burned and she tried to cover the sound as she coughed up the last of her stomach contents.\nHer own boat still hovered just off the beach. She could jump in and sail off. The scavengers would get the ship and she would go home to Caryl who would nurse her injuries and then insist she take that job with Gwyn. They\u2019d spend their days bickering over pennies until they worked themselves to death. Just like both their parents.\nShe pulled out her dive knife and snuck towards the Octo ship. Her head spun and her legs threatened to collapse under her, but as she walked, she took in deep breaths and grew steadier. Keeping one of the impressive tentacles between her and the other scavengers, she crept towards the lines they\u2019d attached. When she saw they were too focused on the task at hand to notice she\u2019d gotten up, she swiped at a line with her knife. The blade clanged against the metal and the line frayed. A second slash cut it in two.\nWhen she cut the third line, the pair noticed.\n\u201cGoddamnit.\u201d The man jumped into his boat and started pulling the Octo ship out into the water.\nThe woman splashed through the waves towards Mati. There were still two lines holding the Octo ship to the other vessel. Mati held her knife tight in her sweaty hand and ran towards the remaining lines. The woman reached the beach and charged towards her, electric prod in hand.\n\u201cFuck. Please open. Please, please, please. Where is your door?\u201d Mati yelled at the Octo ship.\nThe ship swelled again and Mati heard soft, strange music. The front of the ship opened like a hungry beak and Mati ran towards it.\nShe jumped into the opening and the music grew louder. Crashing, rushing, humming. It reminded Mati of watching a storm spit rain into churning waves. The scavenger woman\u2019s panting breath was close behind.\nThe woman lunged with the prod just as Mati turned to face her. Mati jumped back out of reach and held her dive knife out in front of her body, thrusting sharply whenever the woman tried to move in closer.\n\u201cThis is my ship. I found it first. Get off,\u201d Mati said.\nThe woman circled Mati in silence. She shot her arm out towards Mati, testing, searching for an opening or a moment of inattention.\nThe Octo ship jerked and scraped on the rocks. The other scavenger was going to pull them out to sea whether they were still onboard or not.\nThe woman stumbled and thin, transparent tentacles squirmed from the floor and wrapped around her feet. Mati slashed out with her knife and cut through the black wetsuit, down to the skin on her belly opening a wound that leaked blood onto the thin, fleshy, roiling floor.\nThe ship continued to slide. The scraping of rocks gave way to a splash and then the gentle rocking of the water. A jerk threw Mati into the other woman and the woman brought the prod down towards Mati\u2019s back, just as Mati shoved her. There was a sound like wet cardboard ripping as the blow and gravity pulled the woman from the ship\u2019s clinging grip. The prod glanced off Mati\u2019s arm, which spasmed and went numb as the woman fell out the door and into the water.\nMati remembered how the ship had opened at her words. \u201cClose the door. Take us home.\u201d\nThe music swelled and a deep, booming voice sang in an alien language. It grew louder until it rumbled deep in her chest.\nThe ship propelled across the shallow waters and then dove. Suction cups held Mati\u2019s feet to the floor, but she fell face forward, landing on her hands. Tentacles wrapped around her wrists and torso and held her tight.\nInside the ship, the walls were somehow not the brilliant yellows and blues that appeared on the outside, but clear as glass. Water bubbled past and grew darker. The brightly colored crustaceans and shimmering fish that teemed in the shallows disappeared and were replaced by schools of large, dark, fish with predatory teeth.\nA loud crack as the lines broke off the other boat and her speed increased. They were much too deep for anything to have survived on the scavenger\u2019s ship. Either he had jumped off his own boat when they dove and was now stranded on the island with his partner or he drowned. Her body ached down to her bones from the shock he\u2019d given her and she couldn\u2019t muster up any guilt about his fate.\nThe music quieted. It was strange and beautiful. Mati loved music. It was the second thing she\u2019d fallen in love with after the sea. But for all her exploration of music from all over the galaxy, she\u2019d never heard anything exactly like this. The sound was subtle, but it poured into her ears and demanded she hear the unexpected complexity of sounds layered over sounds. Barely perceptible changes in tone and key making the music shift from joyful to melancholy.\nShe didn\u2019t know where the ship was taking her, but for the moment, she was safe and happy to enjoy the ride. She sprawled on the strange floor and took in the rich sea life and reveled in the glorious possibility of her find.\nA voice rose from the music. Deep and unearthly, it made her bones tremble and ache. The music crashed and swelled to an exhilarating crescendo, and the great metal tentacles that powered the ship flashed by in a powerful propulsive push. The ship went nose down and their dive steepened. Blood rushed into her head until her face felt swollen and black spots flashed across her vision.\nThe voice growled one last plaintive note and the music returned to its peaceful, ever-present hum. Mati took a deep breath as the ship levelled out.\nThe Octo ship continued its dive. Mati lost track of how long she\u2019d been on board. Long enough that the music was no longer gorgeous and her future no longer glowing. There was too much darkness and unchanging, empty water. And constant music. The notes dug deep into Mati\u2019s ears and took root in her brain. She wondered if the music was changing her somehow. Her dreams were vivid and strange, filled with people and places she\u2019d never seen. Great swells of purple water teeming with fish and octopuses who filled the air with twittering, singing conversation.\nShe rolled onto her side and caught sight of a spider web nestled in the corner. It must have smuggled itself in by hiding in her bag or clinging to her hair.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry little friend, but there are no bugs for you to eat here. Just fish. Frozen, dried, smoked, pickled, or raw. Fish for all tastes except for yours.\u201d\nThe spider did nothing. Just sat in his web, waiting for flies that would never come. Mati named him Bryn. Bryn didn\u2019t seem to notice the music and she envied him.\nShe forced herself to her feet to explore the ship. Maybe today she\u2019d find the button or control panel that was the key to control the ship. She believed that she searched once a day, but if Octos kept time deep under the ocean, she didn\u2019t know how. She felt as though she\u2019d been here for lifetimes, but perhaps it had only been a week.\nThe area she dubbed the bridge was a large round space that was at least five times taller than herself. There was nothing new to find. The walls were transparent, gently waving and squirming with not quite invisible tentacles and suction cups that would burst to the surface to catch her if she stumbled. Did the ship eat? Would it eventually tire of filling her brain with music and use its tentacles to suck her down and shove her into a gaping mouth hidden somewhere deep inside?\nOn all sides were a series of eight hallways that went inside the Octo ship\u2019s propulsive tentacles. The halls waved and lurched and led nowhere. Sometimes they seemed to have a mind of their own. One would pull in one direction while another pulled in another, and then all eight would synchronize again.\nShe stood at the very tip of one of the tentacles and watched as a massive shark swam up to the ship, rows of teeth jutting from its under-bite. It circled, unsure if the Octo ship was something it could eat, then tapped its pointed head against the hull and chomped down on a tentacle. Mati expected the ship to electrocute the shark or flick it away, but nothing happened. The shark bit down again. When the ship proved once more to be inedible, it swam off.\nMati thought about home. Her favorite records playing and Caryl giggling and glassy eyed from wine while they danced together in their tiny bedroom.\nIt had been a long time since she and Caryl had been that happy, but it was still there. Warmth. Happiness. Love. Home. She wanted to go home so badly that her chest felt swollen, as if her ribcage would crack open to spew loneliness. Tears burned her eyes and she hummed. A song she\u2019d been trying to write since she realized she was in love with Caryl seven years ago. She heard the song in her head, complicated and beautiful, but when she sat at her piano and tried to make the notes come out it was just a childish plinking.\nThe massive tentacle twitched and Mati stumbled. Suction cups popped from the floor to hold her as the tentacle swung about and began to push against the others. But the others were powerful and united and continued to pull them forward while the lone, traitorous tentacle continued to push futilely in the opposite direction.\nWas the ship starting to break down? No one knew why or how long before humans began to settle that the Octo\u2019s had left this part of the galaxy. But Octo tech didn\u2019t fail unless it was clumsily adapted. That was part of what made it so valuable.\nThe music changed. From the droning came a few soft notes as if plucked on a cello. They joined the sound and gave it a form that she recognized. It was her song.\nMati cried when Bryn died. She opened her eyes, suction cup marks on her cheek, her mouth tasting of fish, to see him: a pile of curled up legs, dead underneath the empty web he so carefully constructed. Bryn would never see land again and neither would she.\nShe dug through her pack until she found an empty box that had once held protein bars. She knelt in the corner and lifted Bryn\u2019s tiny body, being careful not to rip off one of his fragile legs, and slid him into the makeshift spider coffin.\nEven if it was oversized and covered in aggressively cheerful advertising, at least one of them would have a casket. She would be out of water soon. Her piss was already damn near fluorescent yellow and smelled toxic. The Octo ship provided water, but it was so salty that it did more harm than good and her purification kit was back on her rental boat.\nAnd still the goddamn music. Her simple plinking little song still played in the lone tentacle and echoed up through the bridge. Sometimes it sounded like a dirge and sometimes like a child\u2019s mocking rhyme.\nThe ship went silent and stalled.\nMati had grown so accustomed to the constant movement and music that the unmoving silence was nauseating. She stood and looked out to see what had caused the ship to stop.\nThe sea floor was a cemetery that teemed with the alien life that called the deepest parts of the ocean home. Misshapen, luminescent fish danced through great, hulking Octo ship carcasses. Broken metal tentacles had become home to lurking predators with empty eyes and massive teeth that lurched out and grabbed passing fish. Foot-long glowing worms squirmed across the bits of the ships that had been pulverized into shimmering, metallic sand.\nShe couldn\u2019t imagine what could have brought this destruction. Had there been an Octo war or a catastrophic natural disaster? Whatever happened, she was going to die staring at enough Octo tech for her and Caryl to buy their own planet.\nShe was going to die staring at the fabled Drowned City.\nThe ship shuddered. The music returned, but now it was a soft, slow, simple, melody. It swelled and stretched almost mournfully as if begging her: Look at what has become of us and grieve with me.\nThe Octo ship had brought her home. Just like she told it to, like she\u2019d begged, and screamed with rage until her throat bled. Take me home.\nIt was a terrible kind of awe to see the remains of Octo civilization laid out before her. It reminded her of the pictures of Pompeii she had seen in the history books as a child. But though the macabre sight made her heart ache for the ship and its society, she was still going to join these ship corpses if she couldn\u2019t make the ship understand what \u201chome\u201d meant to her.\nAn octopus, ghostly white with a fleshy pink underside pulled itself among the remnants of giant, more intelligent versions of itself. It pried apart a huge discarded shell and slid part of its body inside as if it were a portable roof. Its tentacles squirmed and pulled in different directions acting independently of each other.\nJust like the ship. That one tentacle that had changed direction and swam, uselessly, against the others.\nIt clicked into place. \u201cFuck. You\u2019re supposed to be smart, Mati.\u201d\nOf course, the Octo ship didn\u2019t function anything like a human ship. Whether the Octos evolved in the oceans alongside humans or somewhere far away, it didn\u2019t matter. They were truly and completely alien. There was no central brain. No master control panel. What she assumed was the bridge might as well be the sleeping quarters or the mess hall. Whatever controlled it was diffuse and the entire thing needed to know her goal. She had made one tentacle understand what she wanted, but not all of them.\nShe sat in the central part of the ship where she heard the music the loudest and sang until she was breathless. Loud enough for her voice to echo through every inch of the ship. Just as she had done when the tentacle changed direction, she thought of home. The musky smell of Caryl\u2019s hair after a long day of work and the way her freckled cheeks flushed when she laughed. She filled her nose with memories of salt and seaweed that wafted off the water and how for a few months their apartment smelled the way she imagined heaven must smell until the summer heat dried up the water and everything smelled of rotting fish.\nThe music hit a crescendo and changed. Her melody layered over soft droning tones that began to sound less alien and more like the musical version of her own memories. Deep wooden flutes mimicked air rushing through the cliffs that overlooked her home. A spray of chimes and the blast of something deep and brassy brought to mind lush green hills blanketed with mist and jarring percussion like the summer storms that rumbled and cracked loud enough to rattle the windows. The sounds wove together until she heard her song the way had always sounded in her head but she could never quite make real.\nThe ship pushed off the bottom and shot upwards. They went faster and faster and the great, booming voice joined her singing. It had shown her its grief and now it joined her in the joy she felt as her own home came closer and closer.\nThe ship came aground on the rocky sand half a galaxy away from where she had started her search. Rundown buildings jutted like ugly splinters from the hills. She imagined one of the lights was Caryl, waiting for her.\n\u201cOpen the door,\u201d she said.\nThe ship complied and brilliant, natural sunlight flooded inside. Mati stepped out into the shallow water, the still ground made her stumble and she fell face first. She sputtered and came up laughing. She lurched to the familiar rocks, gray and worn and dotted with barnacles. Somehow the ship had brought her home.\n\u201cThank you, thank you. Oh God, thank you.\u201d\nThe ship uncurled one tentacle and dropped a chunk of a dead Octo ship at her feet like a cat proudly bringing a dead bird to its owner. That hunk of dead tech wasn\u2019t nearly the find an intact, functional ship was. But she and Caryl could be comfortable. She could take that job with Gwyn and they could both work regular hours. Maybe even be happy. She didn\u2019t know if she believed that. Mati Kelly, walking away from the sea for a day job.\nOr she could sell the living ship. It would be dissected, cut to pieces, its organs harvested and used to produce phenomenally expensive, inferior versions of itself to be sold to businesspeople and trust fund kids.\nWas that why it offered her the corpse of one of its own? Did it know her intentions and hope to buy its own life?\nAll of her scrambling, searching, and fighting so she could walk away from the find of a lifetime. But even now, she heard its music. Playing over and over in her mind as if it had carved its notes into her brain. The Octo ship looked lost and sad in the shallows. However it travelled from world to world, its landing pads were the oceans. It didn\u2019t belong here on the shore.\nMati clambered back into the Octo ship to collect her backpack and Bryn\u2019s makeshift coffin which she placed with care on dry land.\nShe ran her hand across the brilliant hull. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t regret this. Go home. Your home.\u201d She pictured the ocean floor and hummed. The ship shuddered and lurched. It crawled and pulled itself deeper into the water and disappeared beneath the waves.\nShe hid the dead and broken Octo ship beneath branches blown from the tree covered hill, grabbed Bryn\u2019s coffin and her belongings, and began the trek home. As she walked, she heard the Octo ship\u2019s music echoing in her head. Maybe it would always be there.\nMati hummed along.\nLeigh Harlen is a queer and nonbinary writer whose work has been published in several magazines and anthologies including Aurealis, Shoreline of Infinity, and Dark Moon Digest.

Miran Anyuwe is not explaining policy. Miran Anyuwe is bleeding from a head wound, drops falling tap-tap-tap on the boarding ramp of our ship, the sound oddly amplified by the geometry of the cramped docking bay bulkheads.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a ride out,\u201d they say. They are not supposed to be on Idhir Station. They are supposed to be three jump points away, heading the accession talks, guiding Ohandar\u2019s joining of the Alliance.\nI uncross my legs and get up to my feet \u2013 one quick, practiced motion. I bow my head briefly. \u201cEsteemed, I will inquire.\u201d\nThey nod. Their smile intensifies just a little, as if someone repainted the lines of their mouth with firmer brushstrokes.\nI dash inside, my entire torso trembling with fear of the sudden and the unexpected. I take a sharp corner and crash into Master Sanre. They steady me with both hands.\n\u201cIryu, breathe.\u201d\nI gasp.\n\u201cSlower. In and out.\u201d\nTheir presence calms me. It only takes a few breaths.\n\u201cIryu, look at me.\u201d\nI stare up at them. Their eyes narrow, the lines of silver paint that I so carefully applied to their face in the morning crumple like spacetime clumps around a planet. The glass beads in their hair clack together.\n\u201cExplain what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nI mutter, still tongue-tied from the sudden fright. Miran Anyuwe is outside and injured. Miran Anyuwe wants to hire us. Miran Anyuwe\u2013\n\u201cWard the ship, then come outside. I will talk to them.\u201d\nThey hurry outside, boots clanging on metal.\nI exhale again. I focus on the power inside me, direct it outside and into the wards. My remaining tension eases up. I\u2019m not missing anything \u2013 I will be able to look at my master\u2019s sensory logs later. I turn around and return to the open airlock.\nI stop for a moment as I see the two of them together. They look so alike, and the resemblance goes beyond gender, appearance, the light brown of their skin and the dark brown of their braids. They have the same bearing, the same stance. It\u2019s clear both are used to effortless command. Miran Anyuwe commands an entire planet. My master commands only me and the ship.\nIs my master more powerful?\nIt\u2019s not about the head wound, it\u2019s not about the desperate urgency in Miran Anyuwe\u2019s gestures. It involves something innate that goes to the core of being.\nI knew my master was powerful. But did I overestimate Miran Anyuwe?\nBoth of them look up at me, nod at me to come closer. I approach, unsettled.\nMiran Anyuwe is unwilling to explain. Details are elided, skirted around. Anti-Alliance isolationists, terrorist threats, an attack on Miran Anyuwe\u2019s life. I don\u2019t understand why they abandoned the talks and went back to their planet \u2013 surely they knew they would present a better target there? Were they trying to pull off some populist maneuver? I find myself dismayed that my thoughts are moving along less than charitable pathways, but Miran Anyuwe clearly has something to hide.\nI tell myself it is only the bitterness of disillusionment. But did I really want them to be that glorified, polished figurehead from the political news, that semi-deity with a charmingly pacifist stance?\nI excuse myself; I start preparing for launch. My master can keep Miran Anyuwe company.\nThese ships do not run on pain; that\u2019s a misconception. They run on raw magical power. It can be produced in any number of ways. Pain is just easy for many people.\nOf course, it\u2019s a matter of choice. Even those who find it easy don\u2019t have to like it.\nI like it. I need it. If I go without, my body protests. Maybe it\u2019s about the need for overwhelming sensation; I\u2019m not sure.\nAs I\u2019m checking the equipment, I wonder why I\u2019m having these thoughts \u2013 I think because of a foreigner on the ship, a potential need to explain. For all the newscasts and analysis articles, I know little about Ohandar. The focus is always on Miran Anyuwe, and the progress of the negotiations. I wonder if that means the Ohandar isolationists have already won.\nI slow my all too rapid breathing. There will be time to get agitated later. First to get away from the gravity wells, to a relatively clean patch of spacetime while still on sublight. Then we can decide \u2013 the client can decide. Miran Anyuwe has all the reputation credit in the world to pay. Of course, my master would nix all the dangerous maneuvers. I just hope Miran Anyuwe isn\u2019t up to something wrong.\nI tug on straps, lean into them with my full bodyweight. They hold. They always hold, but it\u2019s best to check.\nI undress. A lot of magic leaves through my skin surface \u2013 I\u2019d rather not burn my clothing. I never have, but it heats up and that makes me worried. I\u2019ve already adjusted the ambient temp a few degrees higher, so I\u2019m not feeling cold.\nThe chamber is mostly empty \u2013 my master is a minimalist, and I like this: distractions do not help. The lines carved into the bulkheads \u2013 carefully, by hand \u2013 are the same off-white as the bulkheads themselves. One day it would be pleasant to have wood, but I like this surface too: it reminds me of ceramics, some of our tableware from down planetside.\nMaster Sanre is setting up the frame: pulling it out from storage inside the bulkheads, affixing it. They work quickly; we\u2019ve done this so many times.\nI say I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m eager to begin; we were stuck on Idhir Station for days upon days, our time consumed with administrative tasks. I\u2019m starved for a run, and we have the client of clients, safely ensconced in one of the bedchambers, but probably not yet asleep. Out on the corridor I felt their jitters, but this chamber is the best-warded on the ship. No distractions inside, no stray power leaking out and causing disturbance outside.\nI lie stomach down on a fixed-position pallet and my master straps me in. I wriggle a bit \u2013 everything seems to be in order. I smile up at them and they run a hand along the side of my face, smooth down my curls. I close my eyes for a moment and sigh a little. They chuckle.\n\u201cSo dreamy. What would you do without me?\u201d\n\u201cI would be sad?\u201d I volunteer, my voice thin and little.\nThey pat me on the shoulders.\nThey start with their bare hands, slapping, grabbing and pulling at the flesh. It is all quite gentle. I relax into the restraints and my muscles unknot. Whatever Miran Anyuwe is doing, I couldn\u2019t care less.\nHeavier thuds on the sides of my back. I can tell the implements by feel. I wish we would go faster \u2013 aren\u2019t we in a hurry?\nMaster Sanre fusses with the tool stand. They turn around, change stance. A whizzing sound through the air, a sharper pain. I yelp. Sound is good, it also helps release. We go on. On. My back burns. I groan at first, then scream. Tears and snot. I\u2013\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d\nMiran Anyuwe. How\u2013 The door was supposed to be locked\u2013\nDid you forget to lock the door? My master sends me a private message.\nIt locks automatically once the frame is disengaged, I think back over our connection. It should be encrypted, but now I am uncertain about everything.\nMiran Anyuwe strides up to us. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Their voice wavers with anger and fear. I try to crane my head to see \u2013 I can\u2019t, but Master Sanre disengages the straps with a quick thought-command. I sit up, trying to suppress the shaking caused by the sudden halt. I\u2019m not sure where to put all the magic. I clumsily wipe my face and hug myself. Why is Miran Anyuwe so angry?\nThey stare at each other. I wonder if I ought to say something.\nYou may speak, my master messages.\n\u201cPowering the ship,\u201d I say. My voice is wheezier, wavier than I\u2019d like. This voice is not for strangers. My vulnerability is not for strangers. Not even for Miran Anyuwe.\n\u201cYou did not say you would do that!\u201d\nDo what? I am baffled. \u201cPowering the ship?\u201d\nThey glare at Master Sanre. \u201cYou are hurting him!\u201d\n\u201cEm,\u201d my master says. \u201cDifferent pronouns.\u201d\nMiran Anyuwe looks startled; they know they of all people are not supposed to make assumptions. I feel they are gearing up to apologize, then thinking better of it. Some of their anger dissipates.\nThey hesitate \u2013 I\u2019ve never before seen them hesitate, then turn to me. \u201cIt will be all right,\u201d they say.\n\u201cCould you please leave?\u201d I am trying to be courteous, but the magic is pushing against my skin. This is not a point to come to a sudden stop. What is their problem?\n\u201cI am not letting them torture you,\u201d they say, with a sudden shift of tone into media-proof reassurance.\nI wish I could hit Miran Anyuwe. With so much magic, it is dangerous to even think of violence. I force down the thought. \u201cThey are not torturing me. Please.\u201d I wave my arms. My motions are increasingly jagged \u2013 I know I\u2019m losing control. \u201cI need to release the magic, please, could you please leave? It\u2019s dangerous. You shouldn\u2019t be in here.\u201d\n\u201cI would listen to em if I were you,\u201d my master says quietly. \u201cIf you\u2019re not leaving, I will escort you out.\u201d They step forward.\nMiran Anyuwe recoils. \u201cYou\u2013 you brute!\u201d They yell at my master. Then to me: \u201cI will protect you!\u201d\nThis would be annoying or even amusing if I weren\u2019t about to explode. I hug myself into a ball. I think I am making a sound\u2026?\nI don\u2019t see how my master grabs them and drags them physically out of the room. I can hear their huffs as they manually turn the lock.\nHurried steps across the room. My master is practically flying. Toward me.\nArms around me. I feel very small. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d Holding me tight. \u201cYou can let it go now. I will guide it. You can let it go.\u201d\nI howl, convulsing, weeping. The magic tears at my insides as it rushes out. My master will have things to repair \u2013 I am suddenly angry at Miran Anyuwe for this, but then the thought is swept away; thought itself is swept away.\nOutside, the ship is moving.\nMy master is so furious they have excess. They run up and down the length of the room, then just groan and push magic into the structure.\n\u201cNext time I\u2019ll have to do that out the airlock or I\u2019ll just fry the controls,\u201d they say. Calm enough to sound cynical. They shake their head. Clack, clack. \u201cI\u2019ll fix you up once I\u2019m steadier,\u201d they say. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to leave lasting damage. I would\u2019ve torn them in half!\u201d\nI seldom hear my master talk about violence. But I understand the source of their fury now.\nI query the systems. Where is Miran Anyuwe? Pacing the corridor outside, apparently.\nI close my eyes and lay back. I don\u2019t think I can face the client. I don\u2019t think I can face anything. How could things go this wrong?\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d my master says. \u201cYou can rest. I\u2019ll bring you your heavy blanket.\u201d\nThey cover me up. I wriggle into the warm, weighty duvet, grab armfuls of it. Some things are eternal, unchanging. My master briefly caresses my head, fingers playing with my short curls. My muscles loosen up. I can feel that some of the tension leaves my master, too. I turn my head, peek out from the blanket to gaze at them. They look like Miran Anyuwe; but they also look like me, and this time I just want to focus on the latter. People have mistaken us for relatives before, and there is something deeply comforting in this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d they say. \u201cNone of this is your fault.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 the door?\u201d I find it hard to move my lips and tongue. My mouth doesn\u2019t work.\n\u201cThere was a malfunction.\u201d They frown. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that Miran Anyuwe is a magical person, too, if not so powerful as either of us.\u201d\nThe message, unspoken: Be on your guard.\nI\u2019m back in our room, still resting, the soft upper layer of our mattress bending obediently around my aching flesh. Master Sanre repaired what could be repaired right away, then set the rest on a healing course. I\u2019m halfway to sleep, drifting in a white-fluffy haze, when the alarm sounds.\nI get out of bed, hastily dress, walk to the control room like a baby duck unsteady on its legs. Teeter-totter. My master looks up at me, and so does Miran Anyuwe. I feel they had been arguing.\n\u201cWarships on our tail,\u201d says Master Sanre. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to jump soon, and hope fervently that they can\u2019t follow us.\u201d\nWe\u2019re still on sublight, and moving much slower than our target velocity due to the unwelcome interruption. I grimace, try to gather my wits. The warships must be after Miran Anyuwe; we ourselves don\u2019t have enemies.\nI sense my master\u2019s gaze upon me. \u201cHow soon can we jump?\u201d they ask.\n\u201cI can start preparing right away,\u201d I say. I know the healing won\u2019t be able to run its course, and I know that\u2019s also what my master has been thinking. But if we are hit by a mass-driver, there won\u2019t be any healing in the world to repair our bodies.\nMiran Anyuwe has stopped protesting. I want to grab them, snarl at them: If you think what you saw was bad, just see what happens now. Just watch. Will you turn your head away?\nA shot whips past our ship: the sensors tell me everything in minute detail. I shudder.\nMaster Sanre tries to hail the warships. No response, just another shot. Deliberately missing? Intended as a warning?\nThen a third, aimed head on\u2013\nMy master jumps up from their chair. \u201cWe need to get out now!\u201d\nThey tackle me, hug me to themselves, push me down on the floor. My face flattens against the cold floorboards, my mouth opens. I gasp for breath.\n\u201cNow!\u201d they yell, and even without the familiar trappings, my body responds instantaneously, my mind rushes through the preparations of matter transposition.\nMagic rises in me, floods me, streams outward, suffuses the ship. I scream with the sudden expansion of awareness, the pain of white-hot power running along my spine, I keen and convulse as my master holds me down, grabs hold of my power to direct it outward\u2013\n\u2013we jump. Arriving clumsily at our target destination, off the ecliptic, too close to the system\u2019s star. I cough, close my eyes to better focus on the sensors. I try not to focus on my body. Something feels broken, not a bone or two but a process itself; something biochemical knocked askew.\nMaster Sanre rolls to the side, still holding me close. We remain there for a few breaths, ignoring Miran Anyuwe. We get up, holding onto each other.\n\u201cWe need to jump into Alliance space,\u201d my master says, \u201cwho knows how fast they can follow us?\u201d\nVery few people can make an entire ship jump as rapidly as I do; my magic simply has an uncommon shape that\u2019s well-suited for this particular task. Miran Anyuwe doesn\u2019t know this. Our pursuers don\u2019t know this.\n\u201cI\u2019ll request a permit right away,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it. You get ready to jump again.\u201d\nMy master is still trying to get through to an Alliance comm station when the warships show up. I can\u2019t even make it to the power chamber. Pain unfurls, spreads out as I raise power; I flail and claw against my master who holds me strongly. The ship jumps.\nI\u2019m half dragged, half carried. Two voices wheezing. My master and\u2026 Miran Anyuwe?\nThey drop me down on the pallet, and the shape, the sensation identifies it to me. I\u2019m in the power chamber. Straps are pulled, tightened across my body.\n\u201cCan you do it? Can you do it again?\u201d\nIt takes time to realize my master is speaking to me. I nod, teeth gritted.\n\u201cCan you do it?\u201d Miran Anyuwe asks them.\n\u201cOh\u2013\u201d My master suppresses a curse. \u201cDon\u2019t bother about me!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I am\u2013\u201d They raise their voice and it trembles. Suddenly I am worried: I need to bring this to a close, I can take the magic, but what about my master?\nI grapple with words for a few moments before I am able to speak. \u201cI can jump us to Alliance space without a beacon.\u201d\n\u201cWithout a permit? It\u2019s illegal,\u201d my master protests, but inwardly I know they are already convinced. The Alliance goons ask first, shoot second, not the other way round like the jockeys of these warships are wont to do.\n\u201cI\u2019d take Alliance Treaty Enforcement over these people any day,\u201d I say, knowing full well that they have magic-users just like me. I used to be one of them. I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of harm\u2019s way fast enough. More effort and I won\u2019t be able to do anything at all, but one more jump I can manage, even against the gradient, against the odds\u2013\nThe warships are back.\nI strain against the straps and clutch at my master, scream at them to pull, pull because I can\u2019t generate enough power in time, and after their initial hesitation they do it, and I can feel myself pulled apart, space itself getting fragmented and torn, unraveling at the edges\u2013\nWe are in orbit around Andawa, second-tier Alliance population center. We know this planet well. It\u2019s easy for us to jump here.\nIt will take the Alliance more than a moment to mobilize their forces. Andawa is peripheral, but not so peripheral as to be without protection. The enforcers will simply take a bit longer to arrive, jumping in probably from Central.\nMy master undoes the straps, their fingers working as their mind is busy hailing Planetside Control. I try to stand, fall into their arms. Miran Anyuwe is silent this time, but I can tell they are shaking, and not just with the side-effects of back-to-back jumps with no jump point, no beacon.\nI make a motion toward them, then slowly collapse and fold into myself as my legs give way. My master topples down on the floor together with me, cradles my head.\nThe warships soon follow. I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t jump. I can\u2019t think. I gasp and wheeze, try to push myself upright. My master pushes me back. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d they whisper next to my ear.\nThe enemies can\u2019t quite jump into our ship \u2013 the wards still hold. They board the old-fashioned way, with lots of clanging and metal being cut. Where is the Alliance? Why are they so slow?\nBefore my vision gives in, I see black-clad commandos stream into the room. I see Miran Anyuwe crouch on the floor next to me, taking cover behind the box of equipment.\nI don\u2019t understand what the commandos are saying. I only understand what my master is thinking.\nOn their signal, I roll to the side, bump into Miran Anyuwe, my arms around them. They smell of marzipan. I hold fast. Then I fall through space, through time, through awareness itself.\nSharp, prickly grass. The sunlight scrapes at the back of my head when I open my eyes; I close them and shiver despite the warmth of Andawa\u2019s sun. I grapple with the earth as I try to get if not upright, then at least on all fours. I can\u2019t even pull myself up on my elbows \u2013 I lose balance, smear my face and arms with rich dark dirt. Andawa is a garden world.\nMiran Anyuwe is speaking, has been speaking for a while now. I can\u2019t make sense of the words. They reach under my armpits and pull.\nGaps in continuity.\nMiran Anyuwe dragging me on some backcountry path and yelling at me, preaching that I shouldn\u2019t live a life of slavery. I try to say that I am not a slave, I serve my master voluntarily, without coercion. My speech turns into mush \u2013 my mouth is too uncoordinated \u2013 and in any case Miran Anyuwe refuses to listen. I can\u2019t walk unassisted, I can barely parse sentences and yet they are preaching to me, about how I ought not to be running away from freedom but toward it.\nWho\u2019s running away, I want to say, but my systems checks are failing one by one, my biosensors are screaming.\nWords. Words. More words. Completely opaque.\nI\u2019m lying on the slightly curving floor \u2013 a ship\u2019s bay? Entirely unfamiliar beyond the reassuring calmness of Alliance-standard. Miran Anyuwe is sitting next to me, their left hand on my forehead. I try to bat it aside; my entire right side spasms. I gasp, force steadiness on my breath, ignore all the warnings.\nMiran Anyuwe speaks \u2013 the sentences elude me. I want to turn and see, observe the crowd whose presences I can feel pressing on my mind, but I can\u2019t move; even my motions to shoo away Miran Anyuwe are little more than twitches.\nSomeone, a sharp bright voice, finally: \u201c\u2026a medical emergency, Captain, we need to intervene.\u201d I miss the answer. Then the same person, slower, pausing after each word: \u201cCaptain, you need to allow me.\u201d\nMiran Anyuwe withdraws; I sigh in relief. Someone crouches down next to me and oh I know this mind-template, so familiar I fight the urge to grab and latch onto it, in this sea of incomprehension where in every moment an eddy or whirl can cause me to drift away. Ereni magic-user, delegated to the Alliance; they don\u2019t call it magic, they have their own words\u2026\n\u201cSsh.\u201d A touch on my chest. \u201cYou are almost completely drained. I will help you if you let me.\u201d\nI murmur something, hoping it will be enough, hoping the intent would be clear. I reach to the Ereni\u2019s hand on my chest, but my fingers fail to connect. I\u2019m not quite clear about where my body parts are situated at any given moment.\nWarm egg-yolk-yellow power floods into me through their hand and my cells drink it in, desperate for nourishment. I can move. I can live.\nSpeaking doesn\u2019t come as fast. Where is my master, I think at the Ereni now that my thoughts can move forward, Is my master safe?\nETA another twenty-five minutes, the Ereni thinks in my head. We are short on people to jump them here. The Isolationists have been apprehended and are being ejected from Alliance space. I look up at the Ereni \u2013 their appearance matches my mental impression of them. Black, thick-set, gender-indeterminate. They are still clenching their jaw. I know it takes a lot of effort to get exact numbers across \u2013 this is not a high-magic area. I nod, appreciating the effort. They hold my hand, squeeze it. Just as I understand them, they also understand me, through the shared demands of magic and the hierarchies it often creates.\nI sigh, look around. Across the room, a short, sharp-featured officer in the uniform of Alliance Treaty Enforcement glares at \u2013 me? No, at Miran Anyuwe. My interface works again, the error messages recede. The officer is a man, by the name of Adhus-Barin, with about half a dozen more lineage-names after his first. A nobleman from the Empire of Three Stars, one of the more socially conservative members of the Alliance.\n\u201cMaybe we can try this again,\u201d Adhus-Barin says. He looks about as angry as a noble in a mere Alliance captaincy position can be expected to look, his auburn-brown skin darkening further. His systems are probably frantic, trying to avoid a stroke. \u201cYou might wish to rephrase what you\u2019ve just told me.\u201d\nMiran Anyuwe seems proud as ever, but as my body processes the influx of magic, I can already tell the politician radiates fear, apprehension and\u2026 brokenness, somehow. An impression of someone caught in the act.\n\u201cI was escaping from the Isolationists who were after me,\u201d Miran Anyuwe says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made it to Alliance space if not for these excellent people.\u201d They nod at me. Am I supposed to smile, murmur thanks? I remain silent. They continue: \u201cOne of whom doesn\u2019t even understand the Code of Life and Balance, I must say.\u201d\nWhat is that? If I hear one more word about how I\u2019m supposed to be some kind of slavery apologist\u2026\nAdhus-Barin also glares at them. Is he waiting for Miran Anyuwe to incriminate themselves?\nThe politician continues, shifting pace as if realizing they are no longer talking to their home crowd. \u201cAs you are no doubt aware, the Isolationists oppose our negotiations to join the Alliance, negotiations that I am leading\u2026\u201d They pause, uncertain for a moment. \u201cBetween two rounds of talks, I returned to Ohandar, where I was summarily attacked, and after my attempted escape, even my security detail deserted me at Idhir Station, so I had to seek out a private vessel for help\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour security detail betrayed you?\u201d Adhus-Barin turns oddly mild, almost gentle. I don\u2019t have to pry into his thoughts to sense a trap being readied.\n\u201cThey were all Isolationists, they turned against me\u2013\u201d Voice rising. Miran Anyuwe is losing their cool.\n\u201cOh, those kinds of roughshod mercenaries don\u2019t appreciate going unpaid,\u201d Adhus-Barin nods with empathy.\n\u201cWhat could I have done? The talks were almost over and the funds\u2013\u201d They halt midsentence.\nI stare. At Adhus-Barin smiling, his thin mouth turning up in almost a sneer, at Miran Anyuwe standing statue-still, with only stray tremors breaking through their rigidity.\nThe security detail going unpaid. Isolationists going unpaid.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Adhus-Barin says, \u201cI do believe this will be enough.\u201d\nAs if a dam breaking through, Miran Anyuwe starts blabbering, words tumbling over each other. The statue falling apart. \u201cThe Alliance has to understand, the Alliance knows \u2013 isolationist sentiment has always been strong on Ohandar, we had to show the populace that isolationism was extremism, we had to\u2013\u201d\n\u201cSo you backed the Isolationist movement, steered them into violence,\u201d Adhus-Barin says, one step away from gloating. \u201cCreated and funded your own rivals, so that you could point a finger at them and say, we are not like those people. So that you could revel in the position of the peacemaker.\u201d\n\u201cThe Alliance knows! Don\u2019t deny it! The Alliance knows!\u201d\n\u201cMay I?\u201d the Ereni says, then waits for the captain\u2019s nod. \u201cThe Alliance knows. That doesn\u2019t mean the Alliance assents.\u201d\n\u201cExactly as Officer Enis\u0101yun has it,\u201d the captain nods at them again. \u201cUndesirable allies often incriminate themselves during the accession process, as we have found.\u201d He says it as if the Empire was innocent of all possible wrongdoing, and I wonder if Miran Anyuwe knows how the Alliance had taken its present shape, what had prompted the member states to create Treaty Enforcement, back it with real power and threat. I sneak a look at Enis\u0101yun, and the Ereni glances back at me, shrugs.\nMiran Anyuwe mutters word-fragments, all sense lost in overwhelming anger, directed at us who thwarted the plan. We all gaze upon the spectacle. I pull my personal wards tighter around myself in case Miran Anyuwe lashes out.\nOfficer Enis\u0101yun asks to speak again, then gestures toward me. \u201cThe esteemed leader might wish to thank the young m\u0101wal\u0113ni here for saving their life.\u201d\nAdhus-Barin makes a face. The meaning is clear \u2013 he would rather the politician would have perished, murdered by their own erstwhile allies. Let alone called esteemed leader, but then again the Ereni are fond of formality\u2026 and its ironic flipside.\nEnis\u0101yun smiles softly. \u201cWe will make sure that the young m\u0101wal\u0113ni receives all due payment for services rendered \u2013 though from whom might be uncertain at this point\u2026\u201d\nMiran Anyuwe collapses.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Enis\u0101yun says, voice shaky. \u201cCaptain? It wasn\u2019t me, Captain.\u201d\n\u201cI thought they were warded from all outside\u2013\u201d A voice from the back of the Alliance crowd, then another, \u201cI warded them!\u201d\nA door seal hisses, and my master dashes in, the familiar clang of boots on ship-metal. \u201cWere they threatening anyone? I felt they might be threatening someone, so it seemed safer to shut them down.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Adhus-Barin seems utterly lost. It\u2019s that kind of day, the Ereni thinks at me and I suppress a chuckle.\n\u201cI have a policy of not interfering with clients\u2019 minds, but they severely disrupted my ship, interrupted the jumping procedure\u2013\u201d\nOfficer Enis\u0101yun is shocked in the back of my mind.\n\u201c\u2013so I thought it would be safest to plant my safeguards on them just in case. They had no defenses to speak of.\u201d\nAn understatement, recognized by everyone present as such. When did my master have time to do this? I consider the events of the day, fail to find the exact moment. An intervention performed off-hand, with a stray thought\u2026\nAs Adhus-Barin regains his calm and goes through the motions of the cleanup, organizing transport for Miran Anyuwe to Alliance Central where they will no doubt have to endure another round of castigation before getting booted out of Alliance space, my attention is elsewhere. I knew my master was more powerful, I tell myself, but I understand at the same time that it\u2019s not about power \u2013 or, rather, that power entails more than raw control. It entails being straightforward, honest, upright.\nAnd I know that between the two of us, we don\u2019t need a planet.\nMaster Sanre offers me a hand and I stand up \u2013 then they grab me, hold me tight to themselves, their tears trickling down my curls.\nBogi Tak\u00e1cs is a neutrally gendered Hungarian Jewish author currently living in the United States.

But a slippery one. Time moves differently there. Start here: you have never seen him before but you recognize him immediately.\nThe garden is made of ice, as gardens are. She was looking for the attic, but she must have made a wrong turn somewhere. The sun is setting. Peach-colored light sparkles through the trees; translucent rosebushes drip onto the path.\nHer feet are bare and she walks through icy puddles, but she\u2019s not really walking, just sliding her feet back and forth in place. She draws a green towel around her shoulders for warmth and reaches out to touch one of the roses. They aren\u2019t ice; they\u2019re gold. Everything is gold, even the sky, which is silver.\nWhat is this place? She\u2019s standing on a flat gold circle that reflects her legs as dark smears. There\u2019s no one here but her and the cats. They hum fragments of a haunting melody that sounds like the first few bars of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\nHe comes through a doorway that was always there and scoops up a fluffy white Persian just before its claws make contact with the side of a sofa. He must be the keeper of the cats. When she looks at the floor, she sees that only one of his legs is reflected. The other is represented by a giant fork. That explains why he moves by hopping.\nExcuse me, she says. He looks up at her, startled. Their eyes meet. She\u2019s never seen him before, but she likes the way his hair falls over his forehead. I would have expected more mushrooms, she says, and when he laughs at her cleverness she likes the astonished shape of his smile, the way his eyes crinkle. She\u2019s about to ask him something but just then all the cats start buzzing and\nYou put your feet on the wood floor and squint disapprovingly at the sun. Rub your eyes as you stumble into the bathroom. The details already dissolving.\nI\u2019m floating high above a wide, featureless plain of burnt orange. I think it might be fire. The wind billows my skirt out around my legs. I stare down at the fabric. Green patchwork squares with sheep on them. The sheep graze peacefully.\nA bird floats beside me. I hear the whining of its motors as it hovers. As I turn my head I see it\u2019s actually a rubber duck\u2014soft, bright-yellow plastic, red grinning mouth, painted black ovals for eyes. I don\u2019t like the way it looks at me.\nI can see them far below me. Him and me. The tops of our heads. One with light brown hair, short, one with dark brown hair, long, pulled back in a ponytail. We\u2019re having tea in the middle of the desert, on a table with a checkered top. Our plates are giant checkers, mine red, his black. There are sandwiches on the plates, cut into triangles. I can tell from here that the sandwiches are tuna. We lean closer together and our foreheads\nHis skin touches my skin and I feel heat radiating between us. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck together, like our brains are black holes sucking each other in\u2014no, not black. Red, maybe. Or gold. Autumn leaf colors. Something warm. I feel the strands of his hair pressed between my skin and his, oddly thick and brittle, like spaghetti.\nHe\u2019s whispering to me but the words flow out of my head as soon as I hear them. All I catch is that it\u2019s very important not to eat the sandwiches. I pick up my teacup and see that it\u2019s a giant pretzel. We each take hold of one thick, salt-crusted loop and pull, and suddenly I understand\nShe\u2019s standing on a mountaintop, wind whirling scraps of leaves around her, looking down into a valley. She\u2019s vaguely aware that the duck\u2014no, it\u2019s a raven\u2014is still hovering in the sky above her left shoulder. The land lies in folds of purple and green, like a quilt, with stitches holding them together.\nDown below her a procession of riders on horseback is threading its way through the valley. Jewels glint in their hair. The horses\u2019 hooves sound like typewriter keys. Hounds are baying, but they\u2019re very far away; no need to worry about that yet.\nShe\u2019s on a man-made balcony, bare wooden planks, a floor cut into the mountain, a railing all around her so she doesn\u2019t fall. She leaps, rather, gracefully into the air, like a ballerina, or a diver. She floats down as softly as a dandelion seed, but she can\u2019t quite touch the ground. She points her toes, but her feet still don\u2019t reach. It makes it difficult to get anywhere. She bobs and drifts away.\nYou\u2019ve had that one before. Or something like it. You don\u2019t know why it unnerves you so much. If you ate the sandwiches you would have to stay forever, isn\u2019t that\u2026?\nIt\u2019s a gray, drizzly evening when she sees him again. He\u2019s standing on a street corner, begging for coins. A musician. But instead of an instrument he has a steel box with a crank on the side. It\u2019s called a hurdle girdle. She walks straight by him, because she\u2019s in a hurry (she has important envelopes to deliver) but then she stops and turns back.\nShe recognizes him; she\u2019s sure of it. It\u2019s only his face that\u2019s different. His eyes are dark brown. His nose is straighter, larger, his hair blowing in gold wisps over his forehead. Candy wrappers fly by, flapping their wings. She drops a coin into the cup by his feet. It\u2019s not really a cup; it\u2019s an ear. A ceramic ear, pink-glazed, oversized, rooted deep in the earth.\nShe bends politely to look into the box and turns the crank. A green velvet cape falls over her shoulders. Inside she sees black and white photos. A camel. A rose. A woman\u2019s face, heavily lipsticked, frowning at her. Her mouth is a shiny black line like a leech, and she wears a black top hat. She\u2019s a woman of great power and not to be trifled with; she sets everything on fire by clicking her fingernails together\nSomething about a camel? Something important. I\u2019m late for work. I try to put on my clothes, but my closet is full of things I didn\u2019t buy, a leopard print bikini, a poncho with neon green fringe. I try to put on my clothes, but my hands move so slowly that I can\u2019t seem to I try to put on my\nYou know it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s just that it feels so real. A place where all the rules are different, a place you aren\u2019t equipped to understand. A thousand years could pass in one night under the hill. How do you get there from here?\nTime moves differently there. He told her so. Start here: he\u2019s the one. She knows it by the pink flush on the backs of her hands. He\u2019s a waiter at the restaurant, dressed in a crisp white uniform with gold buttons. The d\u00e9cor is elegant, the floor black and white tile. He leans against the wall to take the weight off his bad leg. It was broken once, he said.\nShe gets up out of her booth and tries to go to him, to speak to him, but another waiter\u2019s standing in the way. He\u2019s gray-eyed and pale, bored-looking, and he won\u2019t stop talking. He\u2019s her eleventh grade history teacher. That explains it. She tries to push past Mr. Donaldson but he won\u2019t budge. Finally she crawls between his legs.\nThen she\u2019s sitting in a booth with the other waiter, her waiter, who has his leg propped up and is rubbing it. Vines are twining around his knee, the thorns digging into his skin. But he\u2019s happy to see her. Write this down, he says, and he hands her a piece of onion skin with an address written on it in free verse. His handwriting is neat, spidery cursive. She chews it up and swallows it down with a gulp of wine.\nI\u2019m in an airplane, flying over the jungle, only there isn\u2019t actually an airplane. A black standard poodle is the pilot. I stumble through the aisles and bump hard against someone\u2019s chest. I clutch handfuls of red and orange plaid shirt. I\u2019m sorry, I say, and look up, and that\u2019s when I realize it\u2019s him again. His face breaks into a joyful smile as he realizes it, too. We thought we were out of time.\nWe kiss. For the first time? It\u2019s oddly soft and mushy, like pieces of him might come off in my mouth, but I don\u2019t the plane is going down, down onto the spiked railings below and crows fly up in a cloud and I\u2019m\nI wake up screaming with bats flying out of my mouth. One of them is stuck in my throat, and I can\u2019t swallow it or spit it out. I try to stick a fork down my throat to pry it loose but I accidentally break off one of my teeth instead. It lies in my palm, cracked and bloody. The rest of my teeth are loose, too, and I have to pull them out one by one. I pick one up and uncap it. It\u2019s lipstick. Dark red, almost black. I smear it on my mouth.\nYou start a journal to keep track of them. A lot gets lost in translation. You do research online, check out books from the library. The meaning of fish, or nakedness, or water. The symbolism never seems to line up right. You think you understand it better than they do.\nYou always wake up so tired these days.\nHe sits down at the table across from her. A bowl of cherries is between them. Flies keep landing on the cherries. Has she been here before? His face is thinner than it should be. His hair is thinning. Tufts of it fall onto the tablecloth, like clumps of dust, like mice. Some of the mice crawl away very slowly, dragging injured legs.\nLook at me, he says. It\u2019s very important. It\u2019s all right, she reassures him; she already knows not to eat the cherries. He tries to say something else but it all fuzzes out into static; she knows there are words but she can\u2019t pay attention to them.\nA horn sounds and he starts and turns, wide-eyed. No one told her this was a forest. The full moon is above them, impossibly large and yellowed. Red poker chips carpet the ground. A white deer with gold horns is running. Hoof beats. A woman whose black hair flaps as she rides. There aren\u2019t any other horses so she tries to follow on foot but she trips over\nSometimes she sees through his eyes. His leg hurts, so he has to use a kitchen chair as a cane. It clunks heavily against the ground. The line runs halfway around the block, and he can see the back of her head partly hidden by the gray sweatshirt of the man behind her, her dark ponytail hanging down, a hint of green shirt collar. Far in the distance the marquee says, Never But Also. It wavers in the heat.\nFinally he catches up to her. He\u2019s sweating. She turns, folding a playbill in her hands. He tries to tell her where he is. They\u2019re running out of time. Her face is greasy and puzzled. It\u2019s raining grease and little morsels of fried chicken and she\nYou stare at the sunlit ceiling. He told you something. You know this. But all you remember is the number 18. Or was\nit\u2014? If only you could make sense of it while you\u2019re there. Control it somehow. People do manage it sometimes. Just say, theoretically, that it mattered to someone who wasn\u2019t you.\nWhat is this place? The air is full of soap bubbles, thick-skinned and resilient. I should try. It always slips my mind. I hold my breath and push my way inside a bubble and there he is, sitting on a porch swing with gold gargoyles on the arms. I reach out to touch his shoulder but when he turns to me he has no mouth. His eyes are missing. His hands are trees.\nI\u2019m in a room made of glass and a hurricane is coming. I look around for something to use as a weapon. Iron. He told me she doesn\u2019t like iron, or was it rutabagas? The door is green, but I can\u2019t get out that way. There are three tigers in the room, crawling around the ceiling and shedding fur everywhere.\nI keep watching the door. I\u2019m waiting for someone. There are black-slatted blinds on all the windows, and I run around pulling them down because that will protect me. I lift a strawberry from the countertop and put it into my mouth but before I can bite down it shatters into a million pieces and someone is on the other side of the door calling to me but I can\u2019t hear it over the roar of the wind. Water slams against the glass and the noise\nYour sheets are soaked in sweat. You don\u2019t remember but you think something bad almost happened. You need to do more research. You wish you could bring it with you. They can\u2019t, for example, cross running water; you could use that. If you spill sugar they have to count the grains. You probably have more time to plan than he does.\nJust say, theoretically. How would it even work? Assuming it were possible. Would he be here in the apartment when you got back? No, not likely. Maybe he\u2019s in a hospital somewhere, hooked up to machines. Maybe you\u2019d pass each other on the street one day and both have to stop and say, I\u2019m sorry, you just seem so familiar. Maybe you\u2019d never speak of it. Maybe it would be a secret between you all your life together.\nTonight will be different. She watches him dance, twirling across the ballroom floor on puppet strings, his arms hanging limply, held up by the elbows. The floor is made of grass, but the grass looks just like marble. Crickets chirp in the cracks between the tiles. A woman in a long black dress is spinning with him is spinning him has put her hands on his face and pulls him down to kiss her. Ink trickles down his face.\nShe knows she can\u2019t let anyone see her, so she hides behind the elephant that\u2019s waiting to take her to school, and she didn\u2019t even study for the midterm. How could she forget to study? She\u2019s always so but didn\u2019t she graduate already? She\u2019s almost sure. Forty percent. She almost wonders if she\u2019s somewhere she\u2019s not supposed to be.\nShe knows without having to be told that there\u2019s no sun here. The sun is gone. A bear ate it. She likes bears. They\u2019re so warm. There\u2019s one on her back right now.\nI find him again soon after, or maybe it isn\u2019t soon. He\u2019s one of the crowd watching the bicycle show. The bicycles cavort while the audience claps politely. His head pokes up above a woman\u2019s gray fedora.\nI hurry to his side, my socks making a pleasant gurgling noise against the carpet, and take his hand. It\u2019s warm, familiar, a connection humming between the two of us. I smile and look up at him and when did he get so tall? He\u2019s almost comically tall, stretched out too thin. He wears a long gray overcoat. His face is different, as usual, eyes too wide-set, too small, gray instead of brown. He\u2019s almost ugly. He blinks down at me. I\u2019m sorry, he says, do I know you?\nSomething is missing behind his eyes. It isn\u2019t him; it\u2019s just a decoy. His other arm rests on the shoulder of the woman with the fedora. She has a foxy face, long teeth. She keeps her eyes focused on the dancing goats, grinning with amusement. The feather in her hat bobs in the wind. I reach up to his face and try to fix it. If I could just push the eyes closer together, make the nose sharper. His flesh morphs easily, rubbery and fluid, but I can\u2019t get it right. Where is he really? He could be anywhere. He could be in the grass under my\nHe can hear her footsteps somewhere near him, but he can\u2019t move. Someone has tried to cut out his heart. A little door of skin stands open in his chest and gold light comes from inside it. He\u2019s lying on concrete, bleeding. He knows he\u2019s bleeding but he can\u2019t feel it. Music is playing somewhere above him. A waltz. She won\u2019t come, will she. He would have liked to tell her\nShe sees him right away, but the train station is so large and the crowd so dense. Red balloons bob against the rafters. She has to get to him. She takes a running jump and slams into the wall that was always there. It\u2019s covered with blobs of gray stucco.\nShe needs to get through the wall somehow. She pushes against it with her palms but nothing happens. She steps back and pretends it\u2019s not a wall. This time when she leans into it, it dissolves around her and she falls through. He\u2019s kneeling there in front of her. A black snake is wrapped around his neck as a scarf. She says, very purposefully, I love you.\nA wind blows and dust obscures her vision and she\u2019s all out of bus tokens, but maybe they\u2019ll accept this toad? It\u2019s always been very reliable. She takes a step up into the no. This isn\u2019t. Something gold. She has to get\nRestaurant. White tile. Rabbits. Wait, but isn\u2019t? Been here before. Something is hanging from the ceiling, wrapped up in leather like a bat\u2019s wings. It blinks at her in Morse code.\nThe attic. Only a candle to light my way. The warmth of my hand shielding it. Flickering walls. The floor won\u2019t stay still. He could be under my. I have to be careful not to cast any shadows because the shadows are really. Something is curled up in a dusty corner with coils of wire wrapped around it. Or maybe they\u2019re vines. It rocks back and forth. Dark is spreading up the ceiling over my head. I turn around and\nDesert. His nails dig into my palm. He tries to get up but his leg is caught in a giant mousetrap, his eyes are squeezed shut. His free hand makes five parallel tracks in the sand. I try to kiss him but my mouth won\u2019t open; it\u2019s full of glue. Why did I eat glue? Mistake. The desert is on fire. Fire is marching up my feet, my calves. It marches to a drumbeat that was always there. The sky is filling up with smoke and the fire blooms all over me, hotter than anything I could possibly imagine and my skin is charring and peeling off in sheets of blackened paper with writing all over them, the ends of my hair spurt fountains of ash and I open my hand. I open it. Mistake. He slips free. He tries to grab for me but his fingers melt in the heat and drip onto the ground in a puddle of gold. His eyes lock with mine and his mouth forms a word I can\u2019t hear and then I\u2019m alone with my hands full of eggshells.\nShe finds him standing by the blue SUV under the willow tree. He\u2019s crying. He\u2019s much shorter now. His skin is coming off in patches. Underneath is something black and slick and shiny. She peels the skin off his cheek and puts it in her mouth. It crackles and dissolves. I\u2019m sorry, he says, trying to straighten the line of his mouth, I can\u2019t\nIt\u2019s all right, she says and puts her arms around him, rests her head on his chest, feels the watch parts beating inside, click, clock, cluck\nThis time you\u2019ll remember. You\u2019ll remind yourself before you close your eyes. You\u2019ll repeat it fifty times if you have to. This time you\u2019ll get it right. You don\u2019t know why you keep\nI\u2019m lying in bed. Waves are rolling around me, rocking the boat. It\u2019s cold. I feel a hand clasping mine, fingers intertwining, but no one is there. I can\u2019t see him but it doesn\u2019t bother\nWhere did all this water come from? I wonder if I will drown but I don\u2019t\nSalt water fills my mouth like blood and I wake up gasping. I wake up. I wake up.\nYou\u2019ll remember this much later, as you squeeze lemon-scented soap onto a dishrag in your apartment that smells like things frying. You\u2019ll sink your hands into the water and suddenly feel too hot, go to pry open the window and stare down into the alley where a plastic bag blows fitfully.

The steel dragonfly crouched low on the back of the chair, its eyes two half-domes of mother-of-pearl, and its teardrop wings flicked and hummed even as its feet clasped its perch tightly, made restless by geas. Ignoring a messenger was petty, but Mei concentrated on daubing the last chain with her bone-tipped pen, and shook the globe gently until it glowed, wreathing her ink-stained fingers with a whisper of sunset. Carefully, Mei inserted the miniature apple tree into its ball of peat, and with a mother\u2019s anxious caution, she drew her hands away. The light-stained glass dropped sharply, only to come to a stop an inch away from her workbench, where it hovered, spinning gently. Mei closed her eyes for a heartbeat, relieved, then she gathered the dragonfly to her with reluctant fingers.\nIt whispered its script into her ear, and when it was done, Mei set it down on the windowsill, and waited until it flicked off into the late afternoon, oblivious to the drop or the stiff seaward breeze. The seafront town was idle during the waning hours of the day, with its few shops starting to pack themselves, crablike, back into their bright-painted shells. The day was too blustery for fishermen, and as Mei closed up shop and locked her narrow door, she was alone on the steep-paved street, with a view wending all the way down to the ship-clustered little harbour, tiled with sloping red and blue rooftops. The great glass dome of the lighthouse, further along the rocky edge of the island, was dulled still: it was yet too early in the day for the light-painted glass to wake.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d offered the steel-geased familiar as Mei pushed into the herbal shop, the brass bell on the shuttered door clonking to announce her approach.\n\u201cAfternoon,\u201d Mei corrected, sliding a silver toll across the counter, and the familiar, today in the shape of an exceedingly slender cat, affected a sigh, eyelids fluttering over mother-of-pearl orbs. It pretended to wash one silvery paw as she hurried past the sandalwood herb cabinets, each unlabelled drawer stacked from floor to ceiling, through the astringent air to the backroom, where she found the Archway still warm to the touch, a steel curve set neatly into stone beside crates of supplies. It activated under her fingers with a soft atonal shudder, and Mei stepped from seablown autumn to humid summer.\nDisoriented, Mei nearly flinched as someone approached her from the side but, as always, her brother only afforded her a distracted glance. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\u201cI came once I received the message.\u201d Mei shot back, and swallowed her instinctive, decades-bred irritation. Ren would have been oblivious to it anyway. Gangly and tall, passably handsome under his unshaven cheeks and tousled hair, Ren looked freshly unearthed from the spec labs, still in his immaculate bespelled coat, buttoned up against the pressed gray-beaded breeches folded over his soft hide shoes, hand-made, all evidence of her brother\u2019s cultivated indifference meshed with their mother\u2019s touch. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n\u201cGrandma thinks that I\u2019m Kai,\u201d Ren said, always with that matter-of-fact tone that read like malice to Mei, but was probably just a spec mage\u2019s clinical detachment. Probably.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said that to me before. What\u2019s gotten worse now?\u201d Mei corrected, and grimaced, regretting the harshness in her tone as she followed Ren through Central Arch to the private wards. The Mount was always busy, even now, its wide, scrupulously clean white corridors thick with patients and healers, its stone and glass wards caked around a manicured garden, tended to by botany adepts. Anyone who passed them gave only Ren a second glance: beside him, with her pale face and her untidy bob of hair, her crumpled gray frock and workman\u2019s boots, Mei was too out of place to register as anyone important.\n\u201cShe probably won\u2019t remember you,\u201d Ren added. Was that relish, or professional detachment? \u201cIt won\u2019t be long now. Once the deterioration starts in the mind, it accelerates.\u201d\nThey ascended a corkscrew stair, and Mei turned her face away, going quiet as her brother rambled on, citing spec theory about the special geometry of an adeptus\u2019 mind, indifferent to her weary silence. Adulthood had ever felt like having their childhood frozen in place and stretched, ill-fitting, over the rest of their lives. The little emperor and the daughter, silent.\nBefore Mother was born, Mei\u2019s five uncles and two aunts had lived like a semi-wild pack of children in the family estate, chased around the tea plantation and its nearby riverlands by a\u2019mahs, ignored by Grandfather, who could always be found Shaping smoke patterns out of his pipe, lounging in a wicker chair by the shade of the villa porch. Sometimes he would leave through the villa Arch, on business that he would not explain. Adeptus business, or so Mei\u2019s aunts had thought, always quick with hero-worship. Mei\u2019s oldest uncle knew better, even as a child, though he would say nothing of it to his siblings for six more decades, long after Grandfather was ash. (He had once seen Grandfather in the colonial town, sitting in a quiet coffeeshop with a painted stranger, another woman, Grandfather\u2019s lean body arched forward with a fiercely indulgent curiosity that he scarcely afforded his own children, her slender silk-cocooned body poised, doll-like, over her china teacup.)\nIf Grandma knew, as she probably did, she seemed not to care. Hers was the province of Shaping fortune, small nuggets of prosperity that she brokered between paper-thin layers of chocolate and sponge, the thousand-layered kueh cake, a family secret that had propelled her bloodline into its permanent position in the Shaperate two generations ago. As an adeptus at sixteen she had been matched to Grandfather, twenty-four, although his Shaping was Avalon-trained and hers weighted in fistfuls and cups and hand-me-down wisdom. In all the sepia pre-war family photographs Mei had seen, Grandma and Grandfather often sat either unsmiling or with small uncertain grins, as though eternally bewildered by their fate.\nAs to the war, by the time Mei was born, it was a textbook wound, inflicted so long ago on the riverlands that time had already stitched its pain away into neat stone memorials and the history section of local schoolbooks. The beaches where men had been lined up at gunpoint in the shallows, single-file, were filled again with children chasing the surf; the bridges where their heads had been left afterwards as silent sentries were now plated over and lush with flowering shrubs.\n\u201cIt was the war,\u201d Mother said once, in an odd non-sequitur, when Mei had, in the way of young girls, shyly and vaguely asked if she could have a pony for the Solstice, knowing full well that the request was hopeless. \u201cGrandfather gave away all his money to the resistance. The plantations and the mines. His position in the Shaperate. Or we would have been very wealthy now. You wouldn\u2019t have to work. I probably wouldn\u2019t have married your father.\u201d She had laughed. Mei had stared, made abruptly uncertain by fate. (In this too, Mei\u2019s oldest uncle knew better, though again he would say not a word of it for decades. The smoke dreams were benevolent servants, but unkind masters.)\nGrandma seemed unconcerned. She had retained her position in the Shaperate, simply by being the oldest surviving member of her bloodline, though as before, she did not attend its meetings, nor even the occasional Consulate flutters. Perched timidly on a stool in Grandma\u2019s stone kitchen, watching Grandma roll out paper-thin sheets of sponge under creased and floury fingers, Mei had once asked why. Grandma had paused, tilting her head, her eyes sunk into a face whose severe button-nosed plainness had been worn by Time along its smile lines, wrinkled lips curling into an impish, uneven grin.\n\u201cWhy would I? Everyone speaks English there,\u201d she said, with supremely elegant indifference, in her native Hakka, and Mei had grinned in response, all unthinking, young enough then to be oblivious to the gentler breeds of cruelty.\nBecause one of Mei\u2019s paternal uncles held a Healer-Shaperate position in the Mont, Grandma\u2019s private ward looked more like a penthouse suite\u2019s bedroom than a hospital room. Large windows looked out over the hospital garden, and bouquets of flowers had been stacked neatly on the wide sill, made riotous by company, roses intermingling with baby\u2019s breath blossoms, lorded over by thick-stemmed sunflowers and hemmed in by bursts of carnations. The hospital bed occupied the far side of the room, hemmed in by its Sentinel frame, catheters and tubing snaking out from under the pale blue sheets. Someone had propped Grandma\u2019s wasting frame up against thick pillows, and she smiled with myopic uncertainty at her visitors, her frail hands pressed over her belly.\nCousin Lea glanced up by Grandma\u2019s bedside, with her usual birdlike, waifish alertness, her hair pulled back into a tight bun at her skull. Father was nowhere to be seen, or any of the uncles, paternal or otherwise. Auntie Mary was making tea, her movements slow and purposeful, and she smiled as Mei stepped into the room behind Ren, nodding towards the closest window, where Mother presided, a swarm of dragonflies perched patiently on the sill, on the window, on the sunflowers, waiting. She listened to one, whispered her answer, and sent it off, smiling and frowning by degrees, resplendent in black silk and brocade, thick earth-brown hair brushed down over aggressively powdered cheeks. She wore no chain of office, needing none: people who stood beside Mother were often surprised by how petite she actually was \u2014 she exuded power as forbiddingly and as coldly as her namesake.\n\u201cMum,\u201d Ren wandered over. \u201cMy sis is here.\u201d\nMother smiled and raised a finger, still whispering to a dragonfly. Mei smiled in response, uncertain, and edged over to the bed, where Lea had pulled up a chair. \u201cAh-poh, Mei is here,\u201d Lea told Grandma encouragingly, in Hakka, and obligingly, Grandma turned her face, very slightly, regarding Mei with a vague curiosity that shocked her. It had been less than a year.\n\u201cSo many people\u2026\u201d Grandma let out a nervous, fluttery laugh, with none of her usual impish warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d She spoke in Hakka, and Mei had to concentrate to parse the language, now. It had been so long since she had spoken anything but English. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Hello.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d Lea said gently, in English.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Ren called from across the room, and for a familiar moment, Mei hated her brother a little. Always a little. Her eyes were stinging. Grief had surprised her after all, as she sat by the bedside with someone for whom she was now a stranger.\n\u201cHow is\u2026\u201d Mei trailed off helplessly. \u201cDid something change? You and Auntie Lily, you\u2019ve both been taking care of her at your place-\u201d\n\u201cRen didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d Lea lowered her voice, as though embarrassed. \u201cThe reason ah-poh is here\u2026 yesterday, she Shaped the wall. In the\u2026 in my kitchen. Opened an Archway. Nearly stepped through, too, to the Gods know where, if\u2026 if Mum hadn\u2019t been there to stop her. They had been making breakfast. Ah-poh became suddenly convinced that \u2018robbers\u2019 were coming to invade \u2018the estate\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cAn unmoored Archway?\u201d Mei blinked, and stared at Grandma, who smiled again at them, letting out another nervous laugh, cast adrift now that no one was speaking Hakka. \u201cShe\u2019s never had that kind of strength.\u201d Or hadn\u2019t she? Mei had never been sure. She had never tried any of Grandma\u2019s thousand-layered cakes. Like her brother, she had been shuttled quickly into a classical Shaperate education. Shaping something as unfathomable and unpredictable as \u2018prosperity\u2019 into food, of all things, smelled uncomfortably like hedge magic, for all that Grandma had retained her Shaperate position until her mandatory retirement.\n\u201cYour brother said that sometimes people can draw more deeply from the Wellspring when they\u2019re emotional. The Shaperate wants someone with her all the time now,\u201d Lea whispered back. \u201cJust in case. If not us, they\u2019d assign someone. A spellbreaker.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, is it?\u201d Mei asked, aghast.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the rules,\u201d Ren pointed out, hovering by the flowers. For once, his perennial sense of self-importance had given way to uncertainty.\n\u201cThey said that they can\u2019t be too careful. Especially after the Archway.\u201d Lea lifted a shoulder into a helpless shrug. \u201cYour Mum\u2019s handling it now.\u201d\nMei flinched as Grandma grasped Lea\u2019s hand, abruptly. \u201cMake tea, Lea. For the guests.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making tea,\u201d Lea agreed in Hakka, as Auntie Mary advanced, pushing a hot cup into Mei\u2019s hand. \u201cLook. She has tea.\u201d\nThe tension seemed to bleed away from frail shoulders: Grandma smiled, relaxing her white-knuckled grip. \u201cHello again. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d She laughed nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 your name\u2026 it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Grandma.\u201d Mei whispered in broken dialect, and sipped her tea, to hide her anguish. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\nMei had visited the riverlands Shaperate only once, tagging on Mother\u2019s heels. With time she would no longer remember the reason why, or very much of the stately colonial building with its green high-domed roof and its splendid white high ceilings, its intricate hand-tiled floors, once the home of the Ambassador-General of the Shaperate-West. (There was no longer a Shaperate-West and East and South, of course, save in sentiment.) Dragonflies darted through the hallways in a constant hum of geased wings, neatly dodging past human traffic, and the occasional familiar crawled or walked or slithered past, purposeful and oblivious. Mei had gawked, her hand swallowed in her mother\u2019s, skipping to keep up.\n\u201cMy daughter, Mei,\u201d Mother would say, whenever she was stopped in the hallways, before speaking business. \u201cYes, she\u2019s enrolled,\u201d she would add sometimes, and rarely, \u201cAthenaem, of course. My old school.\u201d Duly congratulated on her academic and adeptus accomplishments, Mei would smile uncertainly. The adult world was a distant dream, one to which Mei gave little thought to. Had she been told then that someday she would drop off the manicured path towards the Shaperate that life had laid beneath her feet, to live in a seaside town and paint light on glass \u2013 Mei would have shrugged. It would have been all the same to her. But if she had been told that she would defy her mother to do so, she would have been bewildered. Then, and for years more, defiance was unthinkable.\nYears before becoming the family disappointment, however, Mei was hurriedly left in the small Shaperate park, under the watchful eye of a familiar in the shape of a large Japanese crane, its wings swept back over thin mincing legs. Mother had a fire to put out. This was something so common now to Mei\u2019s life that she had followed the crane without a fuss, and had pulled herself up onto a bench, fishing the book she always had ready in her bag into her lap.\nShe made it through a chapter before she vaguely realized that she had an audience: the crane had flicked its wings, in recognition, not alarm. A pair of men were staring at her curiously, surprised on their walk in the park, one stocky and graying at the temples, a Westerner with ginger hair and a florid face, the other a local, younger, dapper and young enough that his narrow face was still spotty at the chin. Both wore the sober gray coats of Shaperate Administration despite the humid heat of the riverlands morning, and now that they had Mei\u2019s attention, the Westerner cleared his throat.\n\u201cHello\u2026 Miss?\u201d He spoke with a thick brogue, one that Mei couldn\u2019t place. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously not lost, she has a Court Familiar,\u201d murmured the local, with a kindly smile. \u201cWaiting for someone?\u201d\nAt Mei\u2019s uncertain nod, the Westerner sighed. \u201cReally, you people. Leaving children with Familiars and maids. Shouldn\u2019t that child be in school?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the school break, sir,\u201d said the local, unperturbed. \u201cWho\u2019s your mum or dad? It\u2019s getting hot out here. If they\u2019re in Council, it\u2019s going to be a while. Maybe you should move indoors.\u201d\nA little resentful now, Mei named her mother, using her maiden name. Mother had never seen the point of changing surnames, not with Shaperate bloodlines on both sides of her own lineage and none on the side of Mei\u2019s father. She watched now, resigned, as both men blinked.\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the Westerner, with a quick smile, meant to disarm. \u201cYou\u2019re the Dragon Lady\u2019s daughter.\u201d\nThey left her alone, hurriedly, and later, Mei related the incident to her mother at lunch, in a quiet little pastry cafe, a short walk away from the Shaperate. Mother had chuckled, amused. \u201cOh yes, Frank and Tim, they\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m always terrorising people. They\u2019re used to it now,\u201d she added, as Mei said nothing, cutting into her quiche with careful flicks of her knife. \u201cBut as a woman in the Shaperate, you have to be fierce. Or you\u2019ll be forgotten. You\u2019ll end up spending your days in absentia, giving the men your vote by proxy.\u201d She shook her head slowly, as though in disdain.\n\u201cIs that normal?\u201d Mei asked, curious now. \u201cI thought that women have been named to the Shaperate for over fifty years now.\u201d\n\u201cMore normal than you would think. It\u2019s not just ability that counts an Adept into the ranks\u2026 and it\u2019s certainly not ability that keeps an Adept relevant in the Shaperate. But by the time you\u2019re in the Shaperate yourself \u2013 if you ever do get there \u2013 hopefully you\u2019ll make the most of it.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Grandma,\u201d Mei said mulishly, still young enough then to love everyone in her life utterly and helplessly, even her brother.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that there was.\u201d Mother said, in a different tone, thoughtful now, and she smiled wryly. \u201cWhen you were very young \u2013 I had to drop you off at the creche, and your a\u2019mah would have to pick you up, and some nights by the time I got home you would be asleep.\u201d Mei nodded cautiously. This was still the case. \u201cOnce, you asked me, \u2018Mum, why do you have to work? All my friends\u2019 mums stay at home. I want you to stay at home, like the other mums.\u2019 I was so hurt\u2026 But to give you the life you have now\u2026 and your future\u2013\u201d Mother hesitated, blinking owlishly, as though with sudden regret. \u201cEat your quiche.\u201d\nIt was only later, years on, that Mei would understand that even her rebellion had been simply a different shade of privilege.\n\u201cThose bloody Consulars,\u201d Mother growled, as the cloud of dragonflies thinned into a trickle. \u201cThink they can lock someone away just for being old!\u201d\n\u201cShe opened an unmoored Archway,\u201d Ren pointed out, forever the only one immune to Mother\u2019s temper. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious matter. A mage who becomes\u2026 unstuck from reality\u2026 is a problem. A Shaper-\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that she was that strong,\u201d Mei muttered, to no one.\n\u201cTreating her like an apostate\u2026 She\u2019s never hurt anyone in her life,\u201d Mother snapped. The dragon, awaking. By the bed, Lea shrunk back a little instinctively, while Auntie Mary scurried out of the ward, murmuring something about getting more water. \u201cThomas and the rest of us are talking it over. But she can\u2019t go into a retirement home now, not if she can still Shape. And we can\u2019t watch her all the time.\u201d\n\u201cSpellbreakers aren\u2019t that bad,\u201d Ren ventured.\n\u201cNot that bad? If they dispel something\u2026 the backlash? She\u2019s too frail for that now. Gods know how she\u2019ll take it!\u201d Mother glared at the dragonflies, as though all of the messengers had somehow failed her after all.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a full dispel. There\u2019s no other way. Unless you want to keep her sedated.\u201d Ren ambled over to the other side of the bed, smiling at Grandma. \u201cHello, ah-poh.\u201d\n\u201cKai,\u201d Grandma beamed, patting his elbow. \u201cYou are so tall now.\u201d\n\u201cSee,\u201d Ren told Mei in English. \u201cThe other day, Cousin Ellie came by with her new baby, and Grandma thought she was Auntie Mary.\u201d\nStop it, Mei wanted to say, but she sipped her tea instead. Her eyes were stinging again. \u201cThis is a good day,\u201d Lea said, almost defensively. \u201cOnce, she left the house and nearly walked off by herself. Luckily Uncle Thomas was visiting.\u201d\n\u201cThe only things she\u2019s Shaped in her life have been kueh,\u201d Mother said, exasperated. \u201cUntil that unmoored Archway, which was probably a fluke. She\u2019s not a danger to anyone.\u201d\nWhat about to herself, Mei thought, but took another sip instead, and felt like a coward. Maybe I could look after her, came the second thought, but it slunk away quickly, embarrassed even in the privacy of her own mind. Love had proved itself insufficient before her instinctive selfishness. Mei squirmed, uncomfortable, and wished for a moment that she was home \u2013 then felt guilty for even thinking such a thing. And so she waited, helpless. It was obvious what was going to happen, anyway. For all that the Dragon would spit and snap and breathe fire, the Consulate had legal primacy, and if they were sending a spellbreaker, then that was the beginning and the end of the matter.\n\u201cShe could have opened it into vacuum,\u201d Ren said, sounding only mildly interested at the possibility. \u201cSpace.\u201d\n\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d Mei asked, unthinkingly.\nRen brightened up, energised by what was essentially, after all, the fundamental question that drove spec adepts and their research. As he started to lecture them all on human limitations and synaptic function, Mei impulsively reached over to grasp Grandma by the palm, startled by how cold her creased fingertips felt. At the touch, Grandma looked away from Ren to Mei, and let out another nervous, stranger\u2019s laugh. \u201cHello.\u201d\nOn the first and last time Mei had ever tried to learn her Grandma\u2019s craft, it was the winter break \u2014 or, more accurately, where the riverlands were concerned, the monsoon break. Rain battered the glass windows and swallowed the back yard, turning the garden into a miniature lake, drowning the flowers, choking the storm drains with torrential runoff. Grandma had decided to make glutinous rice balls, a sweet afternoon snack with kernels of pleasant daydreams, one of Mei\u2019s favourites, and Mei had long given up trying to take notes.\n\u201cAh-poh, not know \u2018feels right\u2019,\u201d Mei complained, hobbled by her uneven, fast-eroding Hakka. Mother, grinding down peanuts into powder, only chuckled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point about craftsmanship. A handful of this, a sprinkle of that, enough flour until it \u2018feels right\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not even Shaping,\u201d Mei added, more comfortable with giving criticism in English.\n\u201cFeel that,\u201d Grandma pushed over the wooden bowl. \u201cThat is \u2018right\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as before,\u201d Mei retorted. \u201cSomeday I\u2019m going to have to do this properly. Make measurements, time it all. The kueh, too.\u201d\n\u201cHow long are you staying?\u201d Grandma asked then, hopeful. \u201cUntil the Lunar New Year?\u201d\n\u201cYes, ah-poh. Until, third month.\u201d University was generous with its semester breaks.\n\u201cAh-h.\u201d Grandma\u2019s creased face wreathed itself with a broad smile. \u201cAny Western boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cAh-poh!\u201d Mei yelped.\nMother pulled a face. \u201cBest not to. I\u2019ve told you. In the Shaperate you deal with all manner of people, and the Westerners-\u201d\n\u201cWesterners are good,\u201d Grandma interrupted, untroubled. \u201cThey only take one wife.\u201d\nIt was Mother\u2019s turn to yelp. \u201cMa.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cTimes have changed in the riverlands, Ma.\u201d\nMei pulled the wooden bowl closer as Grandma chuckled, clearly pleased at having flustered her youngest daughter. Dusting her hands with flour, Mei curled her palms against the sticky dough, and pulled it between her fingertips, comfortable with her ignorance. \u201cWhen I grow up,\u201d she decided out aloud, \u201cI want to be a rice ball adept.\u201d\nMother pulled a face, even as Grandma laughed out loud with a delight so hearty and brilliant that it startled Mei into silence. With pursed lips, Mother wiped away a smudge of flour from Mei\u2019s cheeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d was all she said, and Grandma winked. For a perfect moment in time they were aligned, the craftsman no one understood and the child who would become the same. Blood had bred true. So had everything else. But it would be years and years again before Mei would feel the pride she felt then, in who she was, and whom she had come from, and by then, it would be too late for amends.\n\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Mother hugged Mei afterwards, outside the ward. \u201cVisit more often. I\u2019ll let you know if I move the Shaperate. Are you sure that you can\u2019t stay for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Mei said uncomfortably, even though she could. Lea hovered close by: Auntie Mary was inside the room. \u201cI\u2019ll try to come by more often.\u201d\n\u201cYou have the time anyway,\u201d Ren said dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019re an artist.\u201d\n\u201cRen,\u201d Mother said, though her smile froze briefly. Mei tried to pretend that seeing it didn\u2019t hurt. Maternal pride had died a slow death a long time ago: this was just an occasional spasm, as far as Mei was concerned. \u201cBe happy,\u201d Mother added abruptly, as dragonflies landed on her shoulders. She turned to go, heading briskly down the corridor, whispering to one dragonfly then flicking it impatiently away, still negotiating circumstances.\n\u201cSoo-o,\u201d Ren noted affably, \u201cThe other day-\u201d\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Mei hissed venomously, now that she no longer had to play nice in front of anyone who mattered. Ren smiled at her, a little woodenly, and shambled off, probably heading back to his labs.\n\u201cMei,\u201d Lea said gently, and Mei nearly jumped. She\u2019d forgotten that Lea was there. \u201cHere,\u201d Lea pressed a little sandalwood box into her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s from the last set. She would have wanted you to have it.\u201d Before Mei could answer, Lea had opened the door to the room, slipping back inside.\nMei took her time returning to Central Arch, in case she met someone she recognised, and took an Arch back to her seaside town with relief. The herbal shop was still empty, though the familiar was now a parrot, and it clicked its beak at her in greeting as she hurried past, no longer in the mood for niceties. It was dark enough now that the lighthouse glow was a brilliant candle of orange and gold against the speckled dark of the midnight sky, but Mei didn\u2019t stop to study it, breathless as she rushed away, exhausted by the time she clattered home and locked the world away behind her.\nThe floating globe still spun gently above her workbench, and Mei set the sandalwood box down beside it, sinking into her chair, abruptly listless, and watched the tiny little tree turn this way and that, its miniature Shaped leaves quivering in the seaward breeze from the window. Dancing. In the afternoon it had been beautiful. Now it seemed trivial. Unfinished.\nMei drew the sandalwood box towards her, and flicked up the lid, and though she knew what she would find, she still felt lightheaded as she saw the little square kueh within, golden in the magelight from her lamps, perfect. She held the box close to her face, breathing in sandalwood and chocolate and spice. Gently, Mei broke off a piece from the corner, and pushed it with a fingertip under the roots of the miniature tree. Then, as her throat ached, as her eyes grew scratchy once more, in the silence of her life Mei scooped up the rest and set it on her tongue, savoring it as it melted down, buttery and sweet with yesterday\u2019s dreams.\nAnya Ow grew up in Singapore and moved to Melbourne to study law.

What are they for?\u201d\nJeb sniffed a flower, tenderly. A faint spicy, floral scent drifted to eir nose, against the musty background smell of soil. The flowers smelt a little like jasmine, though they were not jasmine. Ey almost fancied ey could hear the small creatures shifting below the surface soil, worms and beetles curled up sleeping.\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re here to be lovely,\u201d Jeb said. Ey turned over another bloom carefully, looking for insect damage. \u201cSame as any flower.\u201d\nNederene huffed, and dropped down on preer haunches. The faery had an elegant way about prin, those stark and dramatic eyes and legs with rather more joints than any human Jeb knew. But pry could still feel like a petulant child. \u201cYou know that is not what I meant! Do not \u2018mess\u2019. What magic have you put in them!\u201d\nJeb thought ey felt a tingle coming from the flower where ey touched it, coursing up eir arm. Ey withdrew eir hand. \u201cI\u2019m still not convinced I do that,\u201d ey said, stalling. Then: \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll know once they\u2019ve grown, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWaiting for things to grow\u2026\u201d Nederene tilted preer head. \u201cSilly use of time really, when you small ones get so little of it.\u201d\nJeb stood up, brushing soil off eir knees. Smudges of brown stayed on the green corduroy. Every item of clothing Jeb owned was green, except the ones that were brown. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I plan to set up camp here until they\u2019re done,\u201d ey said amused. \u201cWatched pot never boils.\u201d\n\u201cUntrue,\u201d Nederene said, pointing one long finger at em. \u201cOne of your language-lies.\u201d Pry looked delighted.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jeb said, sighing out. The air here was pleasant, crisp and stirring in eir lungs. \u201cYou found it.\u201d\nWhatever charm they bore, the flowers were nearly grown. Jeb realised with a start that slow as the seasons seemed to turn, spring would soon be over, and summer here. Nederene wouldn\u2019t be a pry any more. Ey didn\u2019t know if pry wanted em to use the same words as last year or a different set, though pry had been consistent so far: O, ors, orself was probably Jeb\u2019s favourite of preers, but autumn was a while off. Ey would have to ask prin.\nIt was odd, being friends with one of the fae. Pronoun sets were the least of it, of course; Jeb even had human friends who rotated theirs, though not with the seasons, not as spring bloomed into summer mellowed into autumn crept slowly into winter\u2019s sleep. This thing, the plants Jeb grew having odd properties and growing too fast, that had never happened before ey met Nederene. No one else seemed able to find the garden, either.\n\u201cI hope you will stay alive long enough for them to grow,\u201d Nederene said, swinging graceful into step. Pry gave em a look that ey interpreted roughly as anxious. \u201cOh so little time.\u201d\n\u201cI should have at least another twenty years, touch wood.\u201d\nNederene\u2019s shoulders bunched up around preer ears. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d pry said, sort of hollow and anxious.\n\u201cLanguage-lies, sorry. Sorry. I\u2019m sure I should be fine.\u201d Ey should be, yes. Jeb sighed. Looked up to find eir friend surveying em with bright birdlike eyes, fretful, as though expecting Jeb to die of plague on the spot. Jeb shook eir head. \u201cThe flowers aren\u2019t ready, but here, I still have a gift for you.\u201d Ey plucked a leaf from a bush that wouldn\u2019t miss it, and reached up. Nederene hunkered down, and Jeb tucked the leaf behind the faery\u2019s ear. \u201cThere you are. Now you\u2019ll be very dashing for all the other fae ladies and gentlemen and others.\u201d\n\u201cI already have partners for the next five dances,\u201d pry said, glancing at Jeb out of one eye as though expecting em to be impressed. Jeb nodded solemnly. Nederene stood up straight and trilled. \u201cAnd what of you! You told me last time that you met someone, have you \u2026\u201d Pry winked. \u201cMet them again?\u201d\nJeb let out a soft huff of laughter. Then shook eir head.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Nederene said, and patted eir shoulder. \u201cApologies if this saddens you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. We did meet again. She \u2026 didn\u2019t feel the same way, but that was fine,\u201d Jeb said, lifting eir hands in defence of an allegation Nederene hadn\u2019t made. \u201cThat was fine, of course, and we ended up \u2026 quite good friends. I think we\u2019re good friends.\u201d\nNederene rasped preer fingers together, a noise that put Jeb in mind of crickets chirping. Jeb shrugged.\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t doing well,\u201d ey said to the unasked question.\nNederene let out a soft keen, further back in the throat than any human sound. Pry loped over the gardenbed and bowed preer head, pushed it forward so their heads were pressed together. After a moment pry lifted preer arms, awkwardness in more than just the offering of the gesture but the shape of it, ungainly as a stork.\nJeb had been prideful at one point in eir life, but all ey could think about was Eun\u2019s face, the pallor in it, how odd she looked with her head shaved bare. Ey leaned silently into the embrace.\nNederene was colder than a human, and felt vaguely sharp. All the comparisons that came to Jeb\u2019s mind were faintly insulting: a jangle of trowels, origami made of spun wire. Ey let out a short unfamiliar laugh, and then closed eir mouth on the sobs that wanted to follow it.\n\u201cThere there there,\u201d Nederene said softly, halfway to sing-song. Preer voice was soothing, the wind through leaves. \u201cThere there there there.\u201d\nJeb squeezed eir friend tightly, all the unfamiliar shapes, and the familiar intent. After a while, feeling calmer, ey opened eir eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re very thin, you know.\u201d\nNederene pulled back with a screech of a laugh. \u201cWith all my kind it is such! At least in this century.\u201d\nWell, alright then. \u201cYou know, I used to want to be like you,\u201d Jeb said with a wave at Nederene\u2019s bone-razor thinness. \u201cOnce.\u201d Ey felt drifting, strange, a good time to take sanctuary in what ey knew was true. \u201cLately, sometimes, I want to be bigger. Like a mountain, like a tree. Like an old stone covered in moss. A bulwark for my friends to be safe in.\u201d\nEy closed eir eyes again. Things felt safer this way. This garden, with its walls of trees, could be anywhere, then. Could be some other world. If fairies were real why couldn\u2019t there be some other world? Where Jeb was happy and Eun was safe.\nNederene\u2019s voice seemed thin with distance when pry spoke. \u201cI think you\u2019re that already,\u201d pry said. Then, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nHere. Here, with a moth buzzing somewhere unseen in the undergrowth, the air just starting to get cold enough to bite. Ey was here. Jeb opened eir eyes, hesitated. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d\nNederene stretched out. \u201cI am here,\u201d pry said.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThere was nothing else to be done today. The weeds had been plucked, the wrong insects discouraged and the right ones safeguarded. More scraps placed on the compost, and the flowers coming along well, but not grown yet. There seemed no reason to linger, though ey wanted to; wanted to with the slow torpor that came of not wanting to do anything else.\nJeb started walking, taking the path that would lead em home. The trick was not to think too hard on it, to think of other things, but Jeb didn\u2019t want to think at all right now. Ey focused on the immediate path, the crunch of shells.\nNederene stalked beside em, a silent presence. When they\u2019d first met, even for the first several months afterwards, Jeb had found prin quite frightening.\nNothing for a while but the crunch, crunch of shells, and the soft barely audible whisper Nederene made when moving. \u201cMaybe they will heal, this batch,\u201d pry said tentatively. \u201cMaybe your friend will be all-manner-of-well, after a tilt of flower juices.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Unlikely.\nA few steps more, Jeb\u2019s conscience smote em, and ey added, \u201cThank you, my friend.\u201d\n\u201cAlways. I will be here for you for at least the next fifty years.\u201d\nSomething in that was almost soothing. Sometimes Nederene was childish and felt young as a flower barely into blooming, like fresh new shoots. Or in the winter like a mad and merry thing, cracking ice and flexing fingers. Sometimes pry felt like how it felt to stand beside an old boulder, or at the bottom of a cliff, by the trees that eight people linking hands couldn\u2019t form a circle around: the comforting, alarming feeling of being near something larger and older than yourself, a tangible ancient thing. Jeb smiled.\n\u201cUntil then I\u2019ll see you in a week,\u201d ey said, lightly teasing.\n\u201cStay alive, you and all those you love.\u201d\n\u201cStay alive, you and all those you love,\u201d Jeb replied, formally. Nederene dipped preer head in a bow, a fond gesture for prin, and then Jeb was walking alone out of a narrow alleyway, graffiti on the corrugated iron fences showing cities, faces, cartoon characters, cars passing here and there in the street ahead.\nRem Wignore, also published under Summer Wigmore, is a speculative fiction writer based in Wellington.

Mitchell","hostname":"capricioussf.org","date":"January 2018","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"by Lauren E. Mitchell\nThe topmost room of the lighthouse is given over to the vast hot lamp that illuminates the sky from dusk until dawn. Below that is the watch-room, where the great cans of fuel for the lamp are arrayed around the walls, and the lighthouse keeper\u2019s desk and chair sit facing out to sea. Her logbook is filled with precise small handwriting: observations on the weather, the stars, and the names of the ships that pass her tiny, rock-toothed island safely by.\nBelow that is the music room. Its door mostly stays closed; the blue paint is softened and faded by dust. There\u2019s a saxophone and a clarinet and a cello. She can play none of them; her instrument was always the piano, but who brings a piano to a lighthouse? No, these are an artefact of those who came before her, and she keeps telling herself that she should clean the room out, but she never does.\nHer bedroom comes next. It\u2019s the only room where the windows are permanently shuttered, for her night runs from dawn until dusk and the sunlight not only permeates her eyelids, but overheats the room in the summer months. She has a big bed for just one person, spread with a handmade patchwork quilt, a thick warm one in the winter and a thin one, almost as thin as a sheet, in the summer. In summer she lies very still and has difficulty sleeping, thinking of the oil cans overhead, wondering if they will stay safe and sealed and not overheat and combust. In winter she curls into a ball under the quilt and sleeps soundly, the wail of the wind a curious lullaby. There\u2019s a tiny wardrobe built in along one curve of the wall where she hangs her succession of plain white t-shirts and plain blue jeans. At one end there\u2019s a thick windbreaker, but she\u2019s grown used to the rain and the wind and rarely wears it. She does wear a shapeless woollen hat, though, not so much because of the weather as because her grandmother knitted it for her. It is the same rainbow clash of colours as the quilts.\nThe last room above ground level is the storage room, lined with racks of canned food, freeze-dried food, and other supplies designed to last as long as possible. The supply boat comes once every six weeks from the mainland with fresh fruit and vegetables; the lighthouse keeper makes them last as long as she can. It also brings letters from home, and she makes those last as well, averaging the pages out over the nights until the boat is due again, writing her replies as she reads through so that when the boat returns she has the envelopes ready.\nThe ground floor is almost empty. Though tiny, the island is not flat, but nonetheless the waves can still rise up to engulf the ground floor, and after losing two good pairs of boots to the water the lighthouse keeper has learned not to keep anything in it. Yet it is not entirely empty; an intricate mural, coloured square by square, marches around the walls, each square a month in the life of whoever tends the light. There is a neat white square between each succession of squares, with the name of the previous keeper and the dates of their keeping written in the centre. The current keeper has quite enjoyed filling out her squares with the paint kept in the storage room; hers are mostly pictures of the flowers and plants that cling tenaciously to cracks in the rock, unlike the merfolk and sea-monsters and shipwrecks that are dotted throughout the earlier rows of images. She has always admired life that survives in unlikely places.\nShe rises at dusk and sleeps not long after dawn; it\u2019s one dawn long into her keepership when, going down to the shore to check her crab traps, she at last meets a merfolk.\nThey have pulled themself ashore from whatever undersea kingdom it is that they inhabit to lie on the little beach between the rock formations on the eastern side of the island, where the tide pools are biggest. Their head is pillowed on their arms, their hair a damp tangle of curls the same golden colour as the early morning waves burnished by the rising sun. Their skin is a lighter shade of pinked gold that could either be a tan or just the way that the sunrise hits their skin. At first she is afraid that they are dead, but as she cautiously steps closer she can see the rise and fall of their breathing. They\u2019re lying on their stomach; their spine curves gracefully down and their hips flare out, but then there\u2019s another inward curve and instead of splitting into two legs their lower extremities are fused together in a graceful, pearlescent tail. Their scales are patterned coral-red and anemone-orange, and the fin at the end of their tail shades from pink to purple like the inside of a pipi. They splash it lazily in the lapping waves. Her crab cages lie empty beside them.\nThere\u2019s only one thing that she can think of to say, and that\u2019s a simple, \u201cHello?\u201d Her voice is rusty from disuse.\nTheir head snaps up from their arms and they look up at her, green eyes wide and fearful. They start to scrabble backwards on their elbows into the foam.\n\u201cWait!\u201d\nSurprisingly, they stop, rolling from their stomach to their back and sitting up. Their chest is caked with gritty sand that does little to cover the small smooth swells beneath it. Their neck is smooth save for two thin gill slits on either side of their throat, closed over as they sit on shore. A neatly braided beard hangs golden from their chin, threaded with shells and pearls. The beard extends up their cheeks as little more than damp fluff, meeting their hairline alongside ears with little seahorse frills. Another tuft of gold bristles over their upper lip.\n\u201cHello,\u201d they say carefully, and then, \u201cI ate your crabs.\u201d\nShe looks at the empty cages. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d they offer.\n\u201cI\u2014it\u2019s all right. I can catch more.\u201d She tucks her hands into her pockets and watches their curious gaze rove over her jeans and boots. She can\u2019t blame them for staring; she\u2019s staring just as much, trying to focus on their tail rather than on anything else, like the triangular patch of darker scales she can\u2019t help thinking of as being between their legs, though they have no legs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you before.\u201d She says it at the same time as the merfolk.\nTheir laugh is truly bubbly. \u201cI don\u2019t usually come to shore here, but the crabs smelled good.\u201d They diffidently brush some of the sand off their chest, utterly unselfconscious, and she can feel the beginnings of helpless arousal stirring in her. The sand catches in the downy hair that starts at their clavicle and arrows down between their breasts, petering out just above their navel. In places it glints red or orange instead of gold, like coral. She can\u2019t keep from looking. \u2018They\u2019re harder to catch further out.\u2019\n\u201cYou don\u2019t trap them?\u201d She hunkers down, hands on her knees.\n\u201cOh, we do, but the crabs are bigger.\u201d They make a gesture encompassing a shell the size of a dinner plate, claws the size of their small hands, and wince. She thinks of steamed crab with hot butter, eaten in the topmost room looking out over the darkness, and knows that\u2019s not how it is for them.\n\u201cHow do you live down there?\u201d she asks abruptly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it too cold and wet?\u201d\nThey think for a moment and then shrug. \u201cNot when you\u2019re used to it. How do you live up here? Isn\u2019t it too hot and dry?\u201d\n\u201cNot when you\u2019re used to it,\u201d she says, and they share another laugh, as though this is a perfectly ordinary conversation. When they laugh the delicate flaps on the sides of their neck flutter a little. Then, when they brush more sand off their front, she sees the fine webbing between their fingers, stretching between the second knuckles. They catch her looking and lift their hand to press it against hers.\nShe expects clamminess, the cold of the deep sea, but instead their skin\u2019s just pleasantly cool on her palm, like a drink of fresh water on a warm day. Their hand is smaller than hers but she can see from the muscling of their shoulders and upper arms that they possess a good deal of physical strength. They must need it, to be able to swim against the tide, against the pressure of the ocean.\nFor a moment their fingers intertwine, and then the merfolk pulls their hand away.\n\u201cI should go,\u201d they say, and rolls adroitly sideways into the salty sea foam.\n\u201cWait!\u201d she calls after them. \u201cWill I see you again?\u201d But they have dived beneath the waves, vanished into the deep, a sunbeam gone into darkness.\nShe sighs, stands up, and picks up the crab traps to rebait and reset, if not for herself, then in the hopes of luring them to her shore again.\n\u201cYou taste like the sea,\u201d they say, lifting their mouth from her.\nShe hasn\u2019t the breath to reply, lying half in and half out of the waves like a drowning sailor washed to shore, but it\u2019s not her gasping mouth they\u2019ve been applying theirs to. Her clothes are scattered somewhere above the high tide line. \u201cLike oysters, or lost copper pennies.\u201d\nShe still can\u2019t respond. They laugh and slap their sunrise tail against the water, splashing them both. \u201cYou\u2019re like a squeezed-out sponge.\u201d\nThis draws a reaction from her at last; she rolls onto her side and begins to stroke their hair, carefully combing the ever-present tangles out with her fingers. She says nothing, but she knows that she does not want to be a sponge, simply soaking up their presence and the pleasure that they bring her. They nudge their head against her hand and she draws them closer. When they kiss she can taste herself in their mouth. She doesn\u2019t know if she does taste like the sea, the way that they claim; it seems to her that the taste of the sea is what\u2019s left in their mouth once every last trace of herself is gone.\nOne night, as the sun sinks below the horizon, she goes down to the water where they usually meet and they are not there. She waits as long as she can, but the lamp must be lit and there is no sign of them.\nIt\u2019s only when she finally walks back up the shallow, seaweed-encrusted steps that she sees them. She doesn\u2019t know how she missed seeing them on the way down, but perhaps she was hurrying, heedless of what was at her feet thanks to her anticipation of what would be on the beach.\nThey are huddled about halfway up the steps, skin gleaming coldly in the moonlight. The first thought that strikes her is how pale they are all over, how much of a contrast this is to their sunlight self.\nThe second thought, which should have been the first thought, is that they have legs.\nTheir feet and ankles are striped with blood. They are breathing normally, but the fine slits on the sides of their throat have vanished. She lifts them into her arms and then is torn whether to take them up to the lighthouse or back down to the sea. At last she chooses up, carries them step by step to the solid front door, which stands open, waiting for them. The mural stares at them with dozens of faces as they enter the ground floor room and she kicks the door shut behind them against the rising whistle of the wind.\nShe is still uncertain whether this is right or wrong, but she takes them up the spiral stairs anyway, stopping in the storage room to rinse the blood from their legs. They stir a little in her arms when the cold water hits their skin, but does not wake. She cannot see any cuts or wounds on their feet; there is no visible reason for the blood, but it is streaked a long way up their legs and her imagination fills in the details.\nA cosy bed is a strange place for a merfolk, but it\u2019s where she puts them, tucking the quilt around them and fluffing one of the pillows under their head. She feels guilty about leaving them there, but she has to tend the light; it is full dark now and the ships will be sailing regardless of whether she has a visitor. She goes up the last spirals of stairs, past the music room door, to the lamp room. The wind makes it chilly, but she ignores the cold, lighting the lamp and feeling the space heat instantly. It\u2019s a rare night that she has to do anything but sit here, but she makes sure the fuel reservoir is well-filled and that there are no specks of dust on the lamp\u2019s glass to block even the smallest ray of light. Once she has done all that she goes back downstairs to her bedroom.\nThey are sitting up against the pillows and watching the door. Their eyes are unfocused but retain their green clarity. Horribly, she thinks that their expression must match that of drowning victims in the seconds before death glazes their eyes right over. She opts not to share this comparison with them and just sits down beside them on the bed, reaching for their hand. Even the webs between their fingers have vanished; this transformation, whatever has caused it, is extraordinarily thorough.\nTheir eyes focus on her when she touches their hand. It\u2019s a vast improvement over the vacant stare. They smile and touch their throat, and then their lips, and then shake their head.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she says, but she is afraid that she does.\nTheir brow furrows in frustration and they repeat the gestures, this time with a rougher gesture across their lips. She doesn\u2019t know what to say to their muteness and then it doesn\u2019t matter anyway because they silence her unspoken words with a kiss, fervent and deep and needing-wanting-hungering.\nThey have always met in the shallows between their worlds; this is a chance to show them the comfort of her bed, instead of sand and stone.\n\u201cShould we do this? I don\u2019t want to harm you,\u201d she says.\nThey give her an impatient look, and guide her hand to their breast, and she loses all desire to protest when this is so clearly what they want. She sets about learning their body anew, touching and caressing those places that were closed and scaled and are now open: warm, wet, hard, soft. They make no sound but the arching of their back and the flexing of their muscles tell her all she needs to know, not to mention the way they gather her hair in their hand when she goes down on her belly between their legs, smiling up at them before lowering her face to them.\nAnd now she knows the true taste of the sea. It is dark and secret and deep and she wants to throw herself into them and drown.\nShe lifts her mouth from them and then rises from the bed to unlatch the shutters, pulling them open. The light that flashes out across the sea powerfully illuminates the bedroom; she can be certain that it has not gone out.\nBut when she returns to the bed and to them, before long she can see nothing but them and their body entwined with hers. She can feel only the way that they move beneath her, above her, with her.\nIt is a long, long time before they sleep, curled together under the quilt. She latches the shutters again but she feels certain that the light will not go out, not on this night. The sound of the waves far below lulls them to sleep even in this strange place and she is not far behind them, listening to their breath, their chest rising and falling like the ebb and flow of the water.\nAs always she feels the dawn in her bones. Usually she is looking out to sea when the sun first peeks over the horizon, but not this time. She opens her eyes and slips out of bed to open the shutters again, letting the first light into the room, and then hurries quietly upstairs to turn out the lamp. She stands for a minute looking out; the sky is a leaden grey and the wind has whipped the waves into a frenzy, but despite this she is cheerful. They will find ways to communicate, and she will care for them, and she will no longer be alone. Solitude is a way of life that suits her, but it is growing harder to appreciate the longer that she knows them. She casts one last look at the ominous low clouds and then goes back down towards her bedroom.\nAs she passes the closed music room door, she heard the soft, mournful strains of a funeral march begin.\nThe clarinet is unbearably sweet-sounding. The saxophone should be too cheerful but somehow isn\u2019t, sounding like the keening of the gulls that often circle the tower. The cello weaves the two together. And it is impossible for all three to be playing, because there is nobody in the lighthouse except for herself and the merfolk. Besides, how would a being of the sea know how to play any of the instruments?\nShe jerks the door open angrily and sees all three instruments sitting in their dusty cases, just as they always have.\nA sudden fear seizes her, and not because she is the kind of woman given to believing in ghost stories or anything of that sort. She slams the door shut and pelts down the remaining stairs to her open bedroom door, but not fast enough to escape the resumption of the music, which is decidedly not music to her ears.\nThe quilt has fallen to the floor. They lie on the bed, their face once again too pale, shining tail slapping against the stone and shedding scales. She runs to their side, seeing the final seconds of the transformation completing itself; the gills open again on the sides of their neck.\nThey are harder to carry in this form, but she lifts them anyway, taking the stairs two at a time and kicking the door open against the wind. The steps down to the beach are slippery with wet seaweed and kelp thrown up by the tide; she takes them recklessly, painfully aware of the merfolk\u2019s almost non-existent breathing.\nShe can\u2019t get to the bottom of the steps; the waves have risen to the high tide mark and beyond, foam spuming up another yard beyond that. She is hesitant to just let them go into the maw of the sea when they are in this state, but is unsure what else to do.\nThe solid rock outcropping to her left catches her eye. She hastens back up the steps and walks out onto it. Every footstep is sure and steady despite how treacherous the surface is. She stands at the edge of the drop with them in her arms and looks down at the ocean roiling below.\nIf the merfolk are real, will the sea monsters be real as well?\nThey fall together in silence. The water opens to accept them both with barely a splash.\nThe supply boat comes when the waves die down and the island is safe to approach once more. It brings fresh crates of food, and a new lighthouse keeper.\nShe enters the lighthouse with trepidation and then feels it fade away as she sees the mural on the wall. While the man brings in the crates from the boat, she stands with her hands linked behind her back and looks at the paintings. The oldest ones are dull and dusty; she makes a mental note to wipe the walls down, maybe touch up some of the more chipped areas, when she\u2019s got time. The newest ones are so fresh they could have been done yesterday, although the island has been abandoned for a week.\nThe last picture is a fascinating work of imagination; a merfolk and a woman, poised above the sea in mid-jump. Below the waves glitters a fabulous palace.\nShe wonders if she will ever find out what happened to the former lighthouse keeper and thinks it\u2019s better if she doesn\u2019t.\nIn the meantime, she has a lighthouse to tend\u2026 and a painting of her own to begin.\nLauren E.

It was just a small one, far from populated areas and, most importantly (as Exelle explained to her mother and friends), predicted.\n\u201cThe only casualties were because people actually went to watch,\u201d she told them. \u201cEveryone who wanted to avoid it did, but some idiots wanted to see the lava flows up close, and even in that group only a few were caught in it.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t do that, will you?\u201d her mother asked.\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d Exelle said. She wasn\u2019t going to Earth to chase after thrills or prove anything.\n\u201cSo why are you going?\u201d her soul-friend Saiwai asked, when Exelle repeated the conversation with her. \u201cI mean, no matter what you say, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s where we come from.\u201d Exelle answered as emphatically as she could. Her own conviction was fading in proportion to the drastic news coverage of the rupture.\n\u201cYeah, and there\u2019s a reason we left,\u201d Saiwai said. \u201cThe whole planet is going to fall apart.\u201d\n\u201cNot for hundreds of cycles!\u201d The problem was, of course, that nobody knew exactly when; it could be in hundreds of cycles, it could be next cycle. But most experts said hundreds, and Exelle thought the fact that they had accurately (or almost accurately) predicted the place and time of the latest rupture was a good sign.\nAnd so she went. She was signed up and her ticket was paid and everyone knew she was going, so however many urgent last-breath fears she had, however strong that sense of certainty that she was committing time-delayed suicide, she had to go. Or so she told herself, and so she went.\nOne of the commitments that kept her going was the acceptance to Xinsibirsk Dashu, the best university (left) on Earth. She landed there on a warm late winter morning, woozy from the long space journey and the worry, barely able to note the strange smells that her ancestors\u2019 noses had evolved in tandem with, the strange angle of the sunlight. The strange everything, really. She crawled into the capsule assigned to her in the extraterrestrials\u2019 dorm and slept until she woke up.\nThe classes and the routine helped her manage the sense of strangeness for a while. There were relatively few extraterrestrials at that point, with the (overblown, everyone assured her) concerns about the ruptures and eventual orbital instability, but there had been a time when many came to experience a few cycles on Earth, and the facilities still existed to make them feel at home. She could live almost like she was still on Sebrang, if she wanted to. But Exelle discovered a thirst for difference. She turned off her translator sometimes, in class; at first for a vertiginous few moments of incomprehension, and then (after she discovered the subtitles function) for longer periods, until she started to pick out familiar words through the antiquated rhythms.\nShe started trying out Earthling words on her Earthling classmates. It was hard to tell which were friends, and which were just people willing to talk to her about her research. Exelle was warned before she left about how \u201cfriendly\u201d Earthlings could be, how their culture was very direct and hospitable and expressive, and she shouldn\u2019t misinterpret it. The Sebrang Encyclopedia of Interplanetary Anthropology was the most explicit about it, in language that Exelle found positively xenophobic: \u201cMany visitors\u201d (no citation!) \u201chave reported that after being received with overwhelming smiles and invitations, they were disappointed to be betrayed in large or small ways by their Earthling hosts, to the point of wondering whether they were welcome there at all.\u201d\nExelle\u2019s favorite anthropology professor back on Sebrang had made it clear that they could pretty much assume they weren\u2019t welcome, wherever they went. \u201cWho really likes being studied?\u201d she would ask the class rhetorically. \u201cOkay, there is some novelty, maybe even some glamour, in having someone so interested in you. But with time you will start to wonder why. What is it about you that is so freakish or foreign that it deserves methodological examination?\u201d\nExelle was not, then, completely na\u00efve when she arrived on Earth. But even with these layers of warning, she found it difficult to figure out how to act around Earthlings. They were very friendly, very warm. People she had barely nodded to in class would call out from the other end of the atmoshield, waving their pale earthling arms at her. In study circles there was an unexpected amount of touching \u2013 elbows joshing elbows, taps on knees or shoulders.\nIt was also hard to calibrate because at the same time, Exelle\u2019s feelings about herself had changed. At home, she was just on the gangly edge of normal size, almost too tall, sometimes awkward. Here, she was tiny, petite, delicate. She was also darker than most Earthlings. They smiled at her more than people smiled at her at home, and she had to keep reminding herself that they smiled at everyone more than people did at home. All this combined to make her feel far more attractive than usual. When people stared at her as she walked around campus, she wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because she was an extraterrestrial or whether, maybe, it was because they wanted to touch her.\nShe did try to keep on professional ground with her research assistant, Starfish. Exelle spent the first cycle or two wondering which of his personal characteristics had led to that nickname, but then she learned that it had been, at various times in Earth history, trendy for parents to name their newborns after species that had recently gone extinct. Thus (among the Earthlings in her classes or that Starfish introduced her to) Lepidopter; Pacifica; Anteater. Some of these names were then passed down from generation to generation, resulting in Tigers and Honeybees that were centuries away from having cohabited the planet with their namesakes.\nThe campus canteens, especially the Mars Bar (amazing how these offensive jokes persisted), had ingredients shipped in from other planets, meaning that Exelle could consume at least fairly decent approximations of what she was used to. But long before Starfish hesitantly suggested it Exelle knew from her background reading that food was very important in Earthling culture, and that she needed to take potential interviewees out to eat.\nAt first she found their limited cuisine mildly distasteful, especially the cheap food available near the university: greasy, heavy dogmeat deep-fried in egg yolk, or barley pancakes dripped with chemical sugar. But people would always ask her how she liked it, and Exelle was not talented at polite lies, as these were not particularly valued on Sebrang. Eventually Starfish and Ybor, another occasional translator, found a couple of restaurants she could actually look forward to. There was a vegetarian place not far from her dorm that had simple but tasty dishes, and a bar called Pijo a few blocks further away, nearer to the town proper, that did creative and artificial flavoring-free renditions of various traditional dishes. It was there, too, that Exelle learned about beer.\nAlcohol had the status of an illegal drug on Sebrang, although moderate use was tolerated in certain subsets of the human community, and Exelle had never had more than a surreptitious sip or two. She didn\u2019t understand the point of it, and certainly not why it might be worth time in penitentiary, especially since it was well known that alcohol could also make people violent and unhappy. The bar made her very nervous the first time she went in; not only did everyone have alcoholic drinks in front of them, but most of them were armed, something which never, she told Starfish in undertones, happened on Sebrang.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry so much,\u201d he told her, but the fear of being killed in an indiscriminate bar brawl layered over the fear, always with her since she had arrived, of dying in an unexpected rupture or the apocalypse. The interview went badly, as Exelle kept losing focus to dart her eyes around the room looking for early warning signs, and she went home early, slept poorly, and missed her first two classes the next morning.\nAfter that Starfish was hesitant to take her to Pijo again, but when another interview subject (a woman from whose family at least one person had emigrated in each of the past twenty generations) suggested it as a meeting point, Exelle insisted that they go. She didn\u2019t drink, and still felt on guard the whole time, but she was able to see that the Earthlings there were relaxed and enjoying themselves and that no one was worried about the weapons. After that they did a number of interviews there, and eventually, goaded by the amused comments from interviewees, Exelle even learned to manage half a glass of beer. Starfish assured her it had relatively little alcohol, only 30%.\nIt was also at Pijo that she first used a spoon; on Sebrang, due to the physiology of the native inhabitants, food was usually consumed more directly. She had read about spoons before, of course, but it was not until she saw two of them slotted together that she suddenly understood the derivation of the Earthling idiom for \u201clying curled together.\u201d It was a usage that she had learned recently.\nDuring the second half of her time on Earth, Exelle had no classes, and was expected to spend all her time on her research. Before her time in the classroom completely ended though, she started dating an Earthling she had been exchanging glances with all semester. At first she was cautious with him, aware that even with the help of the automatic translators and body language annotators there could misunderstandings, aware that Earthlings (\u201cliving closer to death\u201d as the Encyclopedia of Anthropology noted with unhelpful, unsubstantiated interpretation) had a culture more accepting of easy sexual relations. But Linsed was respectful and careful, and Exelle enjoyed her time with him. Once he told her that she was not his first extraterrestrial relationship, which immediately made her wonder if he had an extraterrestrial fetish, or if he was looking for an emigration ticket. In any case, she told herself, she didn\u2019t think it was a relationship destined for the long-term.\nOccasionally she would wonder, completely out of context, what exactly were the large and small ways in which previous visitors had been betrayed by Earthlings. If the encyclopedia was going to be so folkloric, it ought to include the stories and examples, she thought.\nShe was careful not to talk about or display her relationship in front of Starfish, since she suspected him, with his courteousness and thoughtfulness, of harboring a crush on her. They would be working ever more closely together during the research phase of her study, and she didn\u2019t want to confuse things, or upset him. Then, as her Earthling language comprehension got better, she overheard him one day talking with an interview subject about his family. She had never thought of him as married.\nWhen a new rupture was forecast, it was the talk of the campus. Everyone was making plans to go. \u201cIt\u2019s like a carnival,\u201d Exelle\u2019s boyfriend Linsed told her. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be great!\u201d The rupture was predicted to occur in the middle of the ocean, not far from where the ancient city of Jakarta lay under the surface, and Linsed was eager to get some diving in while they were there.\n\u201cDiving? At the site of a predicted rupture? You must be crazy,\u201d Exelle told him, and stormed off.\nBut everyone was talking about it, everyone was going. When Exelle heard that Starfish was not only going, but would be taking his two small children with him, she relented and told Linsed they could go. Because she was still a little nervous, she told him they were going to stay in one of the expensive pop-up hotels rather than camping in the university atmosphere shield that was being set up. He seemed almost disappointed by this, even when she told him she\u2019d pay the full bill, and when they got there she could understand why: the carnival was definitely in the landing-strip sized, bubble-shaped atmoshields that were being moored all around the predicted location, and not in their hotel, where most of the clients were middle-aged to elderly. But the rupture hadn\u2019t happened yet, and Exelle was just as happy to sleep in the quiet, heavily reinforced hotel and spend the jumpy days out in the university atmoshield.\nAs the days went by everyone got a bit more nervous. During the burning afternoons, as they listened to bands or courted various kinds of highs on the fake grass of the atmoshield, the students whined that if the rupture didn\u2019t happen soon they\u2019d have to go back to class and miss it. Exelle suspected they were anxious for it to occur soon because the last rupture predictions were off by thirteen miles and two days, and the farther this one got from its forecast date the more they worried about distance from predicted location. The atmoshields were built to take the waves, but were not so well constructed as to be immune to lava explosions. (If she thought about it, Exelle had to admit that the hotel probably wouldn\u2019t survive a direct hit either, but it would do better with a close miss).\nFrom the due date on Linsed insisted on sleeping at the atmoshield with his classmates.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to miss it if it happens at night,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially if it happens at night.\u201d Everyone was hoping for a nighttime event; the first lava flows were apparently the most spectacular, and of course they were more visible in the darkness. But Exelle still preferred the hotel. Every tremor in the atmoshield or hotel float, whether caused by seismic activity or by an ocean swell, sent adrenaline clutching through her gut.\nIt happened during the day, although at least late enough that the swollen sun was no longer directly overhead. There was a rumble, a huge rumble, so much bigger than the previous tremors that Exelle thought it must be qualitatively different, she thought: they were wrong, it isn\u2019t a rupture, it is THE rupture, the planet is about to fly into pieces and be sucked into the sun. I\u2019m going to die here. Everyone around her stood up, there was an excited crescendo of murmurs, and Exelle tried to read in their eyes whether it was all anticipation or whether some of them, too, feared for their lives. But then, off to their east against a sky that was already darkening, after an extra, portentious shudder, the sky was split by red fire. It spun up into the air, twisting and spiring, a pyrotechnic wall. Exelle watched it, her breath still coming short and quick with fear. When the barge shook again she grabbed Linsed\u2019s arm, startled, and he grabbed back and pulled her to him and kissed her, and she felt the dissociation of wondering how anyone could think a rupture signaling the end of a planet was romantic while at the same time picturing their silhouette against that scintillating background. This is something living people shouldn\u2019t see, she thought, the planet is dying, without support systems everyone would be dead by now, people aren\u2019t supposed to survive this. But for the moment, at least, they had.\nThe eruptions went on for days, and it was only then that the party really started to make sense to Exelle. The biggest musicians only came in once the rupture began, the most famous artists, the greatest circus acts. There was one band that only played songs about the end of the world; there were fire-eaters who lit their torches with lava brought in fresh from the rupture; there were fortune-tellers (none of the predictions she heard, Exelle noted, included a long life) and acrobats. On the other hand, everything became more crowded and expensive, now that it was relatively safe, and she felt absurdly glad that she experienced the pre-rupture days, even if she didn\u2019t fully enjoy them. She also felt okay with going back to Xinsibirsk and getting back to work, and she was happy she could finally stop lying to her mother about where she was. She waited a couple of weeks to break up with Linsed, not wanting him to think it was because of the rupture, because that seemed silly. There were only a few cycles before she went home anyway.\nThe night before she left, Starfish and Ybor took her to a Japanese restaurant. Japan had, of course, been submerged for centuries. The owner of the restaurant, a man of Japanese descent, had been born in Inner San Francisco, leaving as an infant only a few months before it, too, was destroyed. He came to their table before the meal, while they were nibbling on yuzu-walnut bread rolls, to tell them about how he had revived old family recipes through a combination of genetic engineering and chemical manipulation to replace ingredients that no longer existed, on Earth or anywhere else. Exelle wished she could take a roll back to Sebrang for Saiwai to taste. She wished she could take the whole meal. Or bring Saiwai here, just to taste it once, just to understand what her ancestors had eaten.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you\u2019re leaving now,\u201d Ybor said. A new prediction had come out of a rupture that was scheduled to happen in the middle of what had once been North America, and everyone was excited because there hadn\u2019t been a rupture on land in almost a century. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t stay a little longer?\u201d\n\u201cI really can\u2019t,\u201d Exelle lied. A land rupture! That would probably be what finally destroyed the planet. Then she asked them what she had asked all of her informants. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave?\u201d\nThey just looked at her, not understanding the sudden change of subject.\n\u201cI mean, why don\u2019t you emigrate? You could, you know.\u201d She wished she could take them back with her. She wished fervently, more than anything (in honor of the farewell, she had drunk more than usual) that she could save them.\nYbor shrugged. \u201cMy home is here.\u201d\n\u201cYou could make your home somewhere else,\u201d Exelle said, starting to feel desperate. \u201cYou have no future here. This planet is dying.\u201d\nStarfish was smiling, twisting his cup in his long fingers. \u201cNot yet. Probably not while I\u2019m alive, maybe not even in my children\u2019s lifetimes. And if we go somewhere else, we won\u2019t have the freedoms we have here.\u201d\nIncomprehensible. \u201cWhat do you mean? What freedoms?\u201d\n\u201cTo live the way we want to.\u201d\n\u201cYou can live the way you want on Sebrang, on another planet!\u201d\nYbor tilted his head at her. \u201cCome on. Aren\u2019t you a little like\u2026\u201d he searched for the phrase. \u201cSecond-class citizens?\u201d\nExelle was stunned. She had never in her life thought of herself that way. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that at all, it\u2019s, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\nStarfish leaned forward. \u201cYou are on someone else\u2019s planet, right? You have to live in what\u2019s left, what they don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly, I mean, there are the Accords, and we live\u2026we live just fine\u2026\u201d Was this how they had seen her the whole time?\n\u201cDon\u2019t most people work as servants for the Brangers?\u201d Ybor asked.\n\u201cJust \u2013 some. And they\u2019re not exactly servants, they \u2013\u201d Exelle struggled for words. Did they pity her? Did they actually feel sorry for emigrants? \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with \u2013 the way we live, in fact it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s great, it\u2019s \u2013\u201d She stopped again, catching herself before she said \u2018better.\u2019 It would be rude, and she didn\u2019t think they would believe her anyway.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it,\u201d Starfish said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how I want to live.\u201d\nBriefly, Exelle no longer wanted to take them back with her. As they stumbled back towards the university, Ybor leaned in to her, a little too close and smelling of rediscovered plum wine, to whisper that he had saved his genetic material in the interplanetary gene bank, just in case. Exelle could only shake her head. On Sebrang it had been centuries since cloning was considered anything but futile, and extremely gauche.\nBy the next morning when she said good-bye in front of the spaceport, she was already thinking herself silly. The land rupture would probably be fine, meaning not the end of the world, and it would be amazing to see. And certainly there was something different here on Earth, she wouldn\u2019t call it freedom exactly, but there was something, maybe something about belonging. Or maybe, as the encyclopedia said, living closer to death. She still thought Starfish and Ybor were crazy, but she hugged them both and cried a little once she had already turned away. And she started thinking about coming back. Maybe. Someday. She was starting to have an idea for another research project, one about how Earthlings perceived extraterrestrials. She was pretty sure she could get funding to come back for that. If, of course, Earth survived the land rupture. If Earth survived. For the moment Exelle was just happy that she had.\nIt wasn\u2019t until many dozens of cycles and many terrified, fascinating visits later that Exelle realized that the real danger of her first visit wasn\u2019t immediate death by rupture. No, the risk that first time had been the sly creep of Earth-love into her blood, this twinned urge to leave and pining to return, this addiction that kept her coming back again and again and that might yet prove fatal.\nMalka Older is a writer, humanitarian aid worker, and PhD candidate studying governance and disasters.

They\u2019re unreliable. Deceitful. Unstable. Sickly. Greedy. And no matter how much you might think this one is different, that this time it can work out, it never, ever does.\nI\u2019d grown up hearing all the warnings, all the stories. We even, after The Incident with Aunt Motte, had it written in cobweb hangings all over the mushroom walls. I repeated it gleefully and dolefully and calmly and excitedly and in about eighteen hundred other different ways, and repeated it again when my cousin fell in love with the ballet dancer and when another cousin fell for a Victorian poet.\nUnfortunately, none of those warnings accounted for coffee.\nYes, coffee. I\u2019d fallen in love with the stuff back in the 15th century or so, when my mother had sent me off for a bit of foreign polish in what was then the Crescent Court \u2013 a kingdom of Jinn, Irshi, and other mystical and unsavory types that more or less adjoined the Ottoman Empire, when it felt like being more or less near the earth, of course. (When I was there the court spent most of its time up in the clouds.) The court was renowned not merely for its ability to rise up into the sky at will, but also its shimmering buildings of moonstone and starlight, its quiet fountains of diamond juice and emerald wines, the carpets woven of music and the beds woven from birdsong.\nI didn\u2019t get to experience much of that, of course. What my mother called \u201cforeign polish\u201d turned out to be cleaning magical chamber pots (yes, fairies have those sorts of needs too, and contrary to what you might have heard, it doesn\u2019t all smell like lilacs and roses) and potion bottles and stitching up cobweb and moonlight gowns. The pile of cobweb repairs in particular was so massive I despaired of ever getting through it; I eventually resorted to tricking some spiders into just weaving some more stuff for me and throwing a glamour over it, hoping no one would notice. They didn\u2019t. And no, not because they were all glamoured by some form of fairy hashish. That\u2019s just vicious gossip that came out after someone broke Titania\u2019s nail when she was on some sort of state visit there. No, the real reason, as I found out later, was that cobweb clothes were a new thing for Turkish fairies \u2013 well, new in fairy terms \u2013 just introduced two hundred years earlier, so none of the fairies had learned to tell \u2013 yet \u2013 the difference between real spider webs and spider webs replaced with a bit of spider glamour.\nBut I did get to try out the coffee. It was a new thing, brought in by the fifth daughter of the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter of the Starry Sultan, who was trying to distinguish herself from all of the other little daughters. It didn\u2019t work for her \u2013 fifth daughters have about the same position in the world of faerie as I do, which is to say, none, whoever our mothers are \u2013 but it did work for me. Before I returned \u2013 my mother having realized that cleaning magical chamber pots really was doing nothing for my spellwork or my poetry or even my linguistic skills \u2013 I gathered up every coffee bean and bit of ground coffee I could find and smuggled it back with me. I figured with a single coffee bean I should be able to enchant moonwater to taste like coffee. At least a little bit.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t.\nNo matter what I did, I couldn\u2019t manage to make a single decent cup of coffee in the fairy realms.\nI tried everything. Moonspells. Starspells. An enchanted harp that, once turned on, would. not. stop. singing. (I finally had to turn it over to a mortal palace, though contrary to what you might have heard, the resulting declarations of war were in no way my fault.) Bribing witches. (No, I\u2019m not going to tell you what happened to my hair afterwards.)\nCoffee could just not be made in the fairy realms. Not proper coffee. It had a mortal magic I could just not replicate.\nIt was so frustrating that I had to drown my sorrows in mortal coffee, and a lot of it. (No, not wine. Contrary to what you may have heard, fairy wine doesn\u2019t make you forget anything. Fairy wine just makes the ground not want to be by your feet for a little while, which can be a bit uncomfortable for mortals, especially the mortals who have decided to wander under the hills. Fairy cake, on the other hand \u2013 well, that depends on who is eating the cake, but I have seen some strange things, let me tell you, and I was there for the great Frog Clowns incident, so I know strange.)\nI became an expert. Italian coffee. Turkish coffee \u2013 from small cafes on mortal streets; I had no desire to see those chamber pots for several more centuries, thank you. Egyptian coffee. Spanish coffee. English coffee. Lattes. Espressos. I grew bold. I crossed oceans. Sought out cafes here, cafes there. Luxury hotels serving the finest in Kenyan coffee. Even civet coffee (which, I have to tell you, does not live up to its claim.) I scattered fairy gold everywhere; handed out more leaves glamoured to look like mortal money, and later credit cards, than I care to remember.\nWhich is how I happened to be in that little caf\u00e9, slowly stirring a cappuccino, when she walked in.\nI knew the feeling immediately. Every fairy does. We fall in love faster than humans do, if not always for longer, and given our lifespans \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say that I could spend the next two hours listing the names of those I\u2019ve fallen for, and we\u2019d still need more coffee to get through the list. I told myself this was exactly the same. Brief. Intense. Much like \u2013 I told myself this was a very clever thought \u2013 the taste of a cup of coffee.\nCoffee, I thought. Drink down more coffee.\nUnfortunately, this meant getting up for the coffee \u2013 and standing right next to her as she made her order.\nOk, so, maybe this wasn\u2019t going to be brief.\nI ordered mine. And then \u2013 I\u2019m embarrassed to admit this, but it really happened \u2013 just as I grabbed my coffee, I slipped a little, and spilled some on her.\n(Come to think of it, it\u2019s just possible someone else was in that caf\u00e9 \u2013 my type of person, if you know what I mean. I won\u2019t say I never slip or spill things. It\u2019s just that these days, it\u2019s rare. I might not have gained much grace from my various visits to various courts \u2013 you don\u2019t when you\u2019re working \u2013 but I had learned not to spill things. Getting stuck with a seven-foot-long nose for seventy-seven years kinda teaches you to be careful with liquids.)\nShe in turn jumped back, and spilled her coffee. So with that, I had to go back to the counter and pull out another enchanted leaf to buy two more coffees. Well, two more cappuccinos. (No, I don\u2019t usually carry real money around, especially these days, when in order to get money you usually have to provide various little plastic cards or at least something proving your identity, and nothing, absolutely nothing, is worse for fairies than proof. And the enchanted leaves aren\u2019t quite as worthless as you might think \u2013 just touching one gives a mortal a little jolt of happiness, a little jolt of magic, a little jolt of luck. Which to my mind is a completely fair payment for a single cup of coffee.)\nNaturally, after that, we had to talk.\nWe were still talking when the caf\u00e9 announced that it was closing for the evening.\n\u201cI had no idea it was so late,\u201d I said. That was true; I rarely notice the passage of time.\n\u201cSo much for working,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\u201cWorking?\u201d\nShe\u2019d already slipped her computer into her shoulder bag, but she tapped the bag anyway. \u201cI came here to try to get some more work done on some illustrations.\u201d\n\u201cShow me?\u201d\n\u201cClosed,\u201d repeated one of the caf\u00e9 workers.\nShe grinned. \u201cDay job in the morning. Maybe some other time?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, and felt a touch of magic settle on me.\nI shuddered.\nGo, I told myself. The world had plenty of other cafes, plenty of other small towns, plenty of other places to find a perfect cup of coffee. And I really needed to go see my sisters again. And send messages to my mother.\nInstead, I found myself walking in a small park nearby. The park bordered a little lake, where some water sprites were singing a moon song. I spared a moment of pity for mortals, including the mortal I had just met, most of whom would never hear it, and sat down on a park bench, near a tree that bent a single branch to touch me on the shoulder.\nI meant to leave, I really did. But that park bench was so comfortable, and in the morning, the water sprites wanted to gossip. Of course. I\u2019ve never met a water sprite who didn\u2019t. And then it was time for lunch \u2013 gossip makes me hungry \u2013 and I spied a little bookshop that needed a visit and a touch of glamour, and then I realized I needed more coffee.\nNaturally, she was already there, computer open, coffee in hand.\nThat was how it began.\nWe talked about books. Politics. History. Trees. Books again. She ranted about her day job. I could almost feel the magic leeching from my bones. I changed the subject. She ranted about it again.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do this instead?\u201d I asked, gesturing towards the computer.\n\u201cNot good enough.\u201d\n\u201cShow me.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on. You\u2019ve been promising for \u2013 how long now?\u201d\nWeeks, but I didn\u2019t want to think about that.\n\u201cOk,\u201d she said, making a few clicks, and turning the screen towards me. I carefully put my hands behind my back.\n\u201cYou can click through,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI fry anything electronic when I get near it,\u201d I said. And I do, although that\u2019s less me, and fairies in general. Our kind is notoriously terrible with electronics, and I\u2019m worse than most. Just passing within two feet of one can give it what you mortals call the blue screen of death. And yes, now you know where that comes from, but try telling that to whoever is handling your warranty or tech support. \u201cYou do it.\u201d\n\u201cOk,\u201d she said, with a few more clicks.\nDragons.\nNot realistic ones, mind you, but humans never get dragons right. The important thing was, they were dragons, and they glowed against her screen. A picture of what mortals think is a fairy looking up at the moon. A few pictures of bears. A squirrel. A girl reading books.\n\u201cThese are really good,\u201d I told her. And they were.\n\u201cNah,\u201d she said. A look of frustration came over her face. \u201cI mean, they could be. They\u2019re just not there yet.\u201d\n\u201cThey are good,\u201d I said.\nI was using mortal standards, of course, nothing up to ours, but by those standards, it was good.\n\u201cSeriously, you should think about showing them someplace.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cMaybe. One day. It\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re magical yet. Does that make any sense?\u201d\nA shudder ran through my body.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I just need some more art classes or something.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe you just need a little magic,\u201d I said.\nI was tempted. I was really tempted. But all of those rules flashed through my head, and instead of pulling out an enchanted leaf, I pulled a leaf out of her ear.\n\u201cHa,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHa,\u201d I said back.\nAnd then we were back to talking about books again.\nI made up stories about various mortal girlfriends. She told me about everywhere she had been: Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia. I countered with some false \u2013 and true \u2013 travel stories of my own. (Our experiences of Rome were, shall we say, very different.) She shared her music with me \u2013 or at least thought she did. I\u2019m even worse with those so called flash drive things, or CDs; they melt away in my hands. But a bit of glamour took care of that, and I let her play some stuff for me through her laptop, though she had to keep apologizing for the terrible sound quality. (It really was terrible: apart from the cheap computer speakers, the playback was also fighting with just having me nearby.)\nI\u2019d never met a mortal easier to talk to. Never. Never felt so comfortable with a mortal. Ever. That very strangeness \u2013 not that it felt strange at all \u2013 was probably why I missed it, probably how I missed the moment when things became too right, too comfortable. It wasn\u2019t just a touch of fairy love, or enchantment, not any more.\nI had to stop it.\nI smiled at her, raised my caf\u00e9 latte, and stretched out my legs. \u201cYou know what we should do sometime?\u201d\nHer eyes narrowed a bit. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever used the words \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cdo\u201d in a sentence before. \u201cNo, what?\u201d\n\u201cGo out for dinner. And then \u2013 I dunno. A concert. A walk. You know, like a date.\u201d\nHer eyes looked down.\n\u201cOh, Andre,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 I should have said something before this, but I figured you\u2019d already guessed.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re with someone,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2013 I bat for the other team.\u201d\nIt took me awhile. Then I looked down at myself, and remembered.\nMy fingers twitched.\nI could have made her forget all that, made her forget who she was. I could have said one of those foolish things that my kind often says to humans when we cannot stop thinking about them. I could have ranted about human gender standards (it\u2019s always tempting.) I could have told her that in my time I have loved both mortal men and mortal women, and been loved by both. I could have told her that none of that mattered.\nDon\u2019t fall in love with mortals.\nI could have fed her fairy cake.\nInstead, I bent over and kissed her cheek. \u201cSucks to be a guy sometimes,\u201d I said lightly. \u201cCan I get you another cup of coffee?\u201d\nShe shook her head.\nI smiled, because mortals smile at times like that, when they are trying to be brave, or at least trying not to cry.\nI smiled, because fairies can\u2019t cry in front of mortals, because the tears of a fairy can bring true love, and that, in the wrong time and place, can be deadly indeed.\nI smiled, dropped a leaf in her coffee, and left.\nAt least you won\u2019t have to watch her die, I told myself.\nThe next coffee I had was too bitter to drink, though at least, at the end, I had plenty of fairy tears.\nI saw her five years later.\nShe was at one of those comic book conventions. Yes, fairies go to those all the time \u2013 especially now, when certain Exalted People \u2013 I can\u2019t name names, you understand \u2013 want to know exactly what mortals know about us, or think they know about us, or are completely making up about us. Not that I was there for the usual spying, or even to find some art to enchant. Just for a bit of distraction.\nShe was there in line, getting coffee.\nI fell \u2013 yes, me, the fairy trained in about a hundred fairy courts (sometimes it feels like a thousand) \u2013 flat on the floor. When I sat up \u2013 thanks largely to what seemed like fifty mortal hands, all coated in painful metal \u2013 she was still there. I took a closer look.\nIt wasn\u2019t a spell, or a glamour.\nI took deep breaths. That used to be more of a mortal trick, but we\u2019ve picked up a few things from you. Then I pushed away all of those helpful hands saying I just needed some air. And to get away from all that metal; if you ask me, the worst invention ever made by mortals was the metal bracelet, followed by the wristwatch, ducking behind a wall. And then \u2013\nGlamour.\nA touch to hide myself from mortals. Another touch to heal my skin. And then I pulled out the little bottle of tears.\nI was weak-kneed when it was done.\nCoffee.\nIf she had given up, or already gotten her coffee \u2013\nBut she hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cSlow line?\u201d I said, as I walked up, trying not to fall over.\nIt was easy, so easy, to talk to her. So easy to laugh. I forgot that she wasn\u2019t a long term crony, forgot that she had already broken my heart, forgot that what I\u2019d just done wasn\u2019t exactly the sort of thing guaranteed to win a woman\u2019s heart. Instead I talked. And listened. She was there, she explained, to sell the first of her fantasy prints. I insisted on going and seeing them. She told me not to bother, that they were just early efforts. I went anyway.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, laughing, waving my hands. \u201cI\u2019ll check out your prints when they\u2019re done. I fry electronics when they get near me.\u201d\nHer face darkened.\n\u201cSomething I said?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cOnly \u2013 what you just said. Kinda reminded me of someone I once knew.\u201d\nI tilted my head just slightly and let a little frown appear on my face. \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cOh, no.\u201d She grinned at me. \u201cIn any case, I kinda bat for the other side.\u201d\nThis time I let a larger grin appear on my face, as I tried very hard not to scratch at my bra. (Why do humans insist on wearing these things?) \u201cMe too,\u201d I said. I ostentatiously looked at my wrist and the watch that wasn\u2019t actually on there, but which I\u2019d glamoured up hours before. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d\n\u201cIt was really nice to meet you,\u201d she said. The sort of things mortals always say, but something told me she might actually mean it.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. I swallowed. I usually wasn\u2019t this nervous with this kind of thing. This bad at it. And when I have been, it\u2019s been easy enough to say goodbye. To move on to something that felt less comfortable. Less right. I opened up my mouth to say goodbye.\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay in touch,\u201d I told her, tipping my fedora to her, and dropping a leaf by her coffee. A mostly unglamoured leaf. Nothing that would make her want to call me, nothing that would make her dream of me. But a leaf that looked suspiciously like a small piece of paper which just happened to have my number on it.\n(Ok, well, specifically, a set of numbers that if she dialed while thinking of me would connect her phone to a tree that I use to take my messages, and yes, it cost me more in fairy gold than I want to think about, but compared to the cost of getting a cell phone every other day it was nothing, not to mention that trees tend to ask a lot fewer questions than mortal phone companies.)\nAnd after I dropped it, I bent over, to make sure she could get a good look.\nAs I walked off, I could feel her reach for it, feel her staring at the numbers, feel her widening grin. And suddenly that bra didn\u2019t seem to itch that much.\nI had no idea how to tell her that. Or what she would say if I did.\nSomeday, I thought, someday I might just tell you what it was like to meet you, when I was mostly a man.\nYes, it was going to go badly. Yes, we were both going to get hurt. One, or both of us, might even end up bound up in a tree for a hundred years, or desperately and futilely in love with the depths of the ocean, or obsessed with making fine clothes from rough nettles. I had no idea how to tell her any of it, if I could ever tell her any of it. And yes, I was probably going to have to watch her die, knowing that no fairy could help her. But for now, it was magical, and it was enough. And with a twitch of my fingers, I glamoured up a few leaves to buy a mortal coffee maker. Never lose what started the magic, my mother always said, and I wasn\u2019t about to stop now.\nMari Ness is just a little bit obsessed with coffee. Just a little bit.

He left nearly everything else behind, keeping two pairs of Levi\u2019s 513s, and an enormous green parka from the Korean War. Three pairs of socks. More than that, Gabe reasoned, was extravagance for someone in his position. He might one day have to eliminate even these terminal luxuries, reducing his belongings to one suit of clothes and the Collected Martinus, carried through the city in his kit bag. But not quite yet, and while he had an office he could still afford to change his socks.\nAt first he walked barefoot to save his boots. He ate abandoned ham sandwiches, nicked leftovers from on-campus receptions. He tied his lengthening hair with string. In October he remembered that in the interests of weightlessness he had left his winter gloves on the sidewalk out behind the house on Amelia Street, so he cut strips off his towel and wrapped his hands for the cold walk from the Computation building to the English Graduate Reading Room and back again. He spent his days pouring over the punch cards and spreadsheets that should, one day, soon, eventually become the Index Arethusa, a statistical analysis of Martinus\u2019s final long poem of 1833, Arethusa.\nHe knew the project was revolutionary in both English and Computation, so he almost didn\u2019t mind that people avoided him. For that reason he chose to work at night, and share the empty buildings only with the Professor of Fluidic Logic, who had a basement office near his. Gabe only ever saw him at the end of a hallway, or slipping out of the common room as Gabe opened the door. Everyone knew Dr Leukos was a crank whose obstinate pursuit of analogue technology implied Soviet sympathies. It was fine, Gabe had reasoned, to be avoided by a crank when one is a revolutionary.\nFor five years his research had accumulated on spreadsheets and punch cards. Their susurrations and the dry wheeze of the department\u2019s processors were \u2013 he often thought \u2013 the sound of his argument, the sound of words in an infinite shuffle, every syllable of those 4135 lines of poetry counted, classified, re-ordered by his instructions to reveal the profound and invisible orders that govern poetry itself.\nAnd you, Arethusa, he murmured through the halls of the night-time university, listening for the sound his dissertation made, who in your courses limn the ocean deeps, the worlds below, O wellspring, Nereid-limbed.\nHe had read those lines for the first time on an afternoon in September of his first year at university. 1964. The Norton Anthology of English Literature open to page 371, and there was Arethusa, sudden like a rainstorm or a revealed truth. It wasn\u2019t just the words, either, it was something behind them, elemental, something like the trickle and brim, like full ditches draining the woodland in April, or the palmate route a stream will cut across the beach and into the tideline. Something he called Arethusa because there was no other word for it, O wellspring, Nereid-limbed. The startle, awakening to the scent of water in his basement office.\nHe sensed it before he heard it, something moving behind the walls, first audible only at night, then constant when he knew to hold his breath and listen.\nOnce he woke past three in the morning with a bladder that felt as large and rigid as a basketball. On his way back from the men\u2019s room he stopped in an otherwise un-remarkable length of wall to rest his fingertips against the plaster, where he sensed the faint, liquid rush. Not the sound of settling foundations, nor a distant janitor shuffling his mop down a mud-printed hallway on the second floor. Something more fundamental, like blood rushing his eardrums.\nThat was the week he found himself annoyed at those creatures who only dwelt in the building by day, who never listened, nor padded the long corridor to the men\u2019s room as he did, to hear the water prattling through the drains as he brushed his teeth, and after that a sound so faint it might be the interior of his own body, rendered audible by the silence around him.\nHe slept in the Korean War parka. By November it smelled, a second skin of always-slightly-damp cotton, like a tent overwintered in the rafters of a garage. But the smell didn\u2019t matter because at the other end of his season underground, the programming complete, he would uncover Arethusa\u2019s secrets. The inaugural argument of a new era, where literary study would be the management of data: its hidden currents and laws; the substraits of meaning that we readers sense, but cannot know. A painless, linguistic vivisection, Arethusa laid bare from text to subtext, down to quanta of literary significance, of relationships imperceptible without inhuman statistical insight.\nBy January the strips around his fingers frayed so badly he cut another quarter of his towel to replace them.\nOfficially, Gabe met the Professor of Fluidic Logic (the one with Soviet sympathies) early on a Sunday morning in March. It was nearly Spring outside, but the basement remained wintry. Wintry like Jonathan Martinus in his last weeks, fleeing his creditors in Glasgow and starving in a boarding house as he scratched the last words of Arethusa cross-wise over the poem\u2019s first pages. A textual ouroboros, Gabe called it, as the end overtook the beginning in a secret instruction to readers, a reminder that the poem \u2013 like the hydrosphere itself \u2013 never ceases its cycle. That was from the introduction.\nOn his way back from the men\u2019s room he stopped to listen for the rush. It was obliterated by the crash of metal on stone. He followed the sound, and around the corner he saw that Dr. Leukos stood before a doorway, an acetylene torch under his arm, masses of pipe around his feet.\n\u201cDr Leukos?\u201d Gabe picked up the pipes.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cOh.\u201d Then he unlocked the door and led Gabe into a service corridor that ran the length of the building, twenty feet wide in some places, and filled with ducts and bundled wires, abandoned furniture and buckets and mops, very dark, then weakly lit. Dr. Leukos led him among the pipes toward another doorway, then a workbench, a broken easy chair in red velvet, a lamp with a pink glass shade. More important than all that, though, was the long wall opposite the door, which held an enormous aquarium, filled with glass and Lucite pipes and gates and tanks. At the bench Dr Leukos fussed with the copper pipes, and set the acetylene with other canisters on the workbench.\n\u201cA Philips machine?\u201d Gabe asked.\nDr Leukos grunted and for a moment they admired the network of transparent acrylic tubes through which water rippled with a faint, rushing music. Many of the system\u2019s components disappeared through the walls, through holes cut raggedly in wood, and plaster. Someone \u2013 Dr Leukos, he guessed \u2013 had chipped a messy trench in the terrazzo through which the copper snaked.\n\u201cHow big is it?\u201d\nDr. Leukos grunted. He looked up from the bench and said in his sharply accented English, \u201cBig.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2013 \u201d\n\u201c\u2013of course not. What\u2019s your name? And why are you always here in the night? I have heard you and had to go the other way.\u201d\nGabe introduced himself, and explained about the Index Arethusa and the emergent field of Literary Calculation, but Dr. Leukos never left his workbench, nor looked up. When Gabe finished, Dr. Leukos grunted again, and then lit the Acetylene torch and made some adjustment that sent sparks flooding the workbench. He didn\u2019t wear a mask. Gabe waited, his face averted, watching shadows scattered by Dr Leukos\u2019s water integrator.\n\u201cYou will help me carry these.\u201d Dr Leukos said, \u201cI need them installed while the others are gone, or they will complain about the noise I make. They are always complaining, so I must work at night.\u201d\nGabe followed Dr. Leukos back out to the corridor, and then so far along it he wondered if they\u2019d passed the building\u2019s foundations, and now crept beneath the quadrangle outside. They left through another of the service doors which Gabe had often seen, but never noticed, and then another door, and a corridor, this one full of transparent pipes lit by an internal luminescence like sea-water in summer.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gabe asked. \u201cWhy does it glow?\u201d\n\u201cDinoflagellates,\u201d Dr Leukos said. \u201cPyrocystis Fusiformis.\u201d Gabe thought of night swimming in black water, out of reach of the shore, and blue-green light haloing their limbs. Bright rings of water around them in the dark sudden, irrefutable evidence of the microscopic universe.\n\u201cBut why?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Dr Leukos answered, his voice temporarily and uncharacteristically mild. \u201cAnd I miss the ocean.\u201d\nHe tapped the Lucite overhead with one finger and Gabe thought he saw the light ripple, as though responsive, and a sympathetic glow illuminate Dr Leukos skin. But perhaps it was only his nighttime eyes: when he blinked it was gone.\nAfter that night Gabe often followed the glow of Pyrocystis Fusiformis along the service corridor to Dr Leukos\u2019s workshop. Dr Leukos wasn\u2019t welcoming, but eventually the man let him help, and he carried armfuls of copper pipes, and was even allowed to touch the Lucite logic gates.\nGabe was happy for the respite from his own work. Gabe\u2019s problem \u2013 or, one of them \u2013 during those weeks was that Arethusa disintegrated into ever-smaller units as he dissected it, and the connections between them proliferated in ways he had not foreseen, so the Index Arethusa grew exponentially with each day\u2019s work. He had set out to prove what he had always sensed: that there was a quantum of meaning in poetry, particularly in Arethusa that lay not in the obvious narrative, but in the relationship between words, in the deictic particles that bound thought to thought, that mapped Martinus\u2019s intellectual landscape, even while it told the story of a Nereid, a minor Arcadian god, and a secret river that runs beneath the Mediterranean. Such a reading was beyond statistics.\nOne late night Gabe was sitting on a toilet staring at the men\u2019s room floor, thinking about pronouns, and the proximal and distal relationships of this and that, or these and those as Martinus used them in the third Canto. He fell asleep for a moment, his head near his knees, and when his eyes opened he was staring hard at the drain in the middle of the floor. It was covered with a metal grill, patinated to brown. Behind it lay darkness.\nOr not \u2013 darkness that gleamed with the flat, unnatural light of the fluorescent tubes in the ceiling. On the other side of the grill water trickled. A rill, a beck, a single rapid winking up at him in the light of a 3am basement bathroom.\nGabe flushed. He washed his hands. He listened to the white rush of the water around him. He thought of his own body constituted in water, and the effluent that flowed from him \u2013 even now \u2013 and from the city. There was rainfall in the province\u2019s hinterlands that rushed toward him and away along ancient waterways, that had preexisted the city and which \u2013 encountering its concrete, its water-greedy suburban greenbelts \u2013 flowed through and around but never stopped, only paused, and tumbled on. There were the named rivers and their valleys, the Humber and the Don: racing \/ After, onward, then, to Ortygia\u2019s \/ Holier shore, where sleeps my Arethusa.\nA vast network in place, and toward which the Leukos Machine already crept, even if Leukos didn\u2019t admit it was so. The first hint of a system so complex it might, Gabe thought, be adequate to the work of representing Arethusa, the well-spring, the Nereid-limbed. For a moment he sensed it, the slight, the tenuous channels that water will cut through anything that bars its way.\nGabe had cultivated the monomaniacal perspective of the basement-dwelling graduate student, so it was easy to imagine a hydrospheric world-computer as vast as the index he had imagined. He reasoned that Dr Leukos had already begun it in the walls of the very building in which he sat, in the substance which he had drunk, and eliminated, and flushed away; in the city\u2019s systems, its flora, the tender roots of grass, and the deep roots of black walnut and red oak, the nodes, the connections, the reservoirs in winter-dormant perennials, the memory of trees. His mind rushed outward through campus greenspace and city parks, the culverts and storm drains, the ravines.\nHe had learned that the ideas that came to him in the middle of the night were best kept to himself. It was one of those weekends, when even Dr Leukos stayed away, when it was early on a Sunday morning, those days which were very long and \u2013 having the place to himself \u2013 he wandered, listening to Arethusa\u2019s calculations course the walls.\nA month later Gabe sat on the floor of the workshop, using one of Dr Leukos\u2019s diagrams and building a \u0141ukasiewicz logic gate from acrylic components, assembled in the jig that he had designed (Dr Leukos hadn\u2019t noticed this innovation, but Gabe thought he would appreciate it). He was waiting for the solvent cement to set on the last round, before he\u2019d test its joins, and add it to the pile he had already made, the components labeled and boxed and then \u2013 one of the nights when he was unwelcome in the lab, when Dr Leukos did the meticulous and arcane work, they would be deployed.\n\u201cDo you ever think, Dr Leukos, of what would happen if you flipped a switch? Or. No. A nozzle. A duct. If you turned a tap?\u201d\nDr Leukos looked up from his diagram.\n\u201cDo you ever want to open a valve and let it out into the. The.\u201d Gabe searched for a word that would describe the thing which he had glimpsed through the drain in the men\u2019s room, the hydrospheric computer composed of all the conduits water might take \u2013 animal, vegetable, mechanical or geological \u2013 and the rationales of its flow. He held the gate in his hands as it fused into a translucent mass of curves, reservoirs and cloaca. The word that came into his head was ridiculous, but still he said it: \u201cInto the plumbing?\u201d What he meant to say was, out of the secret river and into the open but he thought Dr Leukos would have a better grasp of plumbing.\n\u201cThe plumbing.\u201d Dr Leukos said. He joined Gabe on the floor, squatted near the pile of components. \u201cFlipping a switch, as you put it dear Gabriel, would only do something if the water were the computer. The water is not the computer.\u201d He held up an acrylic elbow joint. \u201cNo more than the territory is the map. The water alights, temporarily, within our closed system, and we use what we know about its behaviour to model another quite different system. One would think that a man so well educated in literature would understand analogies.\u201d\nGabe set the finished gate on the floor beside all the others. Dr. Leukos stood. He was smiling in a kind way that suggested he had discovered something important about Gabe\u2019s nature. Perhaps that he was an idiot.\nHe wondered if the problem with the Computation Centre was an inability to reckon with poetry. Perhaps, he thought, perhaps water only consented to complete Dr Leukos\u2019s assigned tasks, as Gabe consented to build logic gates and carry copper pipes to the dusty reaches of a service corridor. Perhaps they should have more respect for the water.\nJonathan Martinus understood, Gabe thought. We should be grateful to the element that constitutes us, and on which we depend. Water is generous. Water is irresistible.\n\u201cShe needs a name, a real name.\u201d\nDr Leukos indulged one of his intentionally-awkward silences, and when he spoke his voice was very, very dry. \u201cI do not find it necessary,\u201d then he paused, and Gabe was pretty sure he was taking the piss when he added: \u201cPerhaps Leukos Machine Mk. 3.\u201d\n\u201cArethusa,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cHer name is Arethusa.\u201d\nThe thunder ricochets down the shallow river valleys that run on either side of the city. The rivers \u2013 one is called Don and the other Humber \u2013 have no associated gods, as far as anyone in Toronto knows. They can still hear something like divine wrath rattle up-country.\nThen the first collection of raindrops, like cat\u2019s paws batting at heads, winkling through the fine wool of summer suits and soaking dresses to the skin. Men hold newspapers over their heads, and women run to save their sandals. And the students on the quadrangle flee for the Library\u2019s atrium with their guitars for an impromptu, interminable folk-sing, bass provided by the rumble and drench outside. All over the city the squirrels soaked in five minutes, the crows in less, the little starlings, and the sleeping raccoons, the pigeons flee for their roosts in the girdered overpasses. The street cats satched, and the old retriever tied to the railing outside the bar endures with Christian patience the bathwater runnels in which he sits, scenting the air with wet dog. A girl in a long dress crouches on the step of her row-house, ringing out her skirt and unaware that the water has crept into her basement apartment and saturated the green shag carpeting, and now climbs upward, wicking through the stack of journals she has kept since she was twelve, and destroying the blue sateen suit she meant to wear tonight.\nIn the high country the waters do not abate. The ravines flood, and the highways that follow them to the lake shore.\nThe first collection of raindrops is an irritation. The second is remarkable. The third is frightening. In the beginning people hide under awnings, out of reach of sudden rivers, and cling to the still-warm and spattered brickwork. It can\u2019t last, they think, and look up through the curtaining rain to the sky \u2013 bruise-black to the north, and thunder-green over the lake. Just wait it out, let the water run past them through the dry stream-beds of streets, through the basements and corridors, subway tunnels and ductwork through which the waters rush with their burden of garbage, first the body of a mouse, then a rat. A man on the twentieth floor of a glass building is troubled by the water-blackened sky, and wonders if the flood will rise forever, claiming corridor after corridor until the whole world is drowned.\nOn the afternoon of the high country flood Gabe had succeeded in modeling fifteen lines of Arethusa, using Dr Leukos\u2019s theory and his own research. Perhaps Dr Leukos had noticed the proliferation of acrylic and copper in the service corridor. Perhaps he had heard Gabe\u2019s recitation as he worked:\nFrom well and earth she springs again\nTo open sky, a mingled creature. Wild\nStone-daughter, root-child, of fallen petals\nAnd all the fair ones born. And I pursuant,\nArethusa, to far shores, and seas unknown\nOr perhaps not. Perhaps no one heard Gabe.\nThe lines \u2013 first parsed, then lemmatized, then translated into gates and junctures analogous to networks of meaning: the deictic play of prepositions, the relationship of shore to sea, between petal and spring, the cistern-stanzas, the channeling verbs that ran out like water from the page to his mind and conjured in language and Lucite his own mingled creature. Arethusa, Nereid-limbed, who fled from him through the service corridors and ducts of the Computation Centre\u2019s sub-basements, but who he conjured into being with the principles of the Leukos Machine.\nAnd then a rill crept over the grey terrazzo, revealing as it passed the sudden, miraculous depth that wet stone possesses. It was not the gleam Gabe noticed first, nor his wet socks, but the room\u2019s sudden freshness. The water collected against the arch of his foot, and finally he looked up at the door, where the water ran toward him, revealing an otherwise-invisible slope to the building\u2019s foundation.\nHe finished the sentence he had begun dissecting before the rill nuzzled his foot: And far thy \/ Murmuring waters run from glacial \/ Fell and lowland fen, toward the richer \/deeps. He watched the tiny flood, and thought of the vast, analogous network he had glimpsed, and toward which he groped with each newly constructed gate and reservoir. The rill \u2013 which he found he already called Arethusa \u2013 reached the far wall under the desk, then another tendril slipped under the door, over the lip of his sill, and another, and another crept toward him.\nHe had just thought of Dr Leukos alone in the workshop when the lights went out. The darkness was startling in its warmth, the deep, stony scent of it, and \u2013 even through the earth and the building\u2019s walls \u2013 the shudder of far-away thunder.\nIn the hallway the water covered his toes, then wet the threads that hung down from his frayed jeans. He walked upstream, the current warm as bathwater, coloured like creekwater, as though it had passed through streambeds and pastures, among roots and stones that had stained it faintly amber before it reached his grey stone basement. The air roared, and the staircase at the end of the hall was a waterfall, the doors at the bottom blown open by Arethusa.\nThe service corridor was downstream, and he felt his way along the walls through which the amber water ran, illuminated by the faint light of Pyrocystis Fusiformis, so he followed Arethusa\u2019s deep sea gleam to the workshop. It was then, he thought afterward, that some barrier up above must have broken, some culvert jammed, because as he opened the door the water eddied and rose to his knees. He shouted \u201cDr Leukos? Are you there?\u201d\nArethusa the Nereid-limbed lit the room around her. Her mutable form fixed \u2013 unnaturally \u2013 by acrylic and copper, glass and steel. The scent of water. Then the flood to mid-thigh. To his hips, climbing up along his spine.\nThe darkness limned only by Arethusa, the multiform, the protean. The water up to his waist,\nFlip the valve, he thought. Let her out. Let her in.\nAnd when he smashed the first of the glass reservoirs the room filled with her oceanic glow, the colour of nightswimming, he thought, as his face brushed the exposed beams of the ceiling. And I pursuant were the last of his words, as the water filled his mouth, and his thin, seeping blood joined the hydrospheric computer he had imagined. Gabe was a weak sort of river-god, lord of a small portion. He felt again the stab of his first reading, the sympathetic surge of blood in his heart as she spilled through him.\nHis forehead pressed to the ceiling, then under the rising water. He pushed off the floor, and clung to the bare beams, the water pushed at his closed mouth, and bubbled in to his ears, and then down his throat. It was warm, but then came the panic, and then the burn, and the struggle for breath he had not expected as Arethusa poured into his lungs and filled him to the brim with a faint, green, glow.\nThe white gate. The luminous glance. Then darkness absolute.\nGabe threw up, a hot slurry down his chest. When he opened his eyes he saw Dr Leukos, the old man with the ragged face leaning over him in the hallway, the water still running past them down to a sub-basement. Dr Leukos \u2013 his thin white hair plastered to his scalp \u2013 around them there were floating punch cards, an office chair, paper cups and reams of paper.\nHe struggled to sit up. Dr Leukos shushed him, \u201cGabriel, you should be careful\u2013\u201d\nGabe wanted to say, no, I didn\u2019t drown but found he couldn\u2019t speak, only cough and wretch. There was light around them, a blue-green glow: Arethusa, familiar, lighting the receding waters of the basement.\nIt was more than the water. It was the old man\u2019s skin as well, his eyes, shedding light, though Dr Leukos hid his face in his hands. Then said to Gabe, who could not answer: \u201cPyrocystis Fusiformis, or so I have called it. I am told, though, they should not flourish so in blood, so perhaps not. It should perhaps have another name\u2013 you might call it Arethusa. I am sorry, dear Gabriel. I think I should have warned you. But perhaps it was already too late.\u201d\nSomewhere the upcountry flood abated, left the city in a faint, blue-green shimmer, lost \u2013 for now \u2013 in the lake\u2019s darkness.\nAfter the paramedics and the hospital. After recovery, a stern conversation with his twin supervisors, with the heads of departments and the deans. A scramble to salvage something from the water, the paper-mash that remained of his research. A perfunctory and awkward defence: questions about database design and the zeugmatic constructions in the third Canto, Gabe\u2019s debt to Roberto Busa, Martinus\u2019s debt to Cowper.\nPass.\nAt the end of the summer Gabe returned to his office for the Collected Martinus. He left the Korean war parka in a garbage can.\nDr Leukos didn\u2019t knock. \u201cGabriel,\u201d he said from the doorway, \u201cYou are finished now. You will leave us.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Gabe said. Dr Leukos waited another moment. Gabe wanted to know about the acetylene the old man carried, about the bulging pockets of his jacket, but Dr Leukos did not volunteer, and Gabe did not ask.\n\u201cYou are happy with the outcome. You are content,\u201d Dr Leukos said.\nDuring his defence Gabe had heard her: the rush across his eardrums, had known that if it was dark he, too, would have possessed the faint luminosity of the deep.\nHe wanted to tell Dr Leukos that, but said instead, \u201cit was okay. They asked the wrong questions. But it\u2019s done now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Dear Gabriel. Yes.\u201d\nHe held out his hand and Gabe shook it. It was wet \u2013 not with sweat, Gabe thought. With floodwaters, he thought, and under his skin, with Arethusa herself.\nDr Leukos left. When Gabe shut his office door behind him he followed the old man\u2019s watery footprints, past the walls where, even now, Arethusa might be reconstituting herself.\nRebecca Campbell is a Canadian writer and academic.
