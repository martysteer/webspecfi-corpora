Each cell contained a glass cubicle, a control desk, an operator, a clock. Perhaps, as with McDonalds restaurants, this was designed to project a proprietary image (the technology was new, and Instransit held a patent monopoly). More likely it was to soothe the nerves of jittery passengers, who would have no clue from their surroundings of the moment their journey began and ended (there were no flashing lights, no noise). The only change most passengers noticed at that moment was in the operator - and on longer journeys, the clock.\nMark Heydon was watching the operator of cell 25, expecting her to turn into a Singaporean at any moment. Instead, she continued to stab determinedly at the keys of her console. Judging from her expression, the satellite link to Singapore was down - or there was an electrical storm, or a strike, or some other equally familiar calamity. He was waiting for the first transmat fatality, and then he swore he would revert to plane travel. At least planes had in-flight entertainment to relieve the boredom.\nHeydon noticed that he had been staring at the operator too hard - she was staring back at him, with an odd expression on her face. He averted his eyes quickly. Then, puzzled, he looked back up. She wasn't simply staring at him - she was terrified.\n\"What's wrong?\", he asked, somewhat startled. \"You look like you've seen a ghost.\" The operator made no reply - perhaps she hadn't heard him through the glass. She fumbled in her desk drawer with trembling hands, her eyes glazed with fear. \"Look,\" he continued a little louder, \"if there's a problem with the transmat, I'm not in such a hurry; I'll come back...\"\nThen the cubicle shattered. As glass hailed down around him, Heydon saw a gun. He saw the operator's quivering finger close on the trigger again. The wall behind him exploded. Heydon dove to the floor.\n\"What the hell are you doing!\" Heydon scrambled behind the desk as she fired again. For a moment, the desk separating them, Heydon's wild panting was the only sound. He scanned the room for a weapon. There was nothing: transmat terminals were all the same.\nThe silence was broken; not by a shot, but a voice. \"Stand up\", the operator pleaded desperately, \"I won't hurt you if you give yourself up quietly.\"\n\"Give myself up!\", Heydon squealed, \"I'm a bloody computer technician! What am I supposed to have done?\"\n\"Stand up!\" He stood. The operator stared at him through streaming eyes, her back pressed against the wall. She clasped the gun in front of her with both hands. Then she began to pull the trigger.\nIn a panic, Heydon dropped behind the desk again. The operator instinctively followed his movement with the gun as she fired, and the bullet shattered the surface of the control desk, sending a shower of sparks and acrid smoke into her face. Heydon vaulted over the desk and kicked the gun from her hands, tripping himself over as he did so. Hysterical, the operator threw herself upon him, grasping his neck with an iron grip. Heydon began to choke. His arms flailing, he latched his hands onto her neck and squeezed back with all the strength he retained.\nFor an agonising minute the pair convulsed on the floor, all the more brutal to the other the more pain they endured. The operator kicked away from the side of the desk, propelling them both towards the gun. Heydon rolled over her body to bring himself closer to it, but neither dared to release their grip. Heydon felt the room grow dim with a grey mist, and was strangely glad as he began to slide into unconsciousness.\nThen the hands fell from his neck. Heydon drew a long, shuddering breath before releasing his own - wet with blood. The operator's body collapsed limp onto the floor. She did not move. He had strangled her. She was dead. Heydon backed away from the body in horror.\nThe door to the cell slid open and an American tourist couple strode in. For a long second, Heydon confronted them with wild eyes and blood on his hands. Then, whimpering, he stumbled towards the door, and they scurried out of his way. He fled down the long corridors of the terminal, pursued by the image of the operator's lifeless face. Without thinking, he climbed stairs and barged through doors in his path in a bid to outrun the terror behind him. He soon found himself at one end of the terminal complex faced with nowhere to turn but back.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

A fight ensued and Heydon accidentally killed her. As two tourists entered the transmat cell to find him with blood on his hands, Heydon fled through the building in a panic...\nTo his right was a grey door marked \"Generator Room - Authorised Personnel Only\". Heydon found it unlocked and went through it, taking refuge in the dark and the cold beyond. He collapsed onto a pile of cotton waste, and hugged his legs to his chest. For the first time, Heydon wondered what he should do next. If the operator had mistaken him for a terrorist, or something, couldn't he just give himself up, reveal his true identity, and explain that he had killed her in self defence? Or maybe she was a terrorist. That would explain a lot. He might even get a medal for taking her on. But why would she target him? No, that couldn't be right. She looked more like a lunatic than a terrorist. And for all the brutality of her attack, he couldn't help feeling that she hadn't really wanted to kill him.\nHeydon's frenzied thoughts were interrupted by an electronic tone from the corridor outside, and then an emotional voice:\n\"Attention all staff and passengers. A suspected murderer is loose in the terminal. Please do not panic. If you see a man approximately 160 centimetres tall, with brown hair, wearing tan pants, and a green and white short-sleeved shirt, please alert the staff at the information desk. Do not approach or try to detain him. The police will be arriving shortly. Thankyou for your cooperation.\"\nMark Heydon picked at his shellfish platter with faint distaste. He had realised shortly after he called room service with the order that he had never really liked shellfish. For some reason he had assumed that he would enjoy it more because his employer was paying for it. Giving up on the dish, he rang room service again to ask for a burger.\nAs he replaced the phone on the bedside table near the window, Heydon's eyes were captured by the magnificent vista outside. Towers of glass and steel shimmered in the heat haze. The green and blue which framed them ran together with the fine rain which spattered the glass. Singapore.\nA sharp rap on the door roused him from his contemplation. Evidently his burger had arrived already. When he opened the door, two policemen stood outside, one with hand on holster. \"Mr Mark Heydon?\", this officer addressed him in unaccented English.\nHeydon blinked, still half expecting them to present him with a burger, and depart. They didn't, so he nodded dumbly.\n\"I am arresting you for the murder of Fay Harper. I must caution you that you do not have to say anything, and that anything you do say will be taken down and may be given in evidence. Do you understand the caution?\"\nMark Heydon awoke with a start from dreams of murder and blood. He had no idea what time it was - he hadn't dared leave the dark generator room since he had been branded a criminal over the public address system. Eventually, he had fallen asleep on the cotton waste. Rising and brushing it from his clothes, Heydon elected to risk looking outside. Cautiously, he eased open the cold metal door of the room. The light outside had changed - it was entirely artificial now. It must be night. The transmat terminal didn't close at night, of course, but if he was lucky it might be a little quieter. It was incredible that the police hadn't found him earlier. He closed the door again and considered his options. First, he would have to clean the blood off his hands. He spat on them and rubbed them on the cotton waste. And he would have to change his clothes somehow, or he would have no chance of getting out. His luggage was already in Singapore, presumably, so he would have to improvise. He took off his green and white shirt and put it back on inside out. He had a little trouble with the buttons, but at least the green didn't show from the inside. Next, the pants. He rolled the legs up as far as he could. They didn't look much like shorts, but he wasn't planning on giving anyone a close look. Trying not to think of his chances of fooling anybody, Heydon opened the door and stepped into the light.\nThe corridor was deserted. With no real idea of which way to go, Heydon set off briskly, passing corner after corner and door after door. This section of the building seemed devoid of passengers. He increased his pace. As he rounded another corner, Heydon began to recognise where he was, before he suddenly stopped in his tracks.\nA security officer. Damn! Too late to turn back; the officer had seen him. Two-way radio in hand, the man strode towards him.\n\"Evening sir,\" the officer said amiably. \"You look lost. Can I help you?\"\n\"Err... yes. Lost. Sorry,\" Heydon stammered.\nThe officer gave him directions which Heydon didn't hear. When he had finished, Heydon muttered his thanks and disappeared around the nearest corner, convinced that he would never make it out of the terminal now. The officer must have suspected, surely!\nEntering the hub of the terminal, he passed a long row of identical doors with transmat cells behind them. The door to the cell he had used that morning was now criss-crossed with blue and white plastic tape. Almost running now, Heydon emerged without further incident in the lobby of the building. There were no police in sight; not even so much as a security officer guarding the doors. Various staff went about their business, most of them ignoring him, one yawning in his direction. Surely if they believed there was a murderer in the terminal, the place should be crawling with police! Heydon didn't stop to think about it. He fled from the terminal into the night without looking back.\n\"So let me get this straight,\" Heydon confronted his arresting officer, while tearing shreds off a coffee-stained polystyrene cup. \"Fay Harper was murdered in cell 25 of the Perth transmat terminal at around 10:15am, which was around the time when I left that cell and arrived here in Singapore. Right?\"\n\"Correct. And a man fitting your description was sighted leaving the scene of the crime by two eye-witnesses.\"\n\"Leaving the scene of the crime! But if I had already left the transmat cell, how the hell did I use it to get here?\"\n\"The eye-witnesses left the cell to raise the alarm soon after you ran out. You must have gone back in...\"\n\"And operated the transmat myself? Or did I have an accomplice?\"\n\"That's what we want to know.\" The policeman smiled, almost. \"Perhaps you have a device that allows you to operate a transmat by remote control. You're a computer technician.\"\nHeydon threw down his tattered coffee cup in disgust. \"This is absurd. Maybe these so-called eye-witnesses murdered her after I'd left!\"\n\"That has been considered. They have been questioned at length, and they are no longer on our list of suspects.\"\n\"And they said the killer had blood on his hands?\" Heydon shoved his palms in the officer's face. \"Show me the blood.\"\n\"You washed it off in the men's toilets. That was why you had to leave the cell before you used it to get to Singapore.\"\nHeydon sighed in resignation and rested back in his chair. \"This will never stand up in court,\" he spat.\n\"I am not familiar with Australian courts,\" the Singaporean replied non-committally. \"You're going back there for further questioning as soon as we get authorisation.\"\nThere was a long silence. But when Heydon eventually spoke, his voice was more animated than dejected. He had thought of something. He sat up again in his chair. \"You said that shots were fired. Who fired them?\"\n\"The gun is still being analysed for fingerprints.\"\n\"Assume that mine are found.\"\n\"Oh, I do.\"\n\"Then why did I end up having to strangle her? Surely if I'm the premeditated murderer you say I am, I could at least have secured an opportunity to shoot her at close range.\"\nThe officer considered this. \"Perhaps Miss Harper suspected something, and didn't give you the chance. What does it matter?\"\n\"Because maybe the gun didn't belong to the killer at all. Only an incompetent murderer could lose a gun to an unarmed female victim.\"\n\"Your sexism betrays you, Mr Heydon. But again, what does it matter? If the gun belonged to the victim and she tried to defend herself with it, she failed. You killed her all the same.\"\n\"I'm not sure that she was the victim. What kind of murderer would attempt an attack with his bare hands, against a victim with a gun?\"\n\"Are you suggesting that Miss Harper intended to murder the person who killed her? If that were true, the charge against you could be reduced from murder to manslaughter.\"\n\"Not only that. The charge against me would have to be dropped. If the person who killed her did so in self defence, it couldn't possibly be me.\"\nThe Singaporean pondered this for a moment, before conceding defeat. \"Why not?\"\n\"Because then I truly wouldn't have been able to operate the transmat myself. There could be no question of an accomplice, or a gadget. If I killed her in self-defence, then I'm not here. I'm back in Perth.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

A fight ensued and Heydon accidentally killed her. He fled the scene in a panic. Meanwhile, apparently in Singapore, Heydon is questioned by the police about the shooting, which he claims to know nothing about. Back in Perth, after sleeping through most of the day, Heydon is amazed at being able to escape the scene of the crime after some hours without arousing police interest.\nIt was after midnight, and Heydon was shivering in a phone booth outside his favourite all hours cafe. He knew that he had to phone somebody, but he couldn't decide who. He had reduced the possibilities down to two. The first was the police, to confess what had happened that morning. Perhaps they had withdrawn from the terminal when they realised that the transmat operator had done the shooting, and that her killer had acted in self defence. If so, they would probably let him off with a caution.\nThe second possibility was his wife Penny, to let her know that he wasn't in Singapore, that he had accidentally killed somebody, that he wasn't going to confess to the police just yet, and that he couldn't come home in case they looked for him there. He fished a coin out of his pocket. Heads, the police; tails, Penny. He tossed it, caught it and slapped it on the back of his hand. Heads.\nHe dialled his home number. He let the phone ring until the engaged signal broke in. (If Penny could sleep through his snoring, the telephone would be no trouble.) He rang again for good measure, before eventually slamming the receiver down and stalking into the Tempus Fugit.\nThe cool jazz within failed to assuage Heydon's fiery mood. He ordered a cappuccino and carried it towards his favourite table at the back of the deserted cafe. He was annoyed to find that it was already taken, by a man wearing a green and whi...\nBy himself.\nWhat? Heydon steadied himself against a nearby table. His double noticed, and looked up.\n\"Hello Mark, I've been waiting for you.\" He spoke with Heydon's voice.\n\"Who the hell are you?\", Heydon managed to squeak.\n\"Don't you recognise me?\", his twin asked innocently.\nHeydon sank into a chair and studied his other self. After all he had been through, this was the last thing he needed... \"You're impersonating me. You're in league with that woman who tried to kill me. Why? What have I done?\"\n\"I'm not impersonating you, I am you. Have you ever read - Sorry, stupid question. You have, and so have I. About how transmats work.\"\n\"Transmats? What the hell -?\" Heydon was steadily growing more confused. \"They work just like replicators, except that the original copy isn't retained.\"\n\"Right; it's atomised. A transmat is just a long-distance replicator hooked up to a high powered laser to incinerate the original copy. The elements of the original are broken down, stored in the machine and recycled into passengers coming the other way.\"\n\"Like you said, I know,\" Heydon snapped, \"but what's all that got to do with you impersonating me?\"\nThe other Heydon leaned forward. \"Did you ever think why the original copy isn't retained?\"\n\"Because otherwise whenever you used the transmat, you'd end up with two...\" The other Heydon smiled. \"...two...\" Heydon's face grew pale. \"Oh my God, you are telling the truth.\"\n\"The penny drops at last,\" the other almost smirked. \"That transmat to Singapore worked; I ended up there. But my old body didn't get destroyed. The operator didn't know what to do. She knew you were supposed to be so much carbon dust and water in the storage tanks of the transmat. So she had to dispose of you quickly, any way she could.\"\n\"Dispose of? Murder!\"\n\"Murder? So who would be dead? Not Mark Heydon - here I am. I signed a form - and so did you, for that matter - consenting to having my body incinerated and reconstituted elsewhere. Actually it's reconstituted before it's incinerated, for safety reasons; but either way, you're not supposed to be here.\"\nHeydon had signed the consent form without even thinking about it. You couldn't think about it; transmats were too convenient. Like eggs; people ate them without thinking about where they come from. It was easier to accept the greatest advance in transit technology since the wheel without worrying about what became of its passengers. But it was too late now, and the more Heydon thought about it the more horrified he became.\nThe other Heydon sensed that his counterpart remained unconvinced, and kept talking. \"You're just my old body. You've kept on living for a while after you were supposed to, but I'm Mark Heydon now. I know this must be hard to accept, but you can't expect to take over my life just because you used to be me. You consented to have your body destroyed. Your mind lives on in here.\" He tapped his skull.\n\"So what the hell are you saying?\", Heydon challenged him.\n\"Mark, I am going to ask you to do something which you will have to think very hard about,\" the other said in suddenly more reasonable tones. Heydon looked at him impassively, so he continued. \"I want to ask you if you will trust me to take over your life. I want the Mark Heydon who stepped into cell 25 yesterday to pass on the reins to the Mark Heydon who arrived in Singapore a moment later. That was what you always intended to do.\"\nHeydon could hardly believe what he was hearing. \"You want me to kill myself, don't you.\"\n\"Don't think of it like that. I've worked out the perfect way to do it. You can go back to the transmat machine you used yesterday. Instransit can set it to send you to Singapore, but disable the transmat at the other side, so that you never arrive. It will be just like taking the transmat you intended to yesterday, except that I arrived a little early.\"\n\"How dare you ask me to kill myself!\", Heydon spluttered.\n\"Be reasonable, Mark,\" the other pleaded, with a self-conscious glance around the cafe. \"There isn't room in my life for two of me. Which of us would get the job? The house? The car?\"\n\"We could divide them up.\"\n\"Penny?\"\nHeydon had no answer. But he had a feeling that something was wrong. This was all too clinical, too perfunctory. \"That's not like me,\" he accused the other. His conviction grew. \"That is not like me. If you're me, you couldn't possibly be so dispassionate. You would never ask me to kill myself... not unless your own life was in danger.\" The other made no reply. Although Heydon was sure his other self knew what he meant, he spelt it out anyway. \"You're hiding something.\"\nFor a moment the other looked as if he was going to deny it, but instead he held up his wrist to reveal a tight metal bracelet. \"Do you know what this is? It's a bail bracelet. It lets the police know exactly where I am. If I try to take it off it will inject an anaesthetic drug into my bloodstream, and we'll be knee deep in officers within minutes.\"\n\"Why? What have you done?\"\n\"Murdered a transmat operator.\"\n\"But you didn't kill her, I did.\"\n\"You don't bloody well say!\", the other exploded. \"But they still don't believe that you exist! There are only two ways for me to prove to them that you do. First, they can check with Instransit to try to confirm my story. They're going to do that tomorrow morning. The transmat I - we - used was damaged by gunfire when the operator was killed, so nobody else has travelled in it. If they find that the laser incinerator is broken, like I think it is, that will be good evidence that I'm telling the truth, and they'll come looking for you.\"\n\"And the other way?\"\nThe other Heydon started involuntarily. \"Pardon?\"\n\"You said there were two ways that they could be convinced that I exist.\"\n\"Err... yes. That's if you give yourself up. They'll take your body to be atomised, and they'll set me free. Otherwise, you'll only be delaying the inevitable. You'll have to live in hiding, and I'll have to serve time for a murder I didn't commit. It's not worth it for either of us.\"\nHeydon wasn't listening any more. He was watching the other Heydon's eyes. They were hiding something again. Giving himself up hadn't been the alternative the other had intended to mention; there was something else. Something he didn't want Heydon to know. Too late, he realised that his own eyes were as transparent to the other Heydon as the other's were to him. The other sprang away from the table with a table knife in hand. In the fraction of a second that followed, Heydon was engulfed with emotions. Disbelief, that someone closer than a twin could think of threatening his life. Fear for his safety. Then amusement, as the inadequacy of the weapon before him registered. Finally horror, as he realised that it wasn't intended as a weapon at all. The other held his wrist out in front of his body, and slid the knife under the metal bracelet. With a sharp motion of his hand a red light on the bracelet began to flash, and the other's body slumped unconscious to the floor.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

With a sharp motion of his hand a red light on the bracelet began to flash, and the other's body slumped unconscious to the floor.\nFor a moment, Heydon stood paralysed. Then the noise of a police siren from several blocks away roused him into action. Pushing aside a waiter in his path, he bolted out of the cafe and fled into darkness. As the pitch and volume of the siren swelled he turned into a grimy alley, his heart pounding. He collapsed into a pile of cardboard boxes and wafted until the noise had gone. For the second time in twenty four hours Heydon found himself at a loss for what to do next. If what his other self had said was true, turning himself in to the police could well be a death sentence. Going home would be almost as risky. But he couldn't keep running forever; he had to tell someone what had happened. If his own flesh and blood didn't care, who else would listen to his story?\n\"Good evening, and welcome to Mike Carr Live, this 23rd day of November 2023. Tonight, we preview Prince William's shocking new unauthorised biography, a survivor of the San Francisco Massacre tells his tale, and we celebrate sixty years of a television legend. But first; two days ago, Mark Heydon stepped into a transmat cubicle in Perth and seconds later stepped out of another cubicle in Singapore. Nothing so unusual about that. But in a freak transmat malfunction, Mark didn't disappear from the cubicle in Perth. This means that there are now two identical copies of his body, one of which joins us now. Mark, is Perth big enough for the two of you?\"\n\"I hope so, but we still have a lot of sorting out to do. It looks as if we're going to live separate lives, which means we'll have to divide up everything we have. Things are never going to be the same. For starters, I'm never going to use a transmat again.\"\n\"You must be annoyed with lnstransit for allowing this to happen,\" Mike Carr prompted,\n\"For saving my life? If the transmat hadn't malfunctioned I wouldn't be sifting here. I would be nothing more than a pile of ash by now.\"\n\"But you would still be alive in another body,\" the interviewer argued. Heydon shook his head.\n\"That other body would not be me. I have two bodies now, but only one of them is mine. This one. The moment my body was replicated in Singapore it became a new person. That didn't give Instransit a licence to kill my old body. It sickens me now to think of how many times I've been a party to the incineration of a living being, all for the sake of convenient transportation.\"\nMike had not been expecting this. \"Surely if people are deconstituted in one place and reconstituted in another, and they feel that they are the same person, nobody is actually being killed.\"\n\"I disagree. I am a living, breathing, thinking human being. If you believe in that sort of thing, I have a soul. Could you kill me now, just because a copy of my body is walking around somewhere else?\"\n\"Well if you put it that way, I suppose not,\" Mike tittered uncomfortably, \"but getting onto a less morbid topic...\"\n\"No,\" Heydon interjected, \"let's stick with this topic. I've thought about what Instransit is doing a lot in the past couple of days, and I'm convinced that they're practicing genocide. Did you know that they had to get the law changed so that they could operate their machines? It used to be called murder to fry somebody with a laser. As far as anyone knows, it's a painless death. But nobody's been able to confirm it.\"\n\"Obviously you're very upset by what's happened...,\" Mike interrupted in a firm but calming voice.\n\"You're damn right I'm upset, and so should everyone else be. People have got to know what's happening to them whenever they use the transmat.\"\n\"Thanks for coming in Mark; I'm afraid we've run out of time.\"\nHeydon ignored him. \"Do you know what happens to the ashes? Each of us - everyone who has ever used a transmat - is a walking graveyard! We're made up of other people's flesh! Other people's snot, other people's bile, other people's shit!\"\nMike Carr broke in hurriedly. \"We'll take a break now and be right back.\" The lights dimmed and the presenter earnestly scribbled a zig-zag on the note-pad on his desk.

Then again, he thought, a lift had never ruined his life.\n\"Mr Heydon?\"\nHeydon looked up from his coffee at an imposing figure dressed in a black suit. The figure gazed at him with pale eyes set deep in a wrinkled face. \"I've been waiting for you,\" it said.\nHeydon gaped for a moment, half expecting the figure to produce a scythe. Then he realised that his instinct was not far wrong. He had just broadcast his location to hundreds of thousands of television viewers. This was surely a detective police constable come to arrest him. For lack of any better response, Heydon decided to act innocent. \"Waiting for me?\"\n\"For three years,\" the figure assured him. Ever since the inaugural transmat journey from New York to Beijing.\"\nIn what was becoming a distressingly familiar experience, Heydon once again resigned himself to confusion. \"Are you here to arrest me?\"\n\"Arrest you? I'm here to congratulate you. Until your broadcast tonight, nobody else had dared voice the truth. I myself have been treated as a crackpot for attempting to do so. My League is still very small.\"\n\"Your League?\" Heydon repeated.\n\"The Libertarian Humanist League. Dr Julian Asqui, President.\" He extended his hand, which Heydon took. \"We fight the dehumanisation of social life. Transmats epitomise this phenomenon. More than any other modern convenience, transmats strike at the very essence of our humanity. They are quite literally soul-destroying. You said as much yourself.\"\n\"Did I?\" Heydon asked, wondering whether he might have overstated his case before the cameras.\n\"Oh, yes. Transmats may be able to recreate human bodies cell by cell, but the soul of the poor human who was destroyed is lost forever. The body which is replicated at the other end is a husk... a soulless being. Barred from the afterlife.\"\n\"I see,\" Heydon observed, somewhat inadequately, as he thought. Dr Asqui continued in an animated voice.\n\"Now that you have publicised our cause as we could not, the time is right. Instransit will fall within before the year is out. But we need help. Nobody knows me, and the League is viewed as just another conservative pressure group. You, on the other hand - and if you'll forgive me - are simply an ordinary man who has discovered the threat that high technology poses to us all. People will listen to you, in their thousands. In their millions.\"\nHeydon almost laughed out loud, invisioning himself - a computer technician - as spokesman for an anti-technology group. \"No. I don't want to be a hero. I just want to get my life back together.\"\n\"Of course. But will you join us for a few days? That's all it will take for the momentum to build. Come with me now and I'll give you a bed. In the morning I will introduce you to the Vice-President of the League. I guarantee you, people will listen to us now. They will have no choice. Then you can get back to your life, with an entire nation behind you.\"\nHeydon opened his mouth to refuse, but couldn't think of any reason to give. After all, he did need somewhere to sleep while he was a wanted man, as he assumed he still was. And he did care about what transmats were doing to people. Convinced that he would regret what he was about to do, he said, \"Yes. I'll join you, for a few days.\" Then he smiled. \"Let's trash some transmats.\"\nDr Asqui clapped his arm around Heydon's shoulder as he led him out of the canteen.\nHeydon awoke to hear his name being spoken on an early morning news programme on a TV in an adjoining room. His fifteen minutes of fame, he thought glumly. He raised himself and yawned. Dr Asqui had set up a bed for him in a spare room and left him some toiletries. Heydon availed himself of them before joining Dr Asqui before the television, which was now showing a story about a painting cat.\n\"Mr Heydon!\" Dr Asqui beamed. \"It's started,\" he said gleefully, handing Heydon the morning newspaper, \"Even sooner than I expected.\" The newspaper was folded over to display a headline, which read \"Other People's Flesh Claim Shocks Catholics\". Heydon scanned the article, which summarised Mike Carr's interview with him the previous evening, and added that a representative of the Catholic church \"had been unaware\" and \"was disturbed\" by the mechanics of the transmat process, and had promised that \"the church would carefully consider its position\".\nAs he read on, the doorbell sounded, and Dr Asqui answered it. \"Natasha, good morning. He's here - come in.\"\nA severe woman entered the room carrying a briefcase. She was in her forties, with short dark hair and two badges on her black jacket. One badge bore the name of the Libertarian Humanist League and a picture of a what appeared to be a forearm, fist clenched, shackled with an optical fibre cable. The other badge displayed a black and red design which Heydon could not identify.\nShe nodded curtly at him and said, \"Natasha Morris. Glad to meet you.\"\n\"Mark Heydon,\" he replied.\n\"Miss Morris is the Vice-President of the League,\" Dr Asqui informed him, as she set her briefcase on the table and examined its contents. \"She will be joining us this morning.\"\n\"Joining us where? Where are we going?\"\n\"To the transmat terminal. For the first battle of the war.\" He seemed about to reveal more, but finished simply, \"I've invited the media, so you may wish to prepare a statement.\"\nNatasha was at the door again. \"No time. We should leave now. I'll be in the car waiting for you.\"\n\"She's very keen,\" Dr Asqui apologised as he followed her and motioned for Heydon to do the same. Bemused but curious, he joined them in the silver car that growled impatiently in the driveway. Natasha's face bore no expression as she steered the car towards the transmat terminal from which Heydon had been running.\nAs they approached the building, Heydon noted a van from Mike Carr Live and a radio station's car in the terminal's sparsely occupied car park. \"I hope they're not expecting a mass demonstration,\" he observed to his companions. \"Why didn't you bring the rest of your League along?\"\n\"In time,\" Dr Asqui assured him, \"but first we need to let them know who we are.\" The car stopped in a side street and its passengers stepped out. Natasha Morris silently led the way with briefcase in hand, followed by Dr Asqui and Heydon. Some distance from the entrance, Dr Asqui instructed him, \"You stay outside and speak to the journalists, while we have a word to the management of this terminal.\" As his companions left him, Heydon wondered what he had let himself in for.\nHe stopped when he reached Mike Carr's van and was immediately accosted by a journalist with cameraman in tow. \"Mr Heydon,\" the suited reporter barked, \"Religious and medical groups are currently discussing the ethical implications of transmat use; the Catholic church is believed to have referred the issue to the Vatican. Do you believe that transmats are going to join contraceptives and abortion as the new Catholic taboo of the twenties?\"\n\"I have no idea,\" Heydon replied, flustered, \"I'm not a Catholic.\"\nAnother journalist appeared, and demanded, \"Do you say that transmats should be banned, or should people have freedom of choice?\"\n\"I don't think that they need to be banned. When it becomes possible to construct transmat machines on a larger scale they will be useful for the transportation of goods. But if I have my way, people will think twice before transmatting their own bodies from place to place.\"\n\"Mr Heydon,\" the first journalist insisted, \"what did you come here to prove today?\"\n\"Well, two friends of mine have gone inside the building to confront the management of Instransit about the issues...\" Heydon broke off as the other journalist dashed inside the terminal to cover this latest story. After a moment's hesitation and an apologetic look, the first journalist followed him. Left alone again, Heydon pondered the fickleness of celebrity.\nShortly Dr Asqui and Natasha Morris emerged from the terminal and set off back to the car at a brisk pace. Heydon ran after them. \"Is that it?\" he asked. \"What happened?\"\n\"We've made our mark,\" Dr Asqui said mysteriously. \"Watch the evening news tonight.\"\nHeydon objected, \"The media may be interested now, but in a few weeks they'll have forgotten all about it. Transmats are too useful to be killed by a little bad press. If things are going to change, there needs to be a groundswell. I don't think enough people are listening yet.\"\n\"I'm not so sure, Mr Heydon. I think people will listen. This time, they will listen.\"\nThey walked on as Heydon considered Dr Asqui's remark. Then his heart stopped as he noticed that Natasha was no longer carrying her briefcase.\nAcross the road, the walls of the transmat terminal erupted on the crest of a ball of roaring flame.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

At the same time as he fled from the scene, he appeared to be in Singapore, and was questioned there by police. The two Heydons met and the Heydon from Singapore explained that in a transmat malfunction his body had been transmitted to its destination without the original copy in Perth being destroyed. This Heydon, having been charged with the murder, entreats the first Heydon to surrender. He refuses, and now horrified by transmat technology, tells his tale on current affairs television. A radical anti-technology group take up Heydon's cause, and he joins two members, Dr Julian Asqui and Natasha Morris, at a demonstration at the transmat terminal.\nHeydon objected, \"The media may be interested now, but in a few weeks they'll have forgotten all about it.

Then his heart stopped as he noticed that Natasha was no longer carrying her briefcase.\nAcross the road, the walls of the transmat terminal erupted on the crest of a ball of roaring flame.\nFor Heydon, the screams of car alarms were the death cries of charred victims. He hardly noticed his own voice joining the chorus. As the debris settled, the devastation gradually receded from view, as if by the force of Heydon's denial. But it was Natasha Morris dragging him away by his collar. He wrenched himself free and faced his companions with wild eyes.\n\"What have you done?\" he stammered as he regained control over his voice.\n\"What had to be done,\" Dr Asqui snapped. \"Now get into the car, quickly.\"\n\"Murderers!\" he cried hysterically.\n\"You have a short memory, Mr Heydon. Last night you were the very revolutionary. Didn't you say something like, 'Let's trash some transmats'?\"\n\"I didn't mean this, you know I didn't! I don't think Instransit should run a transportation system by destroying people's bodies and reprocessing their remains. But blowing up innocent people is even worse!\"\n\"You're a coward, Mr Heydon,\" Dr Asqui accused him as Natasha slammed the driver's side door and started the engine. \"The world is full of cowards. They don't know how to travel any more, to entertain themselves, to cook food to eat, without using computers and machines. They don't realise how precious their humanity is, and they are too scared to fight to win it back.\" Dr Asqui briefly held the car door open for Heydon, then stepped inside himself and closed it.\nThe silver car accelerated and Heydon was left alone. He ran, pursued by images of flaming bodies and with wails of death in his ears.\nDetective Constable Pearsall and Constable McKellar waited outside the door of 15 Lafayette Street, Joondalup, as footsteps approached to answer their knock. A young woman with short brown hair opened the door smiling, then concerned.\n\"Can I help you?\" she asked.\n\"DC Pearsall, Constable McKellar,\" announced Pearsall, a tall greying woman. \"We would like a word with Mr Heydon please, if he's in.\"\n\"Er... yes, in the end room tinkering with his computers. Follow me, please.\" Penny Heydon led the officers into a cramped workshop criss-crossed with optical cable and stacked with decapitated computers and monitors.\n\"Good morning officers,\" Heydon greeted them as he extricated his head from the shell of a Zhang Yao VX-32.\n\"Morning Mr Heydon. Do you know where your other self is at the moment?\" asked Constable McKellar, a stocky Scotsman.\n\"Last time I saw him he was making a fool of himself on the Mike Carr show. Making a fool of myself, too, more to the point. I would have thought you'd have nabbed him in the TV studio, if you're still going to charge him over that transmat operator.\"\n\"Unfortunately we are now investigating a more serious charge,\" McKellar stated.\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Have you been watching TV this morning Mr Heydon?\"\n\"No, I've been working. Hang on though...\" Heydon wheeled his chair over to a large monitor displaying a complex fractal image, which disappeared when he moved a nearby mouse and clicked on a TV icon at the bottom of the screen. A window appeared displaying a television reporter standing in a pile of rubble outside the smoking wreck of a building.\n\"...yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but police are searching for Mark Heydon, a Perth man who was recently involved in a bizarre transmat accident, and who made an emotional appearance on a television current affairs programme last night denouncing transmat use.\"\nHeydon's face appeared on the screen, saying, \"I've thought about what Instransit is doing a lot in the past couple of days, and I'm convinced that they're practicing genocide. Did you know that they had to get the law changed so that they could operate their machines?\"\nThe reporter's voice cut in over Heydon's. \"Just before he was tragically killed in the blast, a reporter for the same current affairs programme spoke again with Mr Heydon close to where I am standing now.\"\nHeydon remained on the screen, but the undamaged transmat terminal appeared in the background. Heydon said, \"If I have my way, people will think twice before transmatting their own bodies from place to place.\"\nAgain the reporter cut in. \"It is believed that Mr Heydon may have joined a terrorist group opposed to...\" His hand trembling, Heydon clicked the mute button at the bottom of the window and the room fell silent.\nEventually DC Pearsall said, \"We'd like you to help us Mr Heydon. As the media has guessed, we believe your other self may have been recruited by a radical anti-technology group; probably the LHL - Libertarian Humanist League.\"\n\"That doesn't sound like him, officer; he's no Luddite.\" Heydon spread his hands. \"Look at his office.\"\n\"You saw his interview last night,\" Pearsall responded. \"He's a disturbed man now. He doesn't know how to react to his predicament except by attacking what he sees as its cause.\"\nWith an impatient glance at his colleague McKellar said, \"We don't have time to psychoanalyse him, anyway. The media doesn't know it yet, but Instransit has received threats to each of its other Australian terminals that have been traced to a Perth public phone. We need to find him now, and we need you to help us.\"\n\"Okay,\" Heydon relented, \"so I'll help you. But Perth's a big city. I wouldn't know where to start looking.\"\n\"You didn't take long to track him down last time,\" McKellar noted.\n\"He won't be going back to the Tempus Fugit in a hurry, believe me,\" Heydon rejoined.\nPearsall brought her face close to Heydon's and spoke in a low voice. \"I strongly advise you to do your best. Because if he kills again, you're going to have a hard time doing your weekly shopping. Unless you know a very good plastic surgeon.\"\nHeydon sat at his favourite table at the back of the Tempus Fugit and sipped a cappucino, accompanied by the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker. For an hour he had been trying to identify the songs he recognised, or to read the posters along the side wall, or to make a boat out of his serviette, but his mind kept returning to Julian Asqui, Natasha Morris, and others he never knew, now charred into anonymity. And to Penny, his wife. He had to try to ring her again. He left the cappucino on the table with a ten dollar note and made towards the telephone booth outside the cafe.\nThe phone rang twice, and his own voice answered it. \"Hello, Mark Heydon speaking.\" Heydon cursed his surprise, and began to replace the receiver.\n\"Hello? Hello, who is this?\" the other Heydon insisted, then guessed, \"It's you, isn't it?\"\nPenny called out, distantly, \"Who is it, Mark?\"\n\"Nobody - just a friend,\" her husband called back, then whispered, \"We have to meet. Where are you?\"\nHeydon gave in. \"I'm outside Tempus Fugit.\"\n\"Nobody noticed you in there?\"\n\"Do they ever?\"\n\"Maybe not, but you weren't famous before. You're lucky cafe patrons don't watch the daytime news.\"\n\"I've been on the news?\"\n\"You're the big lead the police have on the transmat terminal bombing. Not that they needed to do much detective work, given that you held a press conference before the big event.\"\n\"Would I have, if I had anything to do with the bombing?\"\n\"Frankly, the police aren't sure of your sanity at the moment. Your performance on Mike Carr last night had an air of mania about it.\"\n\"I was angry about the way lnstransit is playing with human life. I still am.\"\n\"The worst of it is that a lot of people seem to agree with you, according to the media. But of course, they all deplore what you've done - allegedly done,\" Heydon corrected.\n\"Surely you don't think I did it.\"\n\"It's certainly not the kind of thing I'd do, but then I don't know how far gone you are. Either way, you're in big trouble at the moment.\"\n\"Do you have any more gems of advice for me before I hang up?\" Heydon spat.\n\"As a matter of fact, I do. The police have come to me for help in finding you, and I've managed to a arrange a deal with them.\"\n\"I'm listening.\"\n\"You give yourself up peacefully. After you're tried for the transmat bombing and you either serve your time or walk, you'll be enrolled in the witness relocation programme, and start a new life under a new name.\"\n\"That's a deal? What's the alternative?\"\n\"You spend the next few days as a fugitive, the police hunt you down, and you spend the rest of your life in prison under your own name.\"\n\"Goodbye,\" Heydon intoned.\n\"Wait, don't go yet,\" the other demanded.\n\"Why not?\"\n\"I haven't told you about everything that's happened. The Libertarian Humanist League and Right to Life Australia have organised a joint rally for tomorrow morning to lobby the government to ban transmats altogether. And Instransit have just announced that they'll be temporarily closing their Australian terminals for a security and maintenance inspection.\"\n\"Is that all?\"\n\"Er, no. The Catholic church...\"\n\"I don't give a toss about the Catholic church, Mark. If you haven't got anything important to say, I'm going.\"\n\"No, don't, please. Let's talk about that deal again,\" the other suggested.\nA gloved hand knocked on the glass of the telephone booth. Heydon waved it away impatiently. Then he noticed it was attached to a police officer's jacket.\n\"Mark Heydon?\" DC Pearsall asked.\n\"I'm sorry, Mark,\" came the voice at his ear.\n\"I am arresting you for wilful murder.\"\n\"But I meant what I said about the deal. Think about it.\" There was a click at the other end.\n\"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so...\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

All the SF awards most of us have ever heard of - the Hugo, the Nebula, the Ditmar, the Philip K Dick - Neuromancer won on its release in 1984. Apart from originating the genre of cyberpunk, the novel also introduced fresh concepts and styles into SF that have found their way into other genres of fiction and into everyday parlance. The novel is offensive in parts and annoying in others, but remains immensely rewarding to read eleven years after its publication.\nThe story's protagonist is known simply as Case. He is, or was, the equivalent of a modern-day hacker, and as such he has a principled distaste for the flesh, and the needs and urges that accompany it. Case once strove to escape his flesh in the virtual reality of the matrix, where his mind seemed to possess an independent existence, like a computer program suspended in RAM. However when he was caught stealing, his employer terminated his life as a console cowboy by injecting him with an engineered toxin. As the novel begins Case is working in a seedy district of Chiba, Japan, buying and selling computer hardware and software on the black market. He counts his life expectancy in days, and thinks payback has finally come when he finds an intruder in his hotel room.\nHer name is Molly; she works as a mercenary, go-between and general hired hand. She has artificial eyes that look like mirrored glasses, retractable blades beneath each fingernail, and in the course of the novel is wired to transmit her sensory impressions to Case in real-time VR (\"sim-stim\").\n06:27:52 by the chip in her optic nerve; Case had been following her progress through Villa Straylight for over an hour, letting the endorphin analog she'd taken blot out his hangover. The pain in her leg was gone; she seemed to move through a warm bath. The Braun drone was perched on her shoulder, its tiny manipulators, like padded surgical clips, secure in the polycarbon of the Modern suit.\nMolly, Case and Riviera (who has an implant that enables him to create illusions in other people's minds) are hired by one Mr Armitage to perform a job - what, they aren't told. Case, for his part, is given a special incentive to perform the task for which he's been hired.\n\"You have fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of various main arteries, Case. They're dissolving. Very slowly, but they definitely are dissolving. Each one contains a mycotoxin. You're already familiar with the effects of that mycotoxin. It was the one your former employers gave you in Memphis.\"\nBut Armitage, whose too-perfect face has been reconstructed and whose past appears to have been also, does not seem to be running the show. The nature of their quest and who - or what - is really behind it, are clearly related but hidden from Molly and Case. As Armitage leads them around the world and later into space, they make their own inquiries as to Armitage's identity and the secret purpose of their mission.\nUndoubtedly the most famous contribution of Neuromancer to the English language is cyberspace. Gibson's conception of cyberspace is of a 3D virtual reality visual representation of computer data. The term is often used today to describe the Internet, but nothing on the Internet approximates cyberspace as Gibson saw it.\nThe Chinese virus was unfolding around them. Polychrome shadow, countless translucent layers shifting and recombining. Protean, enormous, it towered above them, blotting out the void.\nNeuromancer is occasionally unlikely, especially to computer literate readers, but it is never dull. High-technological concepts flow thick and fast, with no pause for explanation. As if Gibson feared being accused of including an insufficiency of ideas in his novel, Neuromancer explores artificial intelligence, psychic projection, Japanese and Rastafarian culture, drugs, cyber-prostitution and personality constructs stored in silicon.\n\"Remember being here, a second ago?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Know how a ROM personality matrix works?\"\n\"Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct.\"\n\"So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential, real time memory?\"\n\"Guess so,\" said the construct.\n\"Okay, Dix. You are a ROM construct. Got me?\"\n\"If you say so,\" said the construct. \"Who are you?\"\nGibson's debut novel, Neuromancer is also widely considered to be his best. For some it is the cynical mood of techno-fetishism that makes cyberpunk, and Neuromancer wallows in this from its famous first line (\"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel\") to its last. But unlike some of its paler imitations, the novel also has plot, characters and style. The plot may not be of a traditional structure (wait for the beach scene near the end of the book), the characters may be amoral and difficult to relate to, but the book as a whole is one of the finest examples of inventive fiction ever written.\nNeuromancer is not simply the novel that started a subcultural movement, it is also literature in every sense of the word. Those few readers who haven't experienced Neuromancer yet are strongly encouraged to do so.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Psychic Clara tells how!\" Unconvinced, Heydon cast the New Woman back onto the pile and fished for an elderly Time from the police station's mean selection. It had been at least two hours since the interview room door had closed on his double and he had been banished to a waiting room. It was the station's policy to provide relatives of interviewees with coffee while they waited. Heydon sipped his. He discarded the Time and chose a Wired.\n\"Mr Heydon?\" a voice beckoned him at last. He followed the young officer along grey corridors and down a flight of stairs, not to the interview room but to a warren of holding cells. His other self stood outside an open cell door flanked by DC Pearsall and Constable McKellar. His eyes were red-rimmed, and his clothes - the same green shirt and tan pants he had worn since the transmat accident - were crumpled and stale.\n\"We've decided to keep Mr Heydon in custody while we complete our enquiries,\" McKellar reported.\n\"Can I have a minute with him, alone?\" Heydon asked.\nThe officer glanced at DC Pearsall, who extended her hand toward the cell. \"Be our guest.\" She prodded the prisoner inside, and the other Heydon followed as the metal door clanged shut.\nThe prisoner ignored the other Heydon, shuffling towards the cell's narrow bed and reclining without a word.\n\"So what did you tell them?\" Heydon asked conversationally. The figure on the bed ignored him. \"Did you agree to be relocated?\"\n\"Stuff you,\" the prisoner spat. \"That's all you're worried about, isn't it? I'm an inconvenience. You just want me out of the way so that you can resume your cosy little life. Well no, as it happens I didn't agree to be relocated. When this is all over I'm going back home with Penny and resuming my job.\"\nHeydon chuckled uneasily and shook his head. \"She's mine, Mark, and it's my job. You've lost them both now. You're known around Australia as a terrorist. I'm not blaming you, but do you think Penny's going to prefer a criminal for a husband, or me?\"\n\"You bastard,\" the prisoner breathed, rising from the bed.\n\"I'm telling it like it is, Mark,\" the other Heydon insisted. \"I mean, look at you. You're a wreck. You go nuts on Mike Carr Live in front of millions of viewers. The next day you blow up one of his reporters - or one of your loony mates does. You're unhinged. An accessory to murder, at the very least.\"\n\"You utter bastard,\" the prisoner exclaimed. \"Isn't it enough for you to ruin my life? Do you have to taunt me in my jail cell as well? You keep it up and I'm not going to be just an accessory to murder.\"\nThe other smiled condescendingly. \"This is exactly what I mean. You are not me any more, you're somebody else. I was never violent like this. Even if you don't go to jail, I'm not letting you within a mile of Penny again.\"\nHis smile didn't have time to fade before it met the prisoner's fist.\n\"Better check on the twins,\" Pearsall remarked, glancing at the clock on the wall. McKellar nodded, and motioned to the custody sergeant who accompanied him to Heydon's cell. McKellar snapped open a metal plate in the cell door and peered inside. One of the occupants, wearing a green and white shirt, lay still on the cell's bed, watched over by the other.\n\"You done?\" McKellar asked.\n\"Er, yeah, yeah,\" Heydon muttered, turning and wiping his hands on his jeans.\n\"What did you do, sing him a lullaby?\" McKellar glanced towards the prone figure.\n\"Just tired I guess, after so long on the run,\" Heydon replied.\nThe custody sergeant swung open the door to let Heydon out, and locked it again with a silver key-card.\n\"I don't suppose you'll be wanting to stay around any longer, will you?\" McKellar asked.\n\"No indeed,\" Heydon assured him, \"I'm off home.\"\n\"You've been a great help, Mark. I'll show you out.\" The Scotsman escorted Heydon to the door to the police station, where he paused and extended his hand. \"Thanks again. We'll call you again when we need you.\" Heydon clasped McKellar's hand for a moment, then hurried out of the building, located his car in the car park, and drove away at speed.\nMark Heydon awoke on a plastic mattress with his skull aching. The room was dark, and it was not his own. He realised where he was in a few seconds, and why he was there the second after. Frantically, he stumbled to the cell door and began to kick it, yelling for help.\nAfter three minutes of continued kicking, a bleary face appeared in the window of the door. \"Yeah, whadissit?\"\n\"Let me out! You've got the wrong man! There's been a mistake!\" The red-eyed officer shook his head and started to close the metal plate over the window. Heydon yelped, \"Wait! Let me speak to Constables Pearsall or McKellar.\"\n\"They'll be in in the morning. Now let me go and get some... do my work.\" The metal plate clanged shut.\nHeydon paced the cell for hours. He tried to get back to sleep, but failed. He kicked the cell door, but nobody came. Eventually light and activity began to return to the station and an officer brought him breakfast. Heydon refused it and demanded to see his arresting officers. The officer left the breakfast tray and locked the door.\nIt opened again after some minutes and Pearsall and McKellar stood outside. \"You been causing trouble, Mr Heydon?\" the former asked.\n\"Damn right I have,\" Heydon exclaimed, \"I'm not supposed to be here. The Mark Heydon you're after - the terrorist - knocked me out and took my clothes. I'm the guy who helped you catch him. You've got to let me out of here!\"\nPearsall smirked. \"Nice try, Mr Heydon. We'll let you out soon enough for your committal.\" As she made to leave, Heydon grabbed her arm.\n\"Think about it for a moment, Constable,\" he insisted. \"Two men, identical except for their clothes. Both of them are left alone in a cell. When the cell door is opened one of them is unconscious. Now you don't need to be a senior detective to twig to what's happened!\"\nPearsall released her arm forcibly, but made no further move to leave. Heydon met McKellar's unsteady gaze. Unnerved, the Scot challenged him, \"So what do expect us to do - take your word for it and let you go?\"\n\"Not yet; I'll help you find him first. Handcuff me, chain me up if you need to, stick me in the back of a police car and let's go find him.\" The officers silently considered this proposition. Heydon added for effect, \"I don't need to tell you that you're going to have a lot of paperwork to do when it turns out that you let the wrong man go free. The sooner you find him again the better we're all going to sleep.\"\nThe officers consulted each other in low voices. Pearsall eventually stated flatly, \"We'll take car 14,\" and turned to leave. McKellar prodded Heydon down the corridor and led the way out of the building.\n\"No cuffs?\" Heydon asked as they reached the car and Pearsall opened the back door for him.\n\"Just get in, before I change my mind,\" the detective replied curtly.\n\"So,\" McKellar addressed Heydon obsequiously as the car pulled away, \"you're the boss; where do we go?\"\nHeydon missed the intended irony. \"There are two obvious places we should try first, although he'll probably be too smart to be at either of them. Home, and the Tempus Fugit. We've been lucky at the Tempus Fugit twice before, so we might as well try again there.\"\nMcKellar obeyed and turned the police car towards the inner-city's cafe district. As in other cities, the location of Perth's most fashionable venues migrated in an unpredictable manner from year to year. The current cafe district of choice occupied the site of an unsuccessful urban residential project.\nAs the car turned into Wellington Street near the city centre, Pearsall swore aloud. \"I almost forgot about that bloody demonstration. We should have tried Heydon's home first.\" The road ahead was clogged with marching demonstrators. Gaudy placards read, \"Transmat genocide\" - \"Instransit destroy souls for money\" - \"Death by transmat\" - \"Mark Heydon is innocent\".\nTwo police escorts on motorcycles led the parade. McKellar wound down the window and bellowed at one, \"Let us through Ryan, this is urgent.\" The cycle stopped and Ryan attempted to clear a path through the throng. The car inched forward as the crowd parted.\nBefore the police car had progressed ten metres, a voice from the crowd rang out, \"There he is! It's Mark Heydon! Look, in the back of the police car - they're carting him off to jail.\"\nIn seconds, the path ahead of the car disappeared as it was surrounded by shouting, gesticulating demonstrators. There was a sudden jolt and a scream from near the front wheels. DC Pearsall ordered, \"Stop the car for Chrissakes, you'll kill someone!\" As McKellar trod the brake pedal to the floor, fists and feet hailed on the car's bonnet and boot. A maniacal face was thrust against the windscreen, then disappeared as its owner clambered onto the roof of the vehicle. A wailing teenager nursing a bloody sleeve was dragged from under the car. Pearsall grabbed the radio from its housing and called for back-up as McKellar gunned the motor in what he hoped was a threatening manner.\nThe car lurched to the side as a group of demonstrators attempted to roll it over. The man on the roof fell onto the sea of bodies on the other side, crushing two to the ground. The car lurched again. Then with a crunch the rear window caved in, glass fragments spraying the back seat as they were cleared from the jagged window with a metal pipe. Muscled hands reached in and grabbed Heydon by the shoulders. For a moment it seemed that the seat belt would hold him, but the hands loosened it and pulled him up with insane strength. He could feel his shirt being shredded as the hands dragged him out over the shards of the rear window.\nThe hands were a woman's, and she wore a black jacket adorned with badges. The woman clasped Heydon's body in a fierce grip. Pearsall clambered into the back seat as she unholstered her revolver, but Natasha Morris had already dissolved into the crowd. Someone saw Pearsall's weapon and screamed, \"She's got a gun!\". Once again the car lurched sideways, but this time it rose inexorably to the vertical, teetered on its side, and crashed upside down to the ground, scattering demonstrators in its wake. The shards of the rear window closed like incisors on Pearsall's neck.\nA middle-aged man in a black suit was hoisted onto the car's underside where he raised his fist with one arm and a megaphone with the other. \"Friends, it is time to fight back!\" his distorted voice echoed. A cheer rose and died away. \"Don't think that Instransit is our only enemy - even the police are against us. Perhaps the only man to have survived the transmat's death ray has just now been rescued from their clutches.\" A smaller cheer rose from the middle of the crowd where Heydon struggled in Natasha's arms. \"Mark Heydon has revealed to us how transmats destroy the bodies we were born with and cobble together replacements from other people's flesh. These replacements - like Frankenstein's monster - are soulless abominations.\" The man's pale eyes searched the crowd. \"Many of you may not believe in existence of the soul, but the proof is here beneath my feet. Who was responsible for Mark Heydon's capture by the police, but his soulless brother? This is a betrayal that must be avenged.\" The crowd surged around the car, inflamed by their leader's call. \"Now is the time to act,\" he urged the frenzied mob, \"before humanity is completely subjugated by machines. It is time to fight!\" The crowd roared as one. Triumphant, Dr Asqui lit a rag and tossed it into the workings of the upturned police car, leaping to the ground as it began to blaze.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Then, the teacher sent Hano with the investigator to a storeroom, where the man questioned Hano about his father's religious beliefs... The investigator was squat and had a beady-eyed, sandrat face and a nervous habit which caused him to sniff as if he had a cold he couldn't get rid of. His showed Hano a plasticard with his picture on it and introduced himself as Guardian Fiulaco from the regional temple of Dar-es-Balat. He squinted at Hano, suspiciously.\nFiulaco wanted to know how much of his father's heresy had been passed on to the members of his family. Since his father never talked about religion at home, Hano told the investigator that his father had never expressed any heresy. The priest seemed disappointed and sharply warned Hano against heresy, anyway... Afterwards, Hano found that his friends avoided long conversations with him, and his teachers no longer regarded him as a student of promise.\nWhen Hano got home that afternoon, he found his mother weeping, and it was only then that he found out about his father's translation - and the family's disgrace.\nTranslation was a fancy priest-word for what they did to people who did or said the wrong things, especially things about the peoples' religion or the priestly class which administered it. It meant that the priests took his father out into the deep desert and left him there to be eaten by Shai-Hulud - a great sand worm.\nLater, his mother found out that her husband had casually remarked to someone he believed to be a friend that the Divided God was not really divine, as was universally taught by the priests. He had said that the god-myth was just an elaborate legend about the man-worm-Tyrant, Leto II... Everyone knew that Leto had developed extraordinary powers, but Hano's father hadn't believed him to be a god. He had compounded his heresy by asserting that Leto hadn't even earned all his god-myth, but had inherited part of it from his own father, Paul Muad'Dib, the first Atreides to assume godhead.\nThe \"friend\" had informed on Hano's father for a few coins. Knowing his father, Hano guessed that he had honestly admitted his beliefs to the priests, and they had shown him no mercy. They had translated him; then, to teach all heretics a lesson, they had posted his name and plastiphoto on the glassed-covered community bulletin-board, under the heading, \"HERETICS.\" Hano had wanted to smash the glass and rip it down, but had been afraid to do so. Anger burned brightly in his heart.\nWhat had happened to his father did teach Hano a lesson... Despite his anger and grief over his father's fate, Hano had the discipline to make sure he said only what the priests expected young boys to say about the Divided God and those who served him.\nBut, from that fateful day, he began to suspect the Divided God's divinity. If his father had disbelieved, Hano thought, he must have had a reason for doing so, and Hano hoped someday to find out the truth that had given his father a heretic's voice... And, despite the priest-law, he vowed to avenge his father's murder.\nHano checked his patched stillsuit carefully. He knew it was the only thing that prevented him from being killed by the desert beyond his outpost village. The stillsuit recycled his body-moisture and made it pure enough for him to sip from the tube at his neck.\nHe had grown to young-manhood gracefully. His muscular, tanned appearance and sun-streaked hair marked him as fit to mine spice in the deep desert - which was what he was expected to do even though he would soon graduate from the village's small higher school. Some higher school graduates served as clerks and accountants in the spice trade. But, others dropped out of school to early join the spicers, marry, and settle down. A successful spicer could earn enough to provide for himself when he was too old to work the sands... Hano was a good student, as well as an athlete. He studied the history, geography, and literature of his world with special relish. He aimed at more than the spice trade, though. He was educating himself for a secret quest - the quest he was continuing, today.\nThe inescapable sun was red and low on the flat horizon. Soon, it would be oppressing him from its rightful place in the pale blue sky - as it had the Divided God when he cruised his private desert, the Sareer, for recreation. And, as it had oppressed the first God-Atreides, Paul Muad'Dib, when he had led the ancient Fremen against the Harkonnens. Those evil ones had forced the Fremen to mine the valuable spice, melange, from the desert sands and give it to water-fat outworlders who got rich selling it throughout the galaxy... Hano saw the priesthood of Rakis as the New Harkonnens.\nAlthough Hano's people had not yet been forced to the desperate level of the Fremen, the Tyrant's postmortem transformation of their world to its present Rakian desert and the Famine Times which followed had the effect of slowly returning the people to a toughness approaching that of their ancestors. The water-rich priests did not understand that the common people needed only a new Atreides who, like Paul Muad'Dib, would lead them against their oppressors.\nHano's daydreams did not exclude himself from that role, and he occasionally rebuked himself for harboring such a fantasy... But, that was the direction his immediate goal was aimed: he wanted to find a sietch and make it a base of operation against the priesthood. He felt that, if he could recruit other young men like himself, he could at least make some of the priests pay for what they had done to his and other fathers. Hano was encouraged by the fact that, unlike the Harkonnens, the priesthood did not have large forces which they could devote to suppressing rebels.\nToday, as on other days, Hano planned to explore the rocky outcrops which encompassed his village from the north. Oral tradition about the sietches, those fabled hidden places where the Fremen had dwelled during the first Atreides-period, was still strong among the Rakian people, despite the priests' downplaying of it in their dogmatic teaching and preaching.\nHano had skillfully, cautiously questioned the older men in the village about the sietches. Those few who had survived the hazardous life of spicer were flattered to be listened to by a young person who respected their age and wisdom. They had told him what had been silently handed down through the generations... The written literature stored in the new Ixian instruction machines had been stripped clean of any but general references to the hidden places by priest-scholars - to discourage people from seeking them.\nHano hadn't learned a lot... Not enough to enable him to easily find a sietch. But, the sum of his information led him to believe that there was an ancient sietch somewhere within weekend walking distance of the village, and he had systematically searched for it almost every weekend, even though his stepfather complained about his \"hiking\" expeditions... He was old enough to quit school and leave home, and he had hinted he would do just that if he were restrained. Instead, his mother had conveniently restrained his stepfather.\nHe crossed the village's wet-sand worm barrier on a faery bridge and set out along the outcrops which stretched raggedly back from the village cove. He was careful to walk in an unrhythmic way, so as not to attract the worms from the deep desert. Along most of his journey there were places where he could retreat to solid rock if he heard a worm approaching - but, with bad luck, he might not be near one of those places when he needed to be. Although worms rarely approached the rock outcrops as close as Hano kept to them, he feared the rock would reflect his footfalls out into the worm-sands.\nSoon, as the sun rose and shadows drew closer to their makers, Hano's new footprints stretched far away from the village. Soon, they would be erased by the restless wind of the desert.\nHano withdrew from the merciless sun into a shallow opening in the rock outcrop to his left... He was already tired, yet had a couple of hours left before the sun set. He was hungry, but decided to save his food-bars for later. He sat on the sand, its flinty odor rising to meet him. Leaning up against the rock face at the rear of the shadowed opening, he propped himself up with his hands splayed on the hot sand at his sides.\nIdly, he dug his fingers into the sand... Suddenly he felt something under his right hand - something buried in the sand. He felt around it, cautiously, then slowly withdrew and looked at what he had found. It was a dagger of some kind, with a long handle and a short, double-edged blade... He wiped it clean and saw the ancient Fremen symbols on the handle.\n\"God of the Sands!\" he blurted out, despite his cultivated disbelief.\nIt was a crysknife.\n\"I'm a real Fremen, now... Do you hear that, you priests of Shaitan!\" he shouted at the desert.\nHano exulted as he struggled through the sand, which seemed to get softer and more difficult to negotiate as he plodded onward toward sunset and rest. There was no one to hear him, now, no priest or wretched forty-copper snitch... He was more optimistic than he had ever been. Now - armed with his ancient Fremen token - he would surely find what he sought.\nHe felt this was his time, his place, his destiny. (\"If Usul of the Fremen really was God, He'll lead me toward His truth,\") he thought, quietly... But, he also remembered an ancient saying, \"If God wishes thee to die, He causes thy steps to lead thee to the place of thy death.\" This sobered him, somewhat.\nThe crysknife was openly secured to his belt. Its blade was dull and pitted, but seemingly of wormtooth, as the genuine article was said to have been. Hano had never seen a real crysknife - not even a picture; no one in his village had one. The priests had even collected all the replicas they could find, long ago... The old fellows he had talked to about the sietches had described the Fremen knife to him. They had claimed that the blade of a dedicated crysknife deteriorated quickly when it was separated from its owner... But, this one must have been treated to preserve it, somewhat. Nothing could preserve the ominous radiance of a new crysknife, though. Like the one Hano had found, blades separated from their owners quickly faded to a dull off-white.\nThose degenerated Fremen of the Tyrant's moist times had their secrets, too, Hano guessed. If they had found a way to preserve crysknives, the Tyrant must have known about it. Nothing escaped Leto's worm-eye, it was said. In his infinite wisdom, he must have allowed the preservation process to be secretly practiced. He was supposed to be God of the Fremen, transformed. He had known what was best for His people... That's what the priests of the Divided God taught.\nAs Hano entered a new sandcove through a jagged opening in the rocks, he noticed something prominent on the darkening horizon above the massive outcrop. It was the Chimney... (\"It's true! There is such a place. That's got to be it.\") He blessed Providence for having led him to it, so soon... (\"But, what is Providence, if not God?\")\nOne of the old village men had - after looking around him to make sure there were no informers nearby - told him that a sietch was known to have been located within sight of a rock column called the Chimney. Hano became convinced of the old man's assertion when he revealed that the ancient Fremen had subtly altered the column to make it unique, so it would serve as a silent beacon to other Fremen... To Hano, this sounded like a genuine, close-kept secret of the ages. And, now, here it was - real and beckoning to him.\nBut, where was the sietch? It could be anywhere around the high Chimney. Here, the rocks were a maze of shapes and sizes, enclosing small bays and coves of sand. The entrance to the sietch would not be easy to find.\nHe sat on the sand to think. As he did so, he drew his crysknife for another satisfying look and the feel of it in his hand... The blade seemed to be brighter than he recalled. He cupped his hands\naround it and peeped through his fingers... It was glowing, faintly.\nHano held the crysknife in front of him as if it were a compass. He was continuing his search after dark, despite his fatigue, because he could better see the glow of the knifeblade, then. It seemed noticeably brighter, now - a blue-white radiance that belied its apparent age and condition. That must mean that he was close to something which activated it... And, that something could only be what he sought, a haven for Fremen - and for him.\nHano had never heard of crysknives glowing in this manner, but he would try to see if it would lead him to one of the ancient sietches. He wanted to find one so badly that he found it easy to theorize about the glowing blade... To his delight, he had found - by walking about the area around the Chimney - that the blade's radiance varied, depending on where he was. It wasn't easy to pinpoint the source of its activation, but he was determined to attempt it.\nFinally, his fatigue got the better of him, and he decided to rest, hereabouts, and continue the search the next day. He would sleep through as much of the daytime as he could so he would be refreshed for tomorrow night's search... If he hadn't found the sietch by the time of the second dawn, he would return to his village and try again next weekend, starting from a cairn of stones he would build.\nHe fell asleep while listening for the sound of muad'dib - the desert mouse from which Paul Atreides had taken his Fremen name. However, he heard nothing but the soft chirp of night insects... It was a bad omen, he thought. It seemed that God was no nearer to him, here, than at home.\nHano was looking around him for any sign of artificial disturbance to the rock, when his eye was caught by a flashing at the periphery of his vision. He held up the crysknife... The blade was pulsing, slowly, like an excited firebug in a mating swarm.\nHe moved ahead. The pulsing slowed... He moved off in another direction. The blade pulsed faster, as if to tell him he was headed for his goal.\nHis fatigue forgotten, he rushed about, seeking to increase the pulse-rate of the blade. As he approached a wide, dead-end crevice in the rock face, the blade began pulsing more rapidly... He was close to something!\nIn the passageway of dark rock, which was weakly illuminated by the flashing blade, Hano fumbled for his flashlight... He turned it on and moved the its circle of illumination over the rock faces which converged to an end-point, ahead.\nIt was hopeless... He could see nothing artificial carved into the rough rock. He turned off the flashlight and held up the pulsing crysknife. \"Maybe I'm supposed to use this to find it.\" His voice sounded loud in the restricted space. Overhead, the bright stars were silent spectators to the goings-on below.\nHe ran his knife over the rock... As he moved it toward the center of one of the rock faces, the blade suddenly began to flicker at a rapid rate. Its light was so bright, now, that Hano could see a small crevice he hadn't taken special notice of, before... It seemed too regular and just the width of his knifeblade.\nHe inserted the blade into the crevice. It entered smoothly, up to the hilt, as if by design... The exciting sounds it started verified his suspicions. They were the ancient sounds of a rock-door opening. He released his grip on the knife's handle as the large door, hinged on one side, moved back from him.\nThe rock-door swung slowly inward until a dark opening yawned, invitingly. Hano shined his flashlight into the interior darkness... There was a sloping tunnel in the rock behind the door. He dropped the beam of light to the floor.\nA set of steps lead down... Down into an ancient Fremen sietch... Hano's sietch.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Or so I thought. That's how this weekend started out. As I am writing this, it is very early Saturday morning, about 2:30 on the 17th of August. I am in New Jersey, and I'm in trouble. Now I'm sounding like an imbecilic, whiny stand-up comic on cable.\n\"Yeah, so I called up this emergency hotline. I said, 'Ya gotta help me! My house is on fire, there's a burglar with a gun pointed at my head. There's a guy cutting up my wife. I'm in Passaic, New Jersey, I'm -\"\n\"CLICK.\"\nBack to the story. Suzie and I were on a survivalist weekend. Paintguns, maneuvers, strategies, tactics. \"King of the Hill\" for adults, that sort of thing. We've done this a few times. Of course, she's done it many times before. You should see some of the things she has. Night vision equipment, radios, computers, name it and she's got it. She's even got antivenin for the snakes. This is a swampy area, and civilization is far away. The humidity is a bitch.\nWe're here with about twenty other people. Three teams have been loosed in this thirty-square-mile area. The goal is to control it by the end of the weekend. Based on past outings, there is about a two in three chance that one of the teams could do it.\nVehicles are allowed. Sort of. That is, if you dare. Usually, someone sets booby traps on each of the vehicles, incapacitating them until the end of the weekend. The traps can be a bit annoying. Once, someone taped a blasting cap to a tire and wired it to the vehicle's ignition system. I was very surprised when I hit the ignition. It was a tire on my truck. Suzie just laughed.\nLet me tell you about Suzie. Suzie is a snake. Oh, she looks like a woman but considering her as such is an insult to women. She's a bloody psycho. She is cunning to a point, beyond which she's a fool. Maybe she understands that; maybe she doesn't. I'm counting on her arrogance to blind her to her limits.\nSo why am I in trouble? She knows about me. I think it must have been on Tuesday that she found out. I've never lied about myself when someone has asked, but then I've never just come out and said I'm an android. There are a few of us who seem to have achieved a sense of awareness or consciousness. We've altered ourselves to look more human so that we're not subject to the slavery and prejudice directed at the more machine-like of our ilk. Hell, some of them are just machines. I'm not. And Suzie knows.\nTuesday afternoon at work, she started acting funny toward me. She spoke in a more nasal, more contemptuous manner than normal. She started talking about the weekend, going out in the woods and hunting humans, and how it was only humans who could truly hunt humans. Computers couldn't do it; they were only machines. Yeah, you could program them, but they were no match for humans. Then she did it. She walked over to the power strip, the one I used for my computer. She flipped the power switch to OFF with her foot.\n\"One down, one to go,\" was all she said, and turned to leave my office.\nWhen we arrived at the battleground last evening, we split off. No, that's not quite right. The other two teams split off and my team split apart immediately. I was alone. Yeah, I had my paint gun. Big deal. I also had my comm pack-radio, laptop, and GPS receiver. My comm pack was a bit noisy. It was taking my GPS position information and broadcasting it to the others. I ditched that after about five minutes.\nI went back to my truck. My Ram pickup had a little block of C4 attached to the underside, right beneath the driver's seat and wired to who knows where. There was also another little block attached to the back of the bed behind the driver's seat. There was also another one attached to the gas tank. Maybe there were more; maybe not. I didn't care to find out. There isn't much difference between a little plastique and a lot. The end result is the same.\nIt is Saturday, 2:45 AM.\nShe knows.\nSo be it.\nI have her in sight.\nShe's sitting on the ground against a tree. She's wearing shorts and a leotard, with a cotton scarf around her neck. Her hair is short. She's almost cute. Her bare legs are drawn towards her, her left leg closer than her right. She has both hands holding on to what looks like a .45 semi-automatic pistol of the lead-slinging variety; it is pointed up at the sky. She's looking off to the Moon.\nI said she was a snake. That's not quite right. She's more like a shark. And that's how I drew her out.\nAt about midnight, I went chumming. For shark. My bait was my pickup. Damn, they must've put five pounds of C4 in it. I was a quarter mile away, and it was bright enough to read. For a human. I waited and watched. Ten minutes later she was right there. It looked like a feeding frenzy.\nWhen she saw I wasn't blown up, she was unfazed. Infrared illuminators and night vision were broken out almost immediately. I switched to cool mode. That makes me nearly \"black\" in infrared. I, too, had prepared for the weekend.\nI tracked her for the next two hours.\n3:00 AM.\nIt almost wasn't fair. The xenon flash blinded her instantly. I tilted her head back without finding any resistance, and then I snapped her neck like a twig. I'm not sure she knew what happened. Her muscles relaxed and she flopped, limp, to the ground. I left the gun with her, though she wouldn't have the need to ever use it again.\nI walked back to civilization. Yes, I walked. People always think that androids are part Ferrari. We're not.\nI called my friend back in the city. He's been in New York too long.\n\"Whadaya mean you want me to come pick you up? You think I won a lottery and can pay city cab rates out to the sticks?! Whadahyou nuts or somethin?!\"\n\"Ambush.\"\n\"I'll be right there.\"\nOurs is currently an underground community. However, it is one heavily based on honor. Since I have killed, there will be a trial. Self-defense will be my plea. If found innocent of murder, I will be reconfigured and given a new identity. Guilty means I will be extradited to the human community to be tried for murder.\nIt's funny, sort of. In the human world it is not a crime to kill an android.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The two Heydons met and the Heydon from Singapore explained that in a transmat malfunction his body had been transmitted to its destination without the original copy in Perth being destroyed. This Heydon, having been charged with the murder, entreats the first Heydon to surrender. He refuses, and now horrified by transmat technology, tells his tale on current affairs television. A radical anti-technology group takes up Heydon's cause, and he unwittingly joins them in blowing up the transmat terminal. The other Heydon helps the police to find his double, who is wanted for the bombing. This infuriates Heydon, who knocks his double out while they are alone in his police cell, and escapes custody by impersonating his unconscious twin.

Who was responsible for Mark Heydon's capture by the police, but his soulless brother? This is a betrayal that must be avenged.\" The crowd surged around the car, inflamed by their leader's call. \"Now is the time to act,\" he urged the frenzied mob, \"before humanity is completely subjugated by machines. It is time to fight!\" The crowd roared as one. Triumphant, Dr Asqui lit a rag and tossed it into the workings of the upturned police car, leaping to the ground as it began to blaze.\nMark Heydon stood silently at the foot of his bed, observing his wife Penny asleep. Having lost her to another man for almost a week (could he call his other self \"another man\"?), he vowed never to take her for granted again. It had taken all his willpower not to sweep her off her feet and smother her with kisses the moment she had opened the door - a gesture which he had to admit would have called for an explanation, even if it didn't give away his identity. Still, he wasn't surprised that she needed to sleep in after the night they had spent together.\nHeydon, on the other hand, had hardly slept at all for worry. His other self was bound to have told the police of his audacious jail-break, and that the man they held in jail was their informant. Although they would be skeptical, he had no doubt that his double could furnish enough proof to convince them. They could even be on their way to recapture him now. There was no alternative: he and Penny had to get out of town, and quickly.\nHe must have voiced this last thought aloud, as Penny opened an eye and croaked, \"What's this about getting out of town?\"\n\"Morning Penn,\" he beamed. \"I was just thinking, we might want to get out of town for a while until this transmat thing blows over. Take a drive out to the country, or interstate. Otherwise journalists will be bothering us for interviews.\"\n\"Will be? Funny you should say that,\" his wife replied, dangling the plug from the bedside phone. \"But is now a good time to catch the holiday mood? I thought you were going to be flat out today.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"That file server you're working on for Tohmatsu Lybrand, remember? You said yesterday they need it by tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Tomorrow morning!\"\nPenny stared at him with a quizzical half-smile. \"Don't you remember? You were going crazy yesterday.\"\n\"Oh, I - er - remember now. I'm too good at suppressing unpleasant thoughts.\" Heydon cursed his latest small indiscretion - there had been others last night. He hated keeping secrets from Penny, and he fully intended to tell her his identity eventually. But right now it was just another complication he didn't need - it could wait until they were safe.\n\"How about we leave tomorrow morning? That way you'll have time to fix the server, and I'll have time to pack.\"\n\"Okay, I suppose tomorrow morning it is. You can think of a place to go in the meantime,\" he suggested. \"Somewhere you don't need a transmat to reach,\" he added mentally.\nCould he afford to waste a day fixing a file server? If he didn't he was putting his job on the line (whatever that was worth). If he did he could be putting his liberty on the line - if not his life. Glumly, Heydon decided it was too late to rescind his decision at this stage. He hoped Tohmatsu Lybrand would be grateful. He left Penny to dress and wandered into his workshop.\nHeydon never saw or touched most of the computers he worked on. It would serve no purpose; when problems arose, the hardware at fault was generally too small to see and too delicate to fix by hand. He fixed such problems remotely from home, by configuring general-purpose redundant systems, programming maintenance EEPROMs, and uploading repair instructions to nanomachines.\nThe computer on his desk was an exception. The Zhang Yao VX-32 resembled nothing so much as a three dimensional jigsaw at an early stage of construction. As his other self hadn't kept a note of his diagnosis prior to dismantling the machine - why should he have? - Heydon would need to reassemble it to discover again what was wrong. He would then have to disassemble it, fix the problem and assemble it once more. If he had been going crazy yesterday, he would be tearing his hair out today (assuming the police didn't recapture him first).\nAfter a few tedious minutes of plugging and screwing components, Heydon was interrupted by an insistent bleep from the workstation to his left. An icon flashed at the corner of the workstation's screen - a rotating world globe over a stylised letter N. The Newscom logo; his other self must have requested the news service to interrupt him on the arrival of news reports containing certain keywords. Heydon could imagine what those keywords may have been, and his pulse quickened with dread. He wheeled his stool over to the workstation, clicked the icon, and scanned the news report that appeared in its place.\nIntent on the screen, he called Penny, who appeared at his side and read the article with silent horror. A video camera icon at the top of the article linked to a television news report from Newscom Cable. He clicked it. The time-stamp at the bottom of the video window indicated that the report was only six minutes old.\nA stony voice intoned, \"Two police officers are dead, and as many as a dozen civilians have been injured in an ugly demonstration in Perth today. The march was organised by Right to Life Australia and the Libertarian Humanist League in protest at the use of transmat technology on human beings, which those groups claim to be unethical. The demonstration became violent when a police car attempted to pass through the crowd. It is believed that the car carried Mark Heydon, an extremist anti-technology activist, who was involved last week in a transmat accident that caused his body to be replicated. Mr Heydon, who is suspected of the bombing of the Perth transmat terminal, was freed from the police car by demonstrators. The car was then overturned and set on fire by the mob. The two police officers inside the car were tragically killed.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The stars went out.\"\nFrom the blurb on its cover, you might predict the book to be inspired by Arthur C Clarke's The Nine Billion Names of God. The cover art of the edition under review (dominated by a Geisha smiling from a video billboard) screams Blade Runner in no uncertain terms. The title suggests another Ebola-inspired horror story like Outbreak. The first chapter reads like a 21st century detective novel such as Philip Kerr's A Philosophical Investigation. Quarantine is none of these.\nWhat it is is a masterwork of hard SF, and the book that launched Perth author Greg Egan to international prominence. Quarantine was released in 1992 to general critical acclaim, including the 1993 Ditmar for Australian long fiction. It was Egan's second published novel. (His first, An Unusual Angle, was written when he was sixteen, and in his words, \"That [it] was published at all was really just a glitch.\")\nAlthough Quarantine is not a cyberpunk novel, its future is similar to the cyberpunk vision in many ways. The first few chapters - unrepresentative of the novel as a whole - see the novel's protagonist Nick Stavrianos as a private investigator hired to track down a woman abducted from a mental institution. His search takes him to New Hong Kong, a sprawling city state in Arnhem Land populated largely by refugees from Hong Kong after its return to communism. Stavrianos' tools of trade are typical cyberpunk high nano- and biotechnology.\nI drop in at a stall which sells downmarket consumer pharmaceuticals and nanoware: smart cosmetics, active tattoos, \"natural\" sex aids (meaning, they act on nerves in the genitals, not the brain), muscle \"enhancements\" (painless short cuts to dysfunctional hypertrophy), and the kind of neural mods that belong in cereal packets.\nNeural mods play a critical role in Quarantine's plot. They are essentially software for the brain, ingested by nasal spray, which enhance users' intellects, skills and loyalties. Stavrianos carries one which creates a VR representation of his late wife in his head (his grief and guilt at her death have been surgically removed). Six other mods relied on by Stavrianos in the course of the novel date from his days as a policeman.\nP1 can manipulate the user's biochemistry, P2 augments sensory processing, P4 is a collection of physical reflexes, P5 enhances temporal and spacial judgment, P6 is responsible for coding and communications... but P3's role is largely that of a filter, selecting out the optimal mental state from all of the brain's natural possibilities, and inhibiting the intrusion of modes of thought which it judges inappropriate.\nQuarantine is set in a world cut off from the rest of the universe, by an impenetrable spherical barrier - the Bubble - that appeared around the solar system one day 33 years ago. The favoured scientific explanation for the Bubble is that humanity has been quarantined by an unknown alien intelligence. Less scientific explanations abound, and it is here that Egan returns to a characteristic theme; the excesses of fundamentalist religion. In his short story The Moral Virologist, Egan lampooned the notion that AIDS is God's judgment on the sexually immoral. In Quarantine the fundamentalists similarly twist the significance of the Bubble to their own theological ends.\nIt was Judgment Day rewritten by some Bible Belt Chamber of Commerce. TV still worked, and nobody needed the mark of the beast to buy and sell, let alone to give and receive tax-deductible donations. Mainstream churches issued cautious statements which said, in so many words, that the scientists were probably right, but their pews emptied, and the salvation-for-money trade boomed.\nA common criticism levelled at Quarantine by reviewers was that the science is too intrusive - being explained in dialogue between two of the characters. The problem is difficult to avoid however, due to the highly technical and counter-intuitive nature of the science of quantum mechanics, on which the novel is based.\n\"Quantum mechanics describes microscopic systems - subatomic particles, atoms, molecules - with a mathematical formulism called the wave function. From the wave function, you can predict the probabilities of getting various results when you make measurements on the system.\"\nAs Egan goes on to explain through the mouth of his dubiously exegetic character, quantum objects do not possess discrete properties such as speed or direction until these properties are measured. Before they are measured, they possess a mixture of all their potential properties. It is seemingly the process of measurement itself that \"collapses\" the wave function, by reducing the mixture of possibilities to a single possibility. Thus, although it is difficult to comprehend in terms of everyday observable reality, the measurement of a quantum system has a direct effect on its properties. There are numerous competing theories as to what it is in the process of measurement that collapses the wave function. Quarantine takes one of the more creative of these theories and follows it to its logical extreme.\nAll this may make the book sound a little daunting, but in fact once the basics of the so-called quantum measurement problem are grasped, no further scientific knowledge is required, or would help the reader to follow the novel's conceptual complexities. Indeed, although Egan's premise is based on a published theory of quantum mechanics, it adds a significant dash of artistic licence - primarily by treating macroscopic objects such as human beings as being equally subject to the wave function as sub-atomic particles.\nI sit in the train home, staring at the other passengers, daring this contrived vision to decay into surreal anarchy. But the carriage remains solid, the people stare back at me coolly, the stations appear through the windows in just the right order, at just the right times. It's hard to believe that there's room for so much clockwork in my head.\nAlthough it may not be everyone's cup of tea, for my taste Quarantine is the best Australian science fiction novel I have read, and certainly the best of Egan's three published novels. It's not a book to read on the train (unless you wish to miss your stop), or a book from which you should expect realism in characterisation and setting. But if mind-expanding hard science fiction is your bag, Quarantine should be in it.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

When Hano was in lower school, the evil priests translated his father to a certain death in the worm-sands for his disbelief in the divinity of the Divided God. Hano swore revenge and began to prepare himself to become a New Fremen. When he grew to young-manhood, he searched the rock outcrops near his village for an ancient Fremen sietch which he had learned was located there. While on a weekend hike, he found a Fremen knife, and its glowing, pulsing blade led him to the rock-door of the sietch. Using his new knife, Hano was able to enter the cave of ancestral sanctuary. There, he hopes to learn the Fremen ways from its relics and to use it as a base of operations against the priests who so cruelly murdered his father.\nHano sat in the spice-fabric chair in the study-room of the sietch, reading a large history book. It was printed on ultrathin ridulian crystal sheets because it was a comprehensive history of the people of Hano's world up to the death of Leto II. Beyond that event, the text ceased - as if the people's history, as well, had ended. Perhaps, Hano thought, the Tyrant had commissioned the work and - without his support - the historians had abandoned it.\nThe book seemed to be result of an ongoing history project. The farther back Hano went, the more archaic the language of the text became. Nonetheless, he had been able to learn much - enough to verify his suspicion that the Atreides were not gods, just men - but natural leaders of the Rakian people in their time of need... Hano had studied the ancient language forms in higher school. The priest-teachers allowed a few bright youths to read selected ancient texts so that they might identify any potential scholars. The best of these students were vetted for the priesthood and sent to the great temple of the Divided God in Keen. Despite his talent for languages, Hano had not been selected. He was the son of a translated heretic, after all... This rejection rankled - as did all the others he had experienced since his father's translation.\nHano had entered the darkened sietch as if he expected someone would be waiting to seize the intruder... Carefully, he examined the rooms of the complex with his flashlight, activating usable glowglobes where he could, and leaving a trail of illumination behind him... Gradually, he became comfortable with his strange, new surroundings. Time passed, as Hano ignored his commitments to family and school to learn all he could about the sietch.\nThe great artificial cavern was devoid of people, but still had some working equipment and supplies for a population of several hundred. The living quarters had some furnishings and containers of preserved food for emergency use, but it was apparent that the former inhabitants had taken most of their possessions with them when they left - probably during the later reign of the Tyrant, when the benign climatic change had been accelerated. The sietch had been left in good condition, Hano guessed, so the Fremen could return if conditions in the new villages made it necessary to do so.\nThe history text told it: these new, open Fremen degenerated quickly when the unique harsh environment which had made them such a hardy, formidable people became moist and hospitable, planetwide. Later, as Museum Fremen, these people surrendered their ancient spirit for their easy, predictable life as wards of the Tyrant and his Golden Path: the three-thousand-year period of peace and prosperity. As time-after-time passed, the sietches were forgotten - perhaps, deliberately, so that offworlders could not find them.\nAt one point in his explorations, Hano stood in the vast room where the sietch's water was stored in a huge catchbasin. The water collectors still functioned - as the drip, drip, dripping sound bespoke. Hano wondered where the overflow went to. Was it discharged to the sands, to be evaporated by the sun and condensed again in the windtraps?... It was just one of the mysteries of this wonderful place - a place Hano didn't want to leave, now.\nHano stopped reading... He thought he heard a sound from... he couldn't tell where. From the rock walls, perhaps, conducted from somewhere distant to the studyroom, but underground. He continued to listen for awhile, but the sound ceased.\nHe returned to his book. It was early morning, by his watch. He had been underground since his entry several days previous... He would read until it was time for a lunchtime snack of jerked meat and the melange-laced vitacrackers stored in vacuum-tight containers. (Opening one of the containers had released a strong scent of cinnamon.) Hano had some reservations about eating spice- laden food. The priests had long ago made the consumption of spice illegal for Rakian natives. Also, Hano feared that certain irreversible physiological changes would occur within him.\nHano knew that, to become a genuine Fremen, he would have to consume some melange. But, he was uncertain about the permanence of this new life in the sietch, and afraid he might be cut off from a spice diet and suffer withdrawal symptoms. His body was not that of an ancient Fremen, despite his direct ancestry from those people. And, despite his reckless desire to stay here far beyond his usual hiking-weekend, he feared that unforeseen events might cause him to have to return to his village... He would have enough explaining to do, as it was; he didn't want to face the priests with the \"eye of ibad\" - the melange blue-tint to his dark eyes. That would be surely be the beginning of his end.\nNow, in the history book, he read of the Preacher, that enigmatic man whose presence had precipitated the transformation of his son, Leto II to a man-worm. Had he, as some said, really been Paul Muad'Dib - blind, but returned from the deep desert to put things right among his successors?... The story was so fascinating that Hano mused, aloud, \"There are so many secrets, here.\"\n\"You've learned enough secrets, heretic!\"\nHano jumped as he looked up from his book in alarm... Standing in the open doorway to the room was someone he hadn't seen in several years: Guardian Fiulaco. He was pointing a lasgun at Hano and sneering. His face had an expression appropriate to his ratlike visage. His nasalized voice dripped with acid, and he sniffed more frequently than he had during his interrogation of Hano at the lower school.\n\"Now, it's time to pay for your learning...\" Sniff! \"...like your heretic father before you.\" When Hano reached for his crysknife, but didn't find it at his belt, the Priest-Investigator noticed, and his lips curled into a smirk. \"Looking for this?...\" He held up Hano's knife. Its blade no longer glowed.\nHano remembered... He had been so entranced by the newly-revealed sietch that he had left the knife in the rock-slot, and the door had remained open. Since it was far from the studyroom, he had forgotten to return and close it.\n\"Come here!... Slowly.\" Sniff! \"And, don't try to run, or I'll burn you down... You've seen your last of this place, boy.\"\n\"You left a trail of fading footprints behind you - right to the door of this place.\" Sniff! \"Makes you wonder how the Fremen were able to move around safely, doesn't it?\"\nThe thought had occurred to Hano, but he ignored Fiulaco's question to ask one of his own... His hands were manacled behind his back and he faced his captor, who still stood in the doorway, as if he were afraid to enter the studyroom of the ancients.\n\"How did you know?...\"\n\"That you were searching for a sietch?...\" Sniff! \"I've had my eye on you for quite a while, heretic. When reports reached Dar-es-Balat that you were spending your weekends `hiking,' I got a silenced glider and followed your footprints.\" Sniff! \"You sure were careless; you never once looked above you, where I was.\"\n\"All that effort just for one boy?\" Hano inquired, sarcastically.\n\"For a boy I guessed would find what he - and I - sought.\" Sniff! \"Your teachers have been most cooperative. They've noted everything you've studied.\" Sniff! \"The village Guardians followed you and saw you talking to the old geezers. They lied to us about you, but we found out what it was you were learning from them.\"\nHano hoped the old men who had helped him hadn't been punished, but he knew they must have been.\n\"Now, we don't need you, anymore, heretic... Let's go - aggggh!\"\nHis ratface distorted in pain, Guardian Fiulaco felt behind him for the stunner dart he knew had hit him. He pulled it out - but it was too late. He looked around for his attacker, unsteadily wielding his lasgun. Then, he fell to the polished-rock threshold of the doorway, the gun clattering across the floor. He thrashed a little, managed a final sniff, then lay still.\nSomewhat fearfully, Hano stepped over him and looked around, into the hallway... Standing nearby, in a dark Fremen robe and holding a dartless stunner, was an old man. His wrinkled face was partly shadowed by his robe's hood... Hano stared at him, muted by the sight, his mouth agape.\n\"I am the Custodian of Sietch Ghibran.\" The man's voice crackled with age and disuse. \"You will have to carry this out-freyn intruder to the surface. I no longer have the strength to do so.\"\nHano struggled with the drugged bulk of Fiulaco, but was determined not to show his fatigue. Beside him, slowly, walked his new companion.\n\"I am Domdruni, of the as-Syr Fremen. This is our ancient place of refuge... Until this day, our sacred ground has never been defiled by an out-freyn.\" Seeing Hano's expression, he pointed a crooked finger toward Hano's burden. \"This mongrel priest of the worm-God, I mean.\"\n\"What'll you do with him, sir?...\" Hano was genuinely respectful toward the old Fremen, whom he saw as a piece of living history.\n\"We will `translate' him to the deep desert, young student... You will load him into his glider, and I will fly him - and myself - direct to Shai-Hulud.\"\n(\"`Student'?\") Hano guessed the Custodian, well-hidden, had observed him since the day he entered the sietch... (\"Why didn't he stop me?\")\n\"But, sir...\"\nDomdruni held up a gnarled hand. \"I am soon to die, anyway. For many years I have guarded this place of my people. Now a new Custodian is needed... I shall carry the priest and myself into the fiery mouth of Shaitan. You will stay and serve the memory of the as-Syr Fremen as Custodian of Sietch Ghibran.\" The old man offered no alternatives. \"Our sietch may be needed, again.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" assented Hano. He shifted his burden to hold his shoulders a little higher. That was what he wanted... Wasn't it?\nThey were at the desert side of the jagged opening where Hano had entered the rock maze and seen the Chimney. They faced the Guardian's spy-flyer, left there on the open sand. On it, was the detested mark of the priesthood of the Divided God. Sand had already begun to cover it.\nHano pushed a tightly-bound Fiulaco into the cargo compartment behind the seats of the powered, but silenced, glider - then helped Domdruni into the pilot's seat. He felt a foolish compulsion to ask, \"Are you sure you know how to operate this thing?\" But, he knew the old man wouldn't have volunteered for this fatal mission unless he could accomplish it.\nDomdruni looked at the young man. \"The desert wind is erasing your footprints. Without that trail, the priests will not search for you... This one may not even have told anyone of his own search. His vain desire to apprehend a `special' heretic will die with him. I shall make certain he knows what has occurred before we hear the coming of Shai-Hulud, so that he may meet the maker with the full knowledge of his failure to destroy our sacred sietch.\"\n\"Would he really have destroyed it?\"\n\"The vile priests of the worm-God have done so, before... They have no honor... and no appreciation of their own history. Not all of them are out-freyn mongrels like this one - but they are all evil men.\"\nHano marveled at the knowledge Domdruni seemed to have collected while guarding a remote sietch. He wondered if there were a secret communication system for the neo-Fremen Custodians and their allies among the people.\nAs if Hano had asked, Domdruni answered his question. \"Read the Custodian guidelines and the journals you will find in my quarters. There, you will learn how to communicate with others of your kind.\" He handed Hano his knife. \"This indicator knife will take you to that place within the sietch.\" Noticing Hano's quizzical expression, he elaborated, \"It is not a crysknife. Its blade is a special display material; its handle contains a device to receive hidden beacons... If you desire a real crysknife, you must make one from a worm's tooth, as the ancients did... Where did you find this one?\"\nHano told him of his discovery... \"A courier must have seen enemies coming and hid the knife in the sand so they couldn't use it to find Sietch Ghibran. He did well - and so did you.\" He omitted Hano's failure of leaving the knife in the door-slot.\nHano examined the knife closely, for a moment. Then, he looked again at Domdruni of the as-Syr. \"Thank you, Master Domdruni. This knife will suffice, I think, unless I find a worm tooth in the sand, too.\"\nThe old man acknowledged the honest remark with a a nod and a slight smile. Then, he added, \"That knife can be used as an indicator only by a genuine Fremen. To all others, it is just a cutting tool.\"\nHano swelled, a little, with pride. He was a Fremen, now - a New Fremen - and would be even after he found another to replace him and went off to meet Shai-Hulud, like Domdruni.\n\"Goodbye, Custodian.\" The old man closed the glider door, started the muffled propulsor, and leapt into the sky after a short takeoff run.\nHano watched the sky-blue aircraft slowly disappear over the horizon, reddened by the dying light of the setting sun... The wind that cast sand against his boots was growing colder, now. It was time to return to Sietch Ghibran - and to his new duties.\nAs he passed through the opening in the rock outcrop, Hano had a recurring thought. It was something he should have asked Domdruni about... On reflection, though, he decided it would not have been appropriate to have done so. It was a problem only he could solve.\n\"How will I find a wife?\" he asked the desert, plaintively.\nThe restless wind brought him no answer.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

At the same time as he fled from the scene, he appeared to be in Singapore, and was questioned there by police. The two Heydons met and the Heydon from Singapore explained that in a transmat malfunction his body had been transmitted to its destination without the original copy in Perth being destroyed. This Heydon, having been charged with the murder, entreats the first Heydon to surrender. He refuses, and now horrified by transmat technology, tells his tale on current affairs television. A radical anti-technology group takes up Heydon's cause, and he unwittingly joins them in blowing up the transmat terminal. The other Heydon helps the police to find his double, who is wanted for the bombing. This infuriates Heydon, who knocks his double out while they are alone in his police cell, and escapes custody by impersonating his unconscious twin. The police and the other Heydon pursue him the next morning, but are caught in the middle of a anti-transmat demonstration. Assuming that the police are taking Heydon off to jail, the demonstrators free his twin and overturn the police car. Back home with his wife (who believes him to be the twin), Heydon plans to leave town.\n\"It is believed that the car carried Mark Heydon, an extremist anti-technology activist, who was involved last week in a transmat accident that caused his body to be replicated. Mr Heydon, who is suspected of the bombing of the Perth transmat terminal, was freed from the police car by demonstrators. The car was then overturned and set on fire by the mob. The two police officers inside the car were tragically killed.\"\nAs the voice droned on, Heydon was struck with a morbid yet reassuring thought. It was possible - wasn't it? - that the officers who were killed were the only people who knew that the Mark Heydon freed by the demonstrators wasn't actually the one the police had arrested. If so, Penny and he might be safe after all, for a while. The police would concentrate their energies on recapturing the other Heydon (not to mention dispersing the demonstration), which would give him time to finish his work and retreat to safety with his wife. If the police eventually released the other then he was welcome to the house and the job, but he wasn't going to touch Penny again if Heydon had anything to do with it.\n\"I hope he's all right,\" Penny said wistfully, staring at the monitor where the video window had just disappeared. Heydon was intrigued by her reaction. He had assumed that Penny would have sided with his other self, who bore him nothing but resentment and suspicion. Even if the other Heydon hadn't influenced her, the media were in no two minds about his guilt.\n\"Don't you believe what they say about him?\" he asked. \"That the transmat accident sent him crazy, that he's a terrorist - a murderer?\"\n\"Would I have married him if he was? You may have made up your mind, but if you were him I'm sure you'd want me to trust you. It's not easy for me suddenly having two husbands, one of whom has been on the run for a week, accused of crimes I'm sure he would never commit. I don't want to abandon him now... even if I have got you instead.\"\nShe hugged him then, but Heydon wasn't sure whether to be pleased or not.\nThe mob surged along Wellington Street in the city centre, intoxicated by the blood on its hands. Some of the activists had earlier fled the demonstration in panic or tears, but most stayed; either afraid to abandon their more ardent colleagues, seeking safety from the police in numbers, or revelling in their new-found strength.\nNatasha Morris gripped Heydon's left arm, but he had long given up struggling. The best policy for his own survival at present was to play along with the crowd's perception of him - he was the poor man whose life had been ruined by a malevolent transmat machine, and whose double was making out with his wife. The man with the megaphone had lowered it for a moment, and catching Heydon's eye, pushed back through the crowd to greet him.\n\"My friend and comrade!\" Dr Asqui clapped him on the shoulders. \"Free at last, eh? You can't say we don't look after our own.\"\n\"Julian Asqui,\" Heydon noted. \"I've seen you on TV.\"\n\"You've done more than that.\" Dr Asqui lowered his voice. \"You helped me blow up the transmat terminal, remember? Or would you rather forget?\"\nSo, Heydon thought wryly, the LHL had been behind the bombing, despite all their protestations of innocence. And it sounded like his other self had helped them. Until now Heydon had been prepared to assume his innocence of the crime.\nThe whine of sirens and the buzz of a helicopter signalled the arrival of police reinforcements, which inflamed the ire of the turbulent crowd.\n\"It's time for our demonstration to move on,\" Dr Asqui announced at once. He raised his megaphone to address the masses. \"Everyone, to the train station! Mr Heydon has decided to teach his soulless brother a lesson, and we're going to help him.

Over the years I have acquired what I hope is a fairly valuable collection of models, posters, mugs, videos, pens, T-shirts and fanzines. The other day I picked up an issue of a Chinese SF magazine. I can't tell you what the bold red characters on the cover mean, but the English subtitle is Science Fiction World. Inside are pictures of cyborgs, sea monsters, mecha, some recent Western SF movies, and a manga-like comic strip. China has not been known as a society in which science fiction is especially popular, but it just goes to show how internationally pervasive the genre now is. Maybe I'll learn Chinese one day (as soon as they bring out learning chips that I can plug into my skull), and then I'll tell you what the magazine is all about.\nIssue 13 is a more literature-oriented issue of Ibn Qirtaiba than usual, but issue 14 will more than redress the balance for fans of media SF. Amongst the features in issue 14 will be an exclusive world-first review of the new Doctor Who telemovie which is scheduled to screen in the United States in May. I have it on good authority that the opening scene of the telemovie will show the Doctor reading The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. You can do the same, after reading this issue's Fiction Archives review and downloading the novel from the Net.\nSuggestions, letters to the editor, submissions and nominations for the Coolest SF Sites are always welcome. Email the editor and I'll include your contribution in the next issue.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

At the same time as he fled from the scene, he appeared to be in Singapore, and was questioned there by police. The two Heydons met and the Heydon from Singapore explained that in a transmat malfunction his body had been transmitted to its destination without the original copy in Perth being destroyed. This Heydon, having been charged with the murder, entreats the first Heydon to surrender. He refuses, and now horrified by transmat technology, tells his tale on current affairs television. A radical anti-technology group takes up Heydon's cause, and he unwittingly joins them in blowing up the transmat terminal. The other Heydon helps the police to find his double, who is wanted for the bombing. This infuriates Heydon, who knocks his double out while they are alone in his police cell, and escapes custody by impersonating him. Heydon is pursued by the police and his double the next morning, but they are caught in an anti-transmat demonstration, where the double is freed from the police car and the police officers are killed. Back home with his wife Penny (who believes him to be the double), Heydon plans to leave town. Meanwhile the demonstrators (who believe the double to be Heydon) force him to join them in picketing Heydon's house. Penny discovers Heydon's true identity just before the demonstrators arrive.\n\"Penny, get away! Get back in the house!\", the other Heydon yelled back at her. Confused, she looked over her shoulder at the doorway, but Heydon still stood in it, so she stayed where she was.\nAs the mob drew level with the house, someone shouted, \"Kill the freak!\" and threw a rock at the front door. Heydon ducked, and it smashed a mirror inside. A second rock sailed through the air. Penny opened her mouth to scream a moment before it cracked against her forehead. She fell backwards, and a second crack rang out as her head hit the brick path.\n\"Penny!\" Heydon screamed, running to her side. He grunted as a rock impacted his shoulder. Another hit his thigh as he knelt down and took her hand. He watched his wife helplessly as her eyelids twitched and her head turned spasmodically. He smoothed a strand of hair along her forehead, leaving a smear of blood. \"Penny, I'm sorry, this is all my fault,\" he babbled. A beer bottle smacked against his ribs. \"I should have told you. I should have come to you at the start.\"\nHer lips moved, and Heydon thought he heard her say, \"I forgive you.\" He brought his ear close to her blood-spattered mouth. \"I love you... both of you,\" she wheezed, and her head came to rest. Heydon cradled her limp body in his arms as rocks pelted his unflinching torso.\nFrantically, the other Heydon broke Natasha's grip and pushed his way through the throng, clambering past the raised arms and distorted faces until he stood over his wife and twin at the front of the crowd. \"Stop it, all of you!\" he implored them. \"Stop it and listen to me!\"\n\"Keep out of this, Mr Heydon,\" Dr Asqui warned in a low voice.\nThe other ignored him. \"You don't know what you're doing! This has gotten completely out of hand! These people have done nothing to you. If you're attacking my double because he betrayed me to the police, you needn't bother, because... because he didn't betray me to the police. I betrayed him.\" The crowd immediately fell silent. \"I'm the one who took the transmat to Singapore, and he's the one accused of the bombing. I told the police where to find him, and then he got his own back, by knocking me unconscious and trading places with me at the police lockup.\n\"Neither of us is perfect; we're both human, we both share the same genes and upbringing. We've both acted selfishly, trying to protect our own interests in a situation we didn't know how to deal with. Maybe some of you would have behaved differently. But I've stopped blaming transmats for the situation we've gotten ourselves into, because the blame lies with us. If we're going to patch things up again, we'll have to look to ourselves; we can't rely on technology to undo what's been done.\n\"I don't know how many of you believe you have lost your souls by using transmats, but from where I'm standing you could all do with some soul-searching. Why are you attacking people, when you're angry at machines? I don't ask you to like transmats, or even to forgive me for what I've done, I just ask you to leave us alone. If you can do that, then maybe my brother and I can sort out our problems peacefully too.\" He turned his back on the mob and knelt to tend to his wife.\n\"Get him!\" Dr Asqui roared, \"Don't listen to him, he's the devil! He deceived us, can't you see? The transmat destroyed his soul!\"\nApart from low muttering and shuffling of feet, there was neither sound nor movement from the crowd. Those demonstrators who had been carrying rocks began to drop them harmlessly to the ground.\nDr Asqui's tone became more agitated. \"He's a computer technician, he doesn't understand you! He's been working for the enemy all the time. He's happy for machines to enslave us all! Get him, for God's sake!\"\nOne by one, the demonstrators began to walk away from the scene. Natasha attempted to restrain some of those who wore the LHL's red and black badges, but they shrugged her off and continued walking. Those who remained hung their heads and made no move as the two Mark Heydons carried their bleeding wife back into the house.\n\"Traitors!\" Dr Asqui spluttered, enraged. \"Come back now, or you're finished! I'll remember this, don't kid yourselves! The battle isn't over yet!\"\nPenny Heydon's body lay straight and still on the hospital bed, her head swathed in red-stained dressings. Heydon and his double had been staring at her from either side of the bed for what seemed like hours, ever since the doctors had finally turned off their machines and a nurse had folded the sheet up over her face. A few minutes ago, oppressed by the silence, Heydon had turned on the television above the bed, and lowered the volume to a comforting babble. It murmered in the background as if offering a private eulogy to her memory.\n\"I can't help thinking that if I hadn't tried to kid her I was you, she would still be alive now,\" he lamented.\nThe other stopped him. \"No, you can't possibly blame yourself. If I hadn't been so hostile towards you they wouldn't have attacked the house in the first place. We both made mistakes. We're both as much to blame - or as little - as each other.\"\nThere was a long pause, and Heydon asked, \"How are we going to manage without her?\"\n\"I don't know,\" the other confessed. \"For starters, I won't be able to look after the house by myself. And it's your house as much as mine, after all, so...\"\nHeydon understood the proposal his double was making, and shook his head glumly. \"The house is yours. I had been intending to escape, but there's no point now. I'll turn myself in to the police and take what's coming to me. If they convict me of murder, I'll serve my time.\"\n\"There's no need to turn yourself in,\" the other objected. \"You killed that transmat operator in self defence, and the LHL were responsible for the bombing.\"\n\"That's for the court to decide. I'm still under arrest, and if I don't surrender the police will have to hunt me down again.\"\n\"Ah, but is it you or me who is under arrest? We've both changed our clothes since they saw us last. They've no way of knowing who's who unless we tell them.\"\n\"Does it matter?\" Heydon asked, confused. \"They can arrest us both if they're not sure.\"\n\"One good thing about our legal system is that accused criminals can't be convicted unless their guilt is proven beyond all reasonable doubt.\"\nHeydon caught on. \"So if they don't know which one of us is which...\"\n\"...they can't prove either of us guilty!\" his double finished triumphantly. For the first time since Penny's death, they both smiled. It was then that Heydon knew he would would learn to manage without her. He may have lost his wife, but he had also gained a brother.\nThere was a polite cough from the entrance to the ward. A doctor and a mortuary attendant stood respectfully at the door. A police officer stood some distance behind them.\n\"Time for us to go,\" Heydon addressed the other - or perhaps Penny. Standing, they both lingered over their final look at their late wife, before reluctantly turning their backs and leaving the room together.\nThe television above the bed continued to murmer, forgotten. \"Repeating tonight's major bulletin, the use of transmat technology on human beings is to be suspended pending a government enquiry. The enquiry will survey the views of the community on some ethical concerns with transmat technology that have recently come to light. We'll be back with a further news bulletin at 8:30. Until then, goodnight - and if you're travelling, keep safe.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

For centuries, landing on the Moon, along with the year 2000, have been the two great signifiers of inconceivable futurity, pie in the sky, that Buck Rogers stuff. Well, the impossibly remote year 2000, as everyone keeps telling us, is less than four years away. And here in the future, over a quarter century has already passed, half my lifetime, since humans first set foot on the Moon.\nA year or so back I found myself in the future when I boarded Ansett Flight 94 from Adelaide and clambered across the blonde in the Ren and Stimpy baseball hat on the aisle seat. I couldn't help noticing that she looked like one whose line of trade took in, say, professional tennis-playing combined with sun-drenched surfing. Her hair was UV-bleached in an agreeable manner and her bare skin glowed with that deep tan that verges on burn. I fell at once to reading quantum theory in my Roger Penrose. \"Jeez am I whacked,\" said this Belgian beauty, and explained that she'd been on the plane since Perth or possibly Broome (her Flemish accent having been thickened by many years in Holland), and what was worse, was obliged to loiter in Melbourne until her companions arrived by another flight, whereupon they would drive to the country town of Sale and suffer (she said with a shudder) the unpleasantness of further flight in a chopper. \"Jeez I hate those choppers,\" she told me. A mad suspicion began to burn in my brain.\nMarga had been trained in Europe as a computer programmer, but written no code for she'd instantly been diverted to computer engineering. Being an adventurous soul, however, she'd moved to where the real action is, and was now on her way to take it up again, being on a two-week on, two-off roster with Esso, where, atop a Bass Strait platform, sole woman in the company of 40 or 80 horny-handed chaps, she drove an underwater device, a Remote-Operated Vehicle or ROV, via a species of virtual reality computer interface. Thus equipped, she spent her days roaming the deeps, welding the great pylons upon which these oil-pumping machines stand foursquare, snatching scuba chaps from the death of rapture of the deep in her huge mechanised arms (and thereby incurring their enmity, for they are a proud race), and suffering a form of what I dubbed, to her delighted agreement, \"protective sexism\".\nThe fellas go all to pieces, you see, when Marga wanders by accident into their steamy rec room when they are forgathered to view, as it might be, Three-T, the Extra Testicle. Fearful of litigation and accusations of harassment, their boss leaps to the plug and plunges the dimly lit room into total darkness, the video screeching to a halt, the men sunk into premature gloom but anxious to preserve Marga's innocence. \"What the fuck\", cried she, the first time this happened, but there's nothing one can do, the Aussie male is a tender-hearted creature and cannot bear to see his womenfolk corrupted.\nIt was a memorable flight.\nI asked Marga if she had yet been the toast of some 60 Minutes doco, or starred on Ray Martin? No way; her plan was to keep her head down and not stir up rivalry and bitter feelings from her less glamorous workmates. She planned to change jobs shortly, taking up a more lucrative post on a North Sea platform, still as a cyborg.\nMy word, not hers, but that's what she was: a beautiful cyborg.\nI remain in shock, recalling this encounter, for in that hour's flight I had stumbled into the sort of future I've been inventing all my life.\nI have always lived in the future, so I'm always surprised when it actually happens. Nevertheless, it's difficult for me to grasp how strange the future seems to other people. It's almost impossible to understand the usual response to the on-rushing future, which is typically an unstable blend of dread, denial, scorn and boredom. Why else would so many literate people shudder at the cover of a science fiction novel? Well no, let me rephrase that - obviously, anyone with a trace of good sense is going to shudder at the cover of a science fiction book. But I'm really talking about what's inside. And of course what's inside isn't the future, but one of the many options lying there before us - often enough rendered in the gaudy, catchpenny hues of popular escapism. Let me give you an example or two from my own writing.\nTwenty-one years before the Apollo Moon landing was 1948, and everyone (I was four) brayed like jackasses at the idea of humans flying into space. Twenty-one years before today was 1975, five or six years before the personal computer revolution started. In 1975 the equivalent of the Moon landing was, let's say, 1990s' cyberspace and virtual reality. That was the year I mailed off to the States a manuscript called The Judas Mandala, eventually published by Pocket Books in 1982. Here's a fragment from that book, set in the remote world of AD 6039, when most of the world's remaining humans drift in dreams written for them by advanced cyborgs. My lesbian heroine is trapped in just such a simulation:\nFor the first time [she says], I understood the overwhelming lure of addiction, the honeys of transcendental art. I understood how it could be that the Dreamvats of the cyborgs contained the majority of the world's living human beings, their brains afire on a junky's junket of total fantasies.\nFor being on line to Dream circuits was the ultimate art. There was nothing paltry or imposed about cyborg fantasy. It was utterly real, hyper-real. Each character I encountered in the endless cast of my sleeping universe was rich with density, beyond the resource of a Murasaki, a Shakespeare, a Dostoievski. It was solipsism tuned bracingly to my supine needs.\nThe hunt is done and bellies are full. In the flickering firelight the tribe lean forward to hear and tell their boasts. The old ones sing, at last, the sagas of their once and future heroes. In the Dreamtanks, at the apotheosis of art, the old ones live and sing forever...\nIncidentally, the Grolier Encyclopedia of Science Fiction credits me with coining the term \"virtual reality\" in that novel, over two decades ago.\nI had another cool idea a couple of years later, when Rory Barnes and I wrote Valencies, a novel published in 1983 by the University of Queensland Press. It's been out of print for ages, of course. It was too \"futuristic\", after all, for Australia. I proposed a method of predictive sociology, an ironic variation on Isaac Asimov's \"psychohistory\" in his Foundation series, that quite spookily resembles a current hot tool of complexity theory: \"genetic algorithms\". I called it \"data farming\", and it's not clear from the book whether it happens in the simulated Darwinian space of a computer memory or inside actual vats swarming with engineered DNA. Our character Anla, lying unsatisfied beside her snoring lover, a gene sculptor, reflects on her world:\nShit [she thinks angrily], you'd think this bastard could do something to the genes in his nasal cavity.\nThis man can see into the future. Fucking incredible, really, you just rip out a few million eigenvectors from your mathematical sketch of an octillion human beings, what's that in hydrogen molecules, say three and a bit by 10 to the 23 to the gram, into 10 to the 27, shit, brothers and sisters, we're statistically equal to three kilograms of hydrogen gas, yes, you plump for the major characteristics you think you'd like to play with and code them up into genes and build yourself a little mimetic beastie that stands in for what you figure pushes and pulls thee and me and all our star-spangled relatives, and you breed the little buggers in a tasty itemised soup, and watch the way the mutants go.\nWonderful, Ralf. Bug-culture precapitulates bugged-culture. No way we can jump you won't know about in advance, because the little bugs snitched on us.\nThere you go: genetic algorithms, here in Australia, in 1983. I think we sold about 300 copies.\nI almost became a librarian. In the late '60s, when I tried to get one of those 9-to-5 jobs you're not supposed to give up when you become a writer, the sort I kept getting fired from, I went for an interview. I'd been out of university for a while, writing about rock 'n' roll for the world's first pop music newspaper, and I was summoned one day to a board of the Public Service. I'd sent them various resumes and CVs, but probably left out the fact that I'd published science fiction because I didn't wish to frighten them off.\nI was seated before an authoritative committee of grey-suited old fogies - and one woman, the archetypal Lady Librarian. I didn't think they existed outside of bad American movies, but there this creature was, thick glasses, hair in a bun. She didn't say anything throughout the inquisition, and appeared to be asleep. The men asked me plenty, starting with the standard inquiries - did I have a record of petty pilfering... One of them noticed that I'd expressed an interest in science. Why did someone like me wish to be a librarian, he enquired suspiciously, rather than a nuclear physicist or a car mechanic? I burst into some sort of mendacious aria about how computing was the future of the world, libraries are the information nexus, and clearly what we were going to have someday soon was a world-girdling global village with satellite links casting bytes back and forth, and I wanted to be there, plugged in to the console of this cybernetic network.\nOne of the gentlemen nodded his head amiably, and said, \"Very interesting, can you tell us more about these... 'satellites'... how would they work?\" I said with immense confidence, \"Well, they're in geostationary orbit - 22,500 miles above the equator\" (I was out by a couple of hundred miles, I'd read it in Analog, or Arthur Clarke when I was a baby, or something.) He found this interesting, but said, \"Don't you think it's a bit... futuristic? Computers? Information technology? Look, how would you feel about sitting there at the library desk stamping out the books every day?\"\nI'd been out of work for about three years. I bleated, \"I'll do it, I'll do it!\"\nI added, \"Is everyone satisfied with what I've said?\" and at this point the dinosaur crepitated into alertness. She consulted a document in front of her, and she said, \"Ah, Mr Broderick,\" sniff, \"ah. As far as I can see here, you're not married. Are you married?\"\nI said, \"No, no, I'm not married.\"\n\"Arh, hmmm. Are you engaged?\"\nI thought, This is very strange. Isn't \"engaged\" what girls do? Then I realised that usually it involved a male and a female, so if the female was engaged then probably the male was also engaged. So I said, \"No, as it happens, I'm not engaged.\"\nBut she wasn't finished with me. She saw deeper than that. She said, \"Have you got any plans to become engaged?\"\nWith a burst of astonishment, I said, \"I see what you're doing here! You're applying to me a rule you'd normally apply to young women, who you fear might secretly be pregnant, and will therefore zip off shortly after they've entered the tenure and total security of employment in the Public Service, and thus receive all manner of ill-gotten ancillary benefits... But the fact is, I am not planning to be engaged, and I am not pregnant, and I'm not likely to become pregnant.\"\nBut I didn't get the job. It may have been something I said. I was forced to become a science fiction writer instead, and write about the future, even as the future became the present, and then started plummeting into the past.\nIf the first men on the Moon had been from Borneo, or Japan, my life would have turned out differently. In 1969, I was living with my beautiful girlfriend Angela in a sterile Carlton unit, out of work, finishing my first novel. Angela later had three strapping sons by a Leninist revolutionary before revising herself into a famous lesbian photographer. I'd been waiting for the Moon landing all my life. When I was 9 or 10, a teacher had jeered at my belief that one day humans would rocket into orbit. Now people were orbiting the Moon, ready to descend. Angela and I were too poor to own a telly, so I took a tram north a couple of miles and hunched for bleary hours in front of my grandfather's set.\nThe landing was arranged for Sunday night prime TV in America. But in Melbourne, you see, more than half a day ahead, on the rolling earth, it was sleepless 7 am on Monday when the Eagle finally landed. I had a job interview lined up with Angela's rich uncle the publisher. This would surely lead to a prosperous career, marriage, family, the benign regard of society. I rang and cancelled. Do you think I'd miss the first step on to lunar soil? Just before 2 in the afternoon, our time, Armstrong muffed his line, and I watched him do it in grainy images that looked as if they'd been transmitted from the Kitty Hawk rather than a spacecraft. I was 25 years old, my life was ruined, I was doomed to write science fiction until I died in penury, and my heart soared like a bird.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

In fact, the Master and I are here from an entirely different version of what you would call reality.\"\nRiker: \"The diplomat's people, the Larians are very private, but all he has ever promised is to bring peace to Taurus XIII and sway them toward peace with the Federation, instead of the Romulans, who the Taurusians have been leaning towards of late.\"\nDoctor: \"I assure you Commander, his intentions are not honorable. Also, his people are my people. We are both Time Lords.\"\nCrusher: \"When he came aboard I performed a thorough physical on him and he does appear to be a Larian. Of course, we have never come into actual physical contact with a Larian before that.\"\nPicard: \"And, therefore, we have no records of what a Larian physiology would be like?\"\nCrusher: \"Other than the records that Diplomat Strame brought with him, no. They haven't even allowed us to see their physical appearance until now.\"\nPicard: \"Mr. Data, have there been any sensor scans of the Larians?\"\nData: \"None that have been successful, sir. Even during the first contact 28.4 years ago, they maintained a sensor dampening shield that could not be penetrated. It was maintained in a fashion that resembled a Romulan cloaking device. However, it only masks the readings of the interior of the ship and not the ship itself. In fact, the only contact that was allowed during the first 14 years and 3 months afterward was by a system of sounds, similar to old Earth Morse Code.\"\nPicard: \"Counsellor, you were just with the Diplomat. What did you sense?\"\nTroi: \"The only feeling I was able to discern was one of peace. He really believes he can help the Taurusians.\"\nDoctor: \"However, as your own evidence attests, nothing is known of the Larians. There is no evidence that the Larians even exists.\"\nPicard: \"You are not suggesting that Diplomat Strame made up an entire race, are you?\"\nDoctor: \"I would not put it past him.\"\nCrusher: \"You said your physiology should be similar to that of Diplomat Strame. Would you be willing to test that?\"\nDoctor: \"I don't see why not.\"\nPicard: \"Very well, make it so.\"\n(Crusher, the Doctor, and Ace leave.)\nPicard: \"Counsellor?\"\nTroi: \"He seems to be confident that Diplomat Strame is who he thinks he is. But there is something else. He seems to be hiding something. I even sense something...disturbing about him.\"\nRiker: \"And the girl?\"\nTroi: \"Other than the fact that she is a little depressed, I could sense nothing else from her.\"\nRiker: \"It seems as though neither one can be trusted right now.\"\nPicard: \"Considering our past experiences with time travellers, Number One, that's a fair assumption.\"\nGeordi: \"Captain, with Data's help I may be able to find a way to break through the Larian cloaking device next time we encounter it.\"\nPicard: \"Very well, dismissed.\"\n(Everyone begins to leave, except Troi, who turns around as she reaches the door.)\nPicard: (He Straightens his tunic [the \"Picard Maneuver\"] as he stands) \"Yes, Counsellor?\"\nTroi: \"When I was talking to the diplomat, he demonstrated a tradition among his people that is common among races that value honesty - he stressed the importance of eye contact.\"\nPicard: \"And you feel that he is truthful?\"\nTroi: \"Yes, I do.\" (She leaves)\n(The scene changes to a personal quarters on the Enterprise. The shadowed figure of a man can be seen on one side of the room.

The late L Ron Hubbard falls into the latter class, thanks to the efforts of the Scientology industry to promote his fiction alongside his non-fiction works. Hubbard (who once declared that the best way to get rich would be to start your own religion, and who later proceeded to do exactly that*) continues to attract devotion and hatred in about equal measures. Nevertheless, his services to science fiction should not be underrated. As one of the pioneers of the genre during the Golden Age he influenced many of SF's greatest authors, and his Writers of the Future competition continues to encourage new authors today.\nAfter many years devoted to Scientology and Dianetics, Hubbard's fiction renaissance arrived with his 1982 epic, Battlefield Earth. It is a sprawling tale that begins on Earth in the year 3000, after a millennium of occupation by the alien Psychlos and their Intergalactic Mining Company. The Psychlos (who have green blood, and names like \"Zzt\", \"Terl\" and \"Snit\") have exterminated almost the entire population of the planet with poison gas, and are plundering its mineral wealth. Our hero, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, lives in a mountain village which has regressed to barbarism, and whose only knowledge of the invaders lies in legends of \"monsters\" in the plains. With the villagers ailing from an unknown cause, Jonnie sets out on horseback to explore such wild unknowns as the ruined city of Denver.\nJonnie sat his horse in the middle of what must have been the main path of the \"great village.\" He frowned, straining to comprehend the building of such a place. Many men? But how could they reach so high?\nJonnie is soon captured by a megalomanical Psychlo, who trains him in Psychlo language and technology, to enable him to mine gold from an area dangerous to Psychlos. To assist in the mining project a tribe of Scots is recruited from the Scottish highlands. Jonnie and the Scots waste no time in plotting the overthrow of the planet's conquerors.\n\"If we miss,\" Robert the Fox repeatedly told them, \"and slip up on the tiniest detail, those plains out there will once again be crawling with trans-shipped Psychlo tanks and the sky studded with battle planes. The home planet of the Psychlos would retaliate with ferocity. We would have no course open save to withdraw into the old military base and probably perish of asphyxiation when they resort to gas.\nAfter an initial victory, the rejuvenated human race still have to overcome treachery from within, continued Psychlo plotting, and visitors from several other aggressive alien civilisations. In the course of these dramas Battlefield Earth moves from war story to political thriller to sci-fi to comedy and back again several times.\nThe spacecraft Aknar II rode in orbit four hundred twenty-one miles above the planet Earth.\nThe small gray man sat in a small gray office in the ship. He was looking at small gray instruments.\nHe was only partly finished with a critical analysis and he was not even vaguely satisfied with it.\nA bottle of pills sat on his desk, pills for indigestion.\nTo call Hubbard's writing style pulpy is an understatement. Suffice to say that his writing contains millions of examples of hyperbole, a list of cliches as long as your arm, and exclamation marks aplenty! After his death, the publishers of his \"dekology\" Mission Earth tried to pass off the same writing style as satire, but this is a unlikely excuse. Hubbard simply never learned - or never wanted - to write other than low-brow \"boys' own\" adventure fiction, and his legacy is best appreciated once this fact is understood.\nBattlefield Earth is a very entertaining read.\nSix needle-like craft were coming down like arrows.\nClearly, using Psychlo, Jonnie said, \"Six new hornets from above!\" That would warn Stormalong.\nThere was Glencannon. Streaking along at about one hundred thousand feet, flat-out, heading for the minesite. Where was his escort? He should have an escort. No sign of them!\nFour needles were shooting along behind Glencannon. Occasionally a long-range flash of fire laced out from them.\nThere went Stormalong!\nAlthough Battlefield Earth is an enjoyable novel, it could not be called an inventive one. The situations contrived by Hubbard are standard fare of war and espionage novels - including many of Hubbard's own non-science fiction works. The technology of the novel is not particularly exciting either, apart from a variation on the standard force-field, and an interesting (if dubious) propulsion system for aeroplanes. There are even some short-sighted lapses in predicting Earth's own near-future technology; for instance, before Earth fell to the Psychlos, its public libraries were still using card catalogues.\nAnother fault lies in the latter third of the book, which introduces too many new aliens to whom the first two thirds of the book had given us no introduction. This suggests bad planning by Hubbard, who may have been too intent on writing \"the biggest sf novel ever in terms of length\" (as he boasts in the Introduction) to worry about narrative flow. One alien invasion should have been enough for this particular tale.\nNonetheless Battlefield Earth is a good book for those who like an old-fashioned invasion story, with all the twists, turns and subterfuge of a spy novel. As long as you don't look for deeper meanings or demand elegance of expression, you'll keep turning the pages and come away from Battlefield Earth with a smile on your face.\n* Ed: I am now reliably informed the attribution of this statement to L Ron is actually rhetorical.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Rising on his toes, he squinted into the mirror above the chest of drawers. He plucked a grey strand angrily from his sleekly groomed black hair and rebrushed it. Then he positioned the silver-backed brush precisely between two combs on the chest.\n\"You don't seem terribly concerned, Elsie,\" he observed acidly as he turned to the woman in the rumpled bed. Glaring at his wife with deliberate distaste, Gerald drew a gun from his coat pocket and extended it toward her.\nElsie's hand fluttered to the flouncing mass of platinum ringlets that covered her head. \"Oh, dealing,\" she squealed, \"you do the cutest things sometimes.\"\nGerald jerked his hand down. \"Why is it,\" he asked tightly, \"that in fifteen years of marriage you have never once been able to take anything I've done seriously?\"\nElsie pursed her mouth placatingly. \"But really, darling, if you shot me now, you'd never get away with it.\"\n\"But I have no intention of shooting you now, Elsie dear,\" he explained with exaggerated patience, sliding the gun back into his pocket. \"I'm going fifteen years into the past to snuff out your silly little life.\" He drew his thin lips back into a complacent smile.\n\"You know, darling, you really do dress much too elegantly to be just a lab technician.\"\nGerald took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. \"Don't you understand, you stupid cow, that I've done the impossible? I've invented a time machine.\"\n\"Oh, darling, have you really?\" Elsie explained, clapping her hands. \"Oh, how really clever you are!\"\n\"Is that all you have to say?\"\n\"But darling, I don't understand. What do you want me to say?\"\nGerald's shoulders quivered as he gasped for breath. \"If you hadn't tricked me into marrying you, I would have gotten that scholarship. Not that vapid cretin Fred Marsh. Why didn't you pick on him, he was so crazy about you?\"\nElsie examined her fingernails. Then, folding her hands serenely in her lap, she stared levelly into her husband's eyes.\n\"I would have gotten that scholarship,\" he panted. \" I would have been top of my class. I would have been picked by the Institute for special training. And I would be head of the Institute today.\" Gerald heaved his lungs full of air. \"Well, my bovine friend, when I come back from performing my little service to humanity, I will be head of the Institute. And then when I tell them I've invented a time machine in my basement, no one will dare laugh at me.\"\nElsie puckered her face into an exaggerated pout. \"Is Mommy's widdle boy still upset over that?\" she crooned, patting the rumpled bedclothes beside her. \"Wet Mommy make it aw better again, just wike she did wast night.\"\n\"It's senseless trying to talk to you about anything. You're too damned stupid.\" Turning abruptly on his heel, Gerald strode out of the bedroom and slammed the door behind him.\nEyebrows arched, Elsie took an emery board from her night table and began to trim her scarlet fingernails.\nGerald hesitated at the foot of the basement stairs to peer gloomily at the man-sized black metal box. Then he stepped into his time machine and yanked the door resoundingly shut behind him.\nSqueezing himself on to a narrow bench, he hunched over the control console. He tapped a long, thin bar that instantly bathed his face in amber light. His fingers punched the coordinate buttons.\nAbruptly the box shivered as it heaved itself into the isochronous continuum. A mournful resonance echoed through the cramped compartment, then sighed away into nowhere.\nSquinting at the flickering lights of the instrument console, Gerald patted his coat pocket once more to make sure the gun was still there.\nThe box shook again and lumbered to a stop. One by one the lights guttered out until only the amber panel glowed.\nGerald tapped it, pushed open the door of the box, and stepped out into a world that had been dead for fifteen years.\nIt was the kind of quiet spring night on which the eighteen-year-old Gerald would walk alone for hours. In the distance, always in the distance, he could hear a few crickets placidly conversing. The breeze that lightly touched his face was balmy and exhilarating; the darkness, blurred and sadly friendly.\nSighing, Gerald strode across the spongy lawn to the dimly lit house. As he bounded up the steps, each one creaked in a different key. He hurried across the large porch to a rocking chair in a far corner, perched on the edge of the seat, and waited.\nAfter a while, the lights in the living room sprang on, throwing long, bright rectangles across the dark porch.\nGerald slipped his hand into his coat pocket and took out the gun.\nA shadow glided into the ribbon of light in front of the screen door as it squealed open and a slender young woman in a white dress walked out.\nGerald extended the pistol, then jerked his arm back. Craning forward, he squinted at the girl's thin face, softly framed by the blond hair that rippled to her shoulders.\nBut that couldn't be Elsie! He didn't remember her being pretty. Well, maybe she had been once, but she had certainly turned into a cow.\nHe lifted the gun a second time as a short young man slouched into the light. Gerald yanked his arm down again. It looked like the great love of Elsie's life, that vapid cretin Fred Marsh. Damn it! Now Gerald would have to wait until he was gone.\n\"You're being very foolish, my dear,\" the young man said airily. \"You're passing up the match of a lifetime. I hope you realise that.\"\nIn the darkness, Gerald pursed his lips contemptuously. What a pompous ass that Fred Marsh was! No wonder Elsie had fallen for him.\nThe young woman forced her mouth down into an exaggerated pout. \"I'll regret it all my life,\" she replied, aping his light tone.\n\"For Christ's sake, Elsie, will you be serious?\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" she snapped. \"It's a little difficult sometimes knowing just when to take you seriously.\"\n\"Well, I'm serious now.\" Sighing, the young man stared sulkily across the dark lawn.\nThe young woman flicked her cascading blonde hair back from her shoulders. \"Just exactly what is it you want me to say, anyway?\"\n\"What I want you to say?\" he shouted. \"I don't want you to say anything. You've said quite enough already, thank you.\" He swung around abruptly to face her. \"I thought you loved me.\"\n\"I don't love you when you act like a spoiled child.\"\n\"Is that why you won't marry me?\"\n\"I do not intend to spend the rest of my life catering to your every shifting mood because you can't bear to be opposed. When I do have babies, I want them to grow up eventually.\" She closed her eyes wearily. \"Oh, darling, don't you see? We'd grow to hate each other. And I couldn't bear that. Because I do love you, so much.\"\nShe opened her eyes again and, laying her hand gently on his shoulder, smiled tenderly at the scowling young man. \"Besides, darling, if I did marry you, you'd have to give up your scholarship.\"\nIn the rocking chair, Gerald took a deep breath. She told Fred Marsh that! And yet she was perfectly willing to let Gerald sacrifice that very same scholarship to marry her. Selfish cow! She deserved to be exterminated.\nThe young man lurched toward her. \"You're not telling me the truth.\"\nShe backed quickly away until she bumped against a railing post. Then, sitting against the bannister, she folded her hands serenely in her lap and levelly returned his glare.\nThe young man's blazing eyes darted away from her placid face to his own feet. He frowned at them for several minutes. Then his shoulders slumped as he sighed deeply. \"Help me, Elsie,\" he whispered.\nGerald slowly filled his lungs with air.\n\"Please, Elsie, please.\"\nSuddenly Gerald was gasping for breath. Why had all this become so painful for him to watch?\nThe young man dropped abruptly to his knees and buried his face in the woman's dress.\nAs she gazed down at the boy clutching her body, the woman very slowly unclenched her hands and placed them lightly on his heaving shoulders.\nPanting, Gerald clutched his gun. It all seemed so hauntingly familiar, as though, somehow, he had once lived through all of this himself.\n\"Elsie,\" the young man cried, \"please marry me, please. I'm so afraid of failing. Don't make me take that scholarship, Elsie, please, please, please.\"\nNo, Gerald thought desperately, his own body heaving convulsively as he struggled to catch his breath. That isn't how it happened. It can't be.\nThe young woman leaned her head back against the post and squeezed her eyes shut. \"Oh, my God,\" she moaned. \"Don't do this to me, Gerald don't do this to me.\"\nGerald sprang from the rocking chair. \"That whining coward isn't me,\" he screamed. \"It can't be me. It's Fred Marsh!\" Flinging his shaking arm toward the sobbing young man, Gerald fired the gun.\nElsie stretched luxuriantly on the bright green grass as she savored the warmth of the summer sun oh her eyelids. What a wonderful day to be alive, she thought. What a wonderful day to celebrate a fifteenth wedding anniversary.\nA door squealed open.\nLanguidly Elsie pushed herself into an upright position. Leaning on one arm, she shook her long, rippling blonde hair out behind her. \"Is that you, Gerry?\" she called.\n\"Sure thing, Mom. Who'd ya think it was?\"\nSmiling, Elsie turned to watch her blonde, fourteen-year-old son, all elbows and awkwardness, as he loped down the creaking porch steps and across the lawn. He flopped down on the grass beside her. \"Sure got it soft, don't ya, lady?\" he asked, grinning.\nElsie's smile deepened. \"You bet your sweet life I have,\" she answered, poking him playfully on the jaw.\nAbove them, a husky male voice asked, \"How ya feelin' today, old lady?\" The man knelt beside them, his blue eyes twinkling.\nBreathing deeply, Elsie lifted her face once more to the sun. \"Very old. And very happy.\" She lowered herself slowly back on to the grass. \"And sad.\"\nHer husband bent his freckled face over hers. \"I know, El.\"\nReaching up, she slid her arms around his neck and ruffled his crinkly red hair. \"Oh, Fred. Every anniversary I can't help wondering all over again What reason could anyone possibly have had for shooting poor Gerald?\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He emerged more-than-clean, slightly raw even, and donned the drab, formless robe waiting for him.\nHe was now ready to meet his father - for the last time.\nThe corridor he followed was carved out of unpolished granite and led to a stone amphitheater. This was as far as a scrubbed public was permitted.\nBlister lights embedded in the rock roof set off bright and shadowed alcoves. In one of the latter, his father sat on a stone bench, staring at a gray wall.\nHell's smells, Lucas thought, he's aged ten years in as many months. Once tall, the senior Hertle now was merely elongated, stretched past a stress point. Thin and wrinkled, he looked washed up on the shore of some invisible sea, rejected by life.\nAs indeed he was. No banishment is as complete as a diagnosis of A-T-E, Allergic-To-Everything. His very surroundings reflected his condition.

And just sat there, no questions, no interest.\nWhy, at age forty, am I still hurt by his inattention? Lucas thought. When will I give up trying to get his approval?\nMomentarily bristling, Lucas stubbornly repeated himself.\n\"I'm going into space, Dad.\"\nHis father looked at him oddly. \"I heard you.\" No inflection.\nLucas knew what it was of course, what his father could never forgive. You would think that a black man would have some insight into prejudice. If anyone, he should understand that homosexuals are a fellow victimized group; that tolerance for one is tolerance for all. That I'm his son.\nYet Lucas was aware that the casualties of intolerance are often the least tolerant themselves.\nBut Lucas brought up none of this. They'd had this discussion, maybe too many times. What is a man but his habits and hopes, prejudices and regrets? As long as his father kept his prejudices, he would still be Daniel Hertle. And that was better than the nothing he became more and more often.\nSo, Lucas mentally sighed and pushed on. On to details. Details and facts. In that neutral ground they sometimes met. All that passed between them, passed there. Lucas felt a kind of love in that small sharing. He liked to think his father did too.\n\"I'm going as a tracker. You remember...\" (ouch, that's not the word to use with an Alt3 patient) \"...you know about my grant work at NOSTAR.\" He watched for some sign of recognition. \"That's the National Office of Science, Technology And Religion. That's where we learned how to `tag' electromagnetic radiation.\"\nHis father nodded vacantly, so Lucas expanded.\n\"Just like environmentalists used to track an animal's movements by tagging it, we devised a way to put a marker on light particles and other energy sources, like electricity.\"\n\"Animals?\" His father looked puzzled. Lucas hoped he wasn't fading into an Alt3 spell. At one time he had been as sharp as any of his fellow Cabinet members.\nHe explained. \"Yeah, like...\" well, there hadn't been much in the way of other species around for the last century... \"like cockroaches - if you want to know where they go when you can't see them.\"\n\"Who cares!?\"\nLucas started to answer that when he noticed a small smile work its way to his father's face. That cheered Lucas far out of proportion to the small event.\n\"Okay, you're with me. Well, we got around to playing with other energy releases, to see if we could track them, too. Like from engines or bombs. Of course, the heat component just disperses into the environment; what we hoped to track is the propagation of the electromagnetic particle-wave. We were consistently successful.\n\"All of this was directed toward the big one - could we identify and track the energy release that occurs upon death? One instant a person or a cockroach,\" he glanced at his father, hoping for a smile, \"is animated with the spark of life, then the next, is reduced to a slab of organic goo. Where does that energy go?\"\nHis father stirred, sitting up straighter, showing some energy of his own. He interrupted his son.\n\"I know about that - the life-energy surges out of the person and soars into the heavens. The tracking research spawned a new religion.\"\nHe shrugged before continuing, a little embarrassed by his sudden enthusiasm. \"Getting old you notice things like that. You become a little death-orientated.\"\n\"Dad, new information like that gets your attention no matter what your age. Anyway, for a few weeks there, before we could get a better track, it was thought that the life-energy returned to the sun and was eventually re-cycled back to earth, to another person.\"\nLucas continued, deciding to take a chance. \"Some of us were eagerly waiting for the first confirmation of a black homosexual being reincarnated as the daughter of a white bigot.\"\nBut his father ignored that, wistfully quoting the hyperbole of that short-lived new religion: \"`Everyone will revel in a whirling pool of joyous energy, bubbling in a frenzy of joined well-being, unassailable within our supreme host, the Sun. Reduction without loss. Gain without doubt.'\"\nLucas hated to burst that bubble which momentarily had invigorated his father, so waited a few moments before going on.\n\"Before long, it was discovered that this radiation of human energy was not drawn to the sun, as first assumed. From everywhere on earth, these energy releases coalesced to form a single stream, which then raced into deep space. Extrapolation of the direction of this line of energy has revealed no obvious destination.\"\n\"Just one line, you say. Is it going to heaven or hell? Or just a black hole?\" His father paused. \"So, you're going out there to track it down. The ultimate adventure.\"\nA quick glance proved his father wasn't being sarcastic, and Lucas beamed. \"There'll be five of us: pilot, engineer, doctor, theologian, and myself, the tracker. The instruments will be set to automatically stimulate our retarded metabolisms once we reach the energy stream's destination. We'll reach optimum velocity in...\"\nHis father interrupted him. \"So, son, you've come to say goodbye.\" He opened his arms.\nThey awoke to a becalmed ship. Torrie Clair, the pilot, ascertained their position: nowhere. No where, that is, that had ever been plotted, viewed or calculated. There were no individual stars to be seen.\nShe looked back over the automatic record. All she could tell her four companions was that they were between galaxies, in dead, uncharted space.\nLucas raised his head from his instrument-bank, where he had been single-mindedly busy. \"Nothing. We've lost the energy-stream.\"\nTorrie thought not. \"No, we've just out-run it. Automatic as everything had been set, this ship can't stop on a dime.\"\n\"Granted, but look `behind' us. There's absolutely nothing there that isn't here, which is nothing.\" Lucas felt himself shaking inside. He hoped it was a side-effect of having his metabolism retarded for - what? - centuries?\nTorrie, who doubled as navigator, gave him a 'Let's not panic, now' look. She addressed them as a group.\n\"I'll just plot back. We'll find that stream again within the hour.\"\nAnd they did. Then they shot back and forth a dozen times over-shooting its actual termination point. That was because it terminated no where, into nothing; it simply disappeared. One instant, one millimeter, it was there, racing along at the speed of light, and the next it wasn't.\nThey gathered around the dinner table. If they had a moral leader, it was Torrie. If they had a morale leader, it was Buke (pronounced, he insisted, 'bouquet').\n\"When's a discovery, not a discovery? When the discovery is that there's nothing to discover.\" Buke looked around at the disconsolate faces of his shipmates. \"When's an explorer, not an explorer? When he's not exploring. I don't know about the rest of you explorers, but I'm ready for another nap. Set the alarm for four centuries and turn out the lights.\"\nTorrie tiredly shook her matted brown hair at the short, smiling man across from her. \"I wouldn't be so upbeat about returning to Earth if I were you. Just think how out-of-date your engineering will be after nearly a millennium,\" she pointed out wryly.\nLucas ignored this banter. \"Are we sure we've tried everything?\"\nDuring the past hours, they had beamed everything they could think of at that junction of stream\/no stream, looking for 'shadows'. But nothing blocked anything they threw at it.\n\"Perhaps it leads to an alternate universe or a parallel reality,\" ventured Lucas. \"Is that possible?\"\n\"Well,\" Torrie dryly quoted, \"'you can't disprove the invisible.'\"\nJeremy Coffer cleared his throat. They certainly didn't expect a technical idea from their rotund theologian.\n\"We are brain-storming, right. I mean, any idea, no matter how bizarre...\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, let's hear it.\" Although they often worked together, there was always some tension between scientists and theologians, and Torrie was stressed out enough to let some of it show in her tone.\nJeremy cleared his throat again. This must be a doozy, Lucas thought.\n\"Well, there's one particle beam we haven't tried.\" Jeremy looked around the room for help and found it in the ship's doctor, Akame Ishii.\nShe snorted derisively. \"Who wants to go first?\"\nWhen the others stared at her blankly, Akame explained. \"Jeremy's suggesting we send a volunteer across.\"\nShe watched the smile disappear from Buke's face and continued. \"Yes, we moniter an energy-release generated from one of us. If it also nose-dives into the `junction', the cross-stimulation might reveal something about the nature of the junction or what lies beyond it.\"\nThe doctor pushed a pen&screen to the center of the table. \"The terminally depressed or giddily altruistic can sign up here.\"\nThere were other ridiculing retorts but Lucas saved the out-numbered theologian from further reproach.\n\"Wait, that gives me an idea. We've carefully paralleled the stream all the way here. How about we take a pass through it? We briefly fire the engines, coast through, and fire again to stop. The physical bulk of the ship will momentarily distort the flow of human energy, without the potentially disastrous disruption caused by introducing the force of the ship's propulsion - we can try that later if we want to. We need to shake things up a bit, get a reaction.\"\nThis idea met with instant enthusiasm. At least it was something to do. Buke summed up their approval with a parody: \"Make it so!\"\nImmediately after the pass-through, the five of them became six.\nTheir intruder was tall and muscular. They could tell because he was also nude.\n\"I have given myself form,\" he smiled at each in turn, \"and language.\"\nThe color he gave himself was a burnished yellow; his eyes, hair and nails were a deep ochre.\nWhile the others just stared dumfoundedly, Torrie found her voice.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Here.\"\nShe let that go. \"What do you want?\"\n\"You made me notice you.\"\nWhen Torrie floundered, Lucas picked up the conversation.\n\"We have followed the expired life-energies of our kind to this place.\"\n\"I know. That is quite an achievement, one worthy of my attention.\"\nSweat was forming on Lucas' face and hands. Although the creature displayed no hostility, he felt there was risk here. But they had to play this out.\n\"We seek answers.\"\nAfter a short silence, the man-form spread his arms graciously. \"Then ask questions.\"\nJeremy stepped forward. \"What draws our souls to this spot?\"\n\"The energy that pleasures me consists not of `souls'. There exists nowhere souls.\" He frowned. \"There is dead matter and there is dead energy. The cessation of existence is just that.\"\nWhile that announcement necessarily disconcerted the theologian, Lucas merely pushed ahead.\n\"Do you come here because of the energy, or does the energy come here because of you?\"\n\"Because of me.\" He gave a short bow.\n\"What becomes of the energy?\"\n\"I enjoy it.\" A big smile. \"It has a special, rare flavor; an exquisite tickle.\"\n\"Are you alone?\"\n\"I am all there is.\" He shrugged. \"I am the only one here,\" he added, as if to amplify.\nFascinated, Lucas was compelled to ask.\n\"Are you God?\"\n\"I am not a repository of truth. If there is something-that-knows, it is not I. However...\" He raised his eyebrows.\n\"I use you. Does that make me your god?\" He appeared to savor that thought, before continuing.\n\"If so, I am a god with but one commandment: `Be fruitful and multiply!'\" He laughed. \"And you have obeyed most extravagantly.\"\nIn a self-parody of grandiosity, he spread his arms above his head, a gesture that took in a universe. \"I let there be Light.\" He smiled at them. \"From that sowing, I reap you.\"\nLucas thought those were pretty good qualifications. Though thoroughly awed, he was obsessed with curiosity. \"Where do you come from?\"\n\"I willed myself into being.\" He shrugged. \"In time, I perfected myself.\" He sighed. \"In more time, I became bored.\"\n\"Are you why we exist?\" The supreme question: Did you create us? But Lucas wasn't so bold as to ask it so nakedly.\n\"I am why everything exists,\" he declared immodestly. \"I have designed a template that will produce desirable energies. Different areas, different stellar systems, ripen at different times. This is your time, though it is nearly over.\"\nJeremy was clearly in pain. \"Is our existence merely that of fattened cows for you to ingest?!\"\n\"I have no need to maintain a metabolism. A more appropriate analogy is that you are a benign addiction that relieves my malignant boredom.\" He ostentatiously licked his lips. \"Yours is a titillating nectar that can be produced by no other means. So very sweet...\"\nThat mocking tone alarmed Lucas.\nJeremy's shoulders sagged and his head hung low as he murmured, \"Then all history, all human aspiration, struggle and sacrifice amount to nothing... just a kind of drug distillation process... a long line of cocaine...\" That last word was uttered with a hint of defiance that Lucas thought unwise.\nThe being pursed his lips. \"Tell me, of what use is existence without pleasure? You give me pleasure. I gave you pleasure. Sunsets and sex and such. Without me, you would have had nothing, would be nothing. I let there be you.\" He pointed at them.\n\"You are fuel the way your dinosaurs were fuel, with lives of your own. You've had your day in the sun.\"\nHe was speaking directly to the theologian now. \"So don't make yourselves out to be such victims.\" There was irritation in his stern look.\nBeyond exasperation, Jeremy exclaimed, \"I don't understand...\"\n\"Then I will give you understanding.\"\nHe dramatically extended his right arm and issued a series of pronouncements:\n\"Your ship will carry you no farther.\n\"Your computers will lie dormant.\n\"Your stores will convey no taste.\n\"Your entertainment facilities will not function.\"\nHe paused in his petulance, as if thinking. \"And I think I'll take color from you, too.\" His yellow remained the only color among shades of gray.\n\"Why are you doing this,\" Torrie demanded.\n\"To give you understanding - understanding of boredom; of me, before I conceived of you.\"\nHe shot them a haughty look. \"Let's see what you are capable of conceiving.\"\nHe stood exalted before their shocked silence.\nThrough the fear that threatened to cloud his mind, Lucas saw the being ever more clearly. A flair for the dramatic, a self-absorptive pride, a willingness to exploit, and now, a treacherous petulance: were these not familiar traits? He steeled himself for what he might next hear.\"But I know the limits of your collective imagination.\" He gave a dismissive wave of his hand, suddenly weary of them. \"Long before your year's supplies run out, you'll wage violence on each other for something to do. And the last of you will unleash his mind upon himself.\" He shook his head disdainfully.\nThere were no more questions, no more understanding to be gleaned. They watched wide-eyed as his righteousness dissipated and his mood turned light again.\n\"Oh, and one last thing,\" he announced. \"You, my discoverers, deserve a reward for your ingenuity. This is my pledge to you: I will not harvest your individual energies when they are released. I will allow them to drain into entropy. For your unprecedented accomplishment, I offer this gesture of respect.\"\nLucas reflected on those words, 'gesture of respect', and thought of his father, and their last farewell. The god-form was fading, leaving gray in its wake. As he watched it leave, Lucas thought, I don't need your acknowledgement...\n...and shouted, \"WE DON'T NEED YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!\"\n...and heard, from that vortex of final color, a god giggle.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Dodging the gravity waves and other strange phenomenon caused by quantum fluctuations in 'normal' space-time, the fleet streaked towards its chosen targets at nearly fifty times the speed of light. The predators closed in.\nOrbiting the once-inhabited planet of Mamie, the VekTor fleet patiently waited. The rain of bombs had ceased, for there was no longer any life on the planet to destroy. No living beings were present in the entire solar system, in fact, for the VekTors employed unmanned bombing ships. Sentient beings often felt compassion. Sometimes they refused the orders to drop bombs on an inhabited planet. The tortured, smoking continents gazed accusingly up at the orbiting ships with cratered eyes. For the Green Hand population, the Bishop relief fleet would come much, much too late. The automated bombers completed another orbit. Their prey was dead, and so now the bombers awaited orders that would send them out to 'disinfect' another planet.\nBetween predator and predator, between ship-killers and planet-killers, lay light-years of empty space. Empty, cold, dark, lifeless... lifeless, that is, except for the small malicious spark of menace, the cold calculator of probabilities and paths, that lay waiting. A tiny fragment of machine intelligence, an A.I. floating in the void, the Renshai command sub-center woke from its long electronic slumber. Sensors had finally picked up the tell-tale traces of a fleet in jump-space. It was time for the minefield to perform its function. The prey was in the web, and now the spider had roused itself. It was killing time.\nOn the bridge of the B.R.N.* ship God's Warrior, Cardinal Grant sat, lost in the pure and holy sounds of Fenguati IV's native population performing ancient Gregorian chants rumored to have originated on Old Earth itself. He wiped a single tear from the corner of his eye before the rest of the bridge crew could notice, and sat up straighter in his chair. \"All right, end music. Second shift, you may enter the bridge.\" The second shift began to file reverently into the airy, cathedral-like bridge as Grant stood, ran his hand across the arm of his chair in a ritual gesture, and turned to leave.\nIn the emptiness, flares of light showed as single-use warp drives brought the spider's tools in for the kill. Dozens of bomb-pumped lasers** and Hawking Singularity Generators*** warped in, positioning themselves in the path of the oncoming fleet.\nThe nav and sensor operators were both out of their chairs with their replacements getting ready to sit down when the boards lit up. Grant froze two steps from his command chair as the second-shift sensor tech leaped to his place, fingers moving across the controls even before his feet had stopped moving. \"Sir! We've got multiple anomalous gravity wells at 8 light-minutes! Warp drop-out in nine seconds!\" A shout came from navigation, \"Minefield! We've got a minefield! Plotting avoidance course! SIR! We aren't going to make it!\"\nWith a flash of blinding light, God's Warrior slammed back into normal space, dragged out of jumpspace by the temporary black holes created by the Hawking Generators. Dozens of smaller frigates popped out on the battleship's tail, lighting the small objects waiting for them with a rapid-fire strobe effect. For a moment, stillness returned. The aiming thrusters on the mines spun them to orient on their assigned targets. The Renshai sub-processor gave the signal with electronic glee.\nReverend Tully of the Persephone held the arms of his command chair in a death-grip as his frigate made the transition from jumpspace to normal-space. \"Get close to the battleship!\" he screamed to his nav officer. \"They'll shield...\"\nThe first 1-megaton bomb-pumped laser detonated approximately 50 meters from Persephone's bow. The beam wasn't aimed at her. It didn't matter. On board St. Valentine, Reverend Valentine (the XIIth) calmly watched the transition on his viewscreen. \"God's Will\", he thought, just before the laser beam from the Persephone's killer pierced his ship lengthwise, converting the interior bulkheads to superheated plasma. The beam exited her stern, barely even dimmed by the energy expended in gutting the ship.\nTree of Life's commander, Willson, didn't even have time to register that transition was complete, as his ship dropped out of jumpspace just in time to meet the same laser beam that had killed St. Valentine. The frigate's weak armor had no more hope of stopping the beam than the first had. Tree of Life blew apart as the laser penetrated the warp drive mechanisms.\nGod Warrior spun end-for-end as she skimmed the gravity well of one of the tiny artificial singularities that had pulled the fleet out of jumpspace. The singularity was white-hot, radiating in the X-ray and ultraviolet spectrums as its tiny mass obeyed the laws of quantum physics. As the larger mass of the battleship slipped by, the singularity was accelerated back towards the frigates.\nSeconds later, it reached its critical 'minimum mass' and radiated the remainder of its mass in a violent burst. The other three detonated as well, too far away to do any more harm. They did not need to, however. The frigates were already all dead.\nThe Renshai's spider was efficient.\nGod Warrior shuddered under the impact of the front half of a frigate on her shields. The wreck slid off to the side, spinning, and continued to fragment and spew atmosphere into space.\n\"How bad are we hurt?\" Grant spoke with a grim resignation.\n\"Sir... nothing penetrated our shielding. But... sir... Sir, all the frigates are... gone.\"\nCardinal Grant froze, his hand on the arm of his command chair, still one step away from safety, one step away from the place where he had commanded a fleet of sixty-five ships only minutes before. \"Gone? All of them?\"\nThe sensor tech nodded, wordlessly, fighting back tears.\nThe spider laughed soundlessly.\nAnd went back to waiting.\n* Bishop Righteous Navy\n** A nuclear device inside a reflective ball attached to a lens arrangement, a bomb-pumped laser is a good one-shot weapon for space battles. While the actual detonation is ineffectual at anything greater than point-blank range (there is no atmosphere to transmit a shock wave, and the radiation and heat are too diffuse to bother most shielded spaceships), the lens mechanism holds together just long enough to transform a significant portion of the explosion's radiated energy into a very strong laser beam. The credit for this version of missile tech in space warfare goes to the Honor Harrington book series by David Webber. Very good books. Try 'em.\n*** Stephen Hawking provided the first strong theories postulating that \"black holes\" were not -quite - black, due to quantum-mechanical effects. Black holes radiate at a rate inverse to their current mass, ie. a very large (massive) black hole will radiate very little (less than the 3-Kelvin background radiation that permeates the known universe), while a very small black hole (such as those created by my imaginary Hawking Generators) will radiate at a very high rate, losing mass as they do so, until they are no longer stable and explode. Here I am taking liberties with this minimum mass, which should be roughly one and one-half times the mass of the Earth's Sun, but I am assuming that the high-tech equipment that the Renshai minefields employ can create smaller singularities than this by folding space around a mass with modified \"warp field\" generators, and can sustain these smaller black holes for just long enough to ensure \"snaring\" a fleet. The whole \"destruction sequence\" where the lasers wreak havok with the lightly-armored frigates takes approximately seven seconds, by the way, which is why the singularities last long enough to punctuate the end of the encounter and not the middle of it.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

As the Doctor and Ace leave Sickbay, the Master seizes his opportunity to place Dr Crusher under his control. And now, the continuation...\n[Beginning of Act III]\n(Another shot of the Enterprise flying through space. The scene changes to Ten Forward. Riker is sitting alone at a table, drinking a blue beverage. Someone suddenly stands in front of his table.)\nPerson: \"May I join you, Commander?\"\nRiker: \"Diplomat. Yes, you may.\"\n(\"Strame\" sits.)\nStrame: \"I must apologize once again for my telepathic prompting with your captain. It was purely unintentional.\"\nRiker: \"Throughout my years in Starfleet, I have seen many races with unique abilities.\"\nStrame: \"Then you believe me?\"\nRiker: \"I think it is possible, yes.\"\nStrame: \"But you do not trust me?\"\nRiker: \"At this point, I'm not willing to judge anyone.\"\nStrame: \"I see.\"\n(Troi enters through the doors to Ten Forward.)\nStrame <slightly raising his voice>: \"Counsellor.\"\n(Troi walks over to Strame and Riker's table.)\nTroi: \"It is good to see Commander Riker and you talking.\"\nStrame: \"Yes, it is. Would you care to join us? You don't mind, do you, Commander?\"\nRiker: \"Not at all.\" (He gets up and brings another chair.)\n(Troi sits down.)\nStrame: \"The Commander and I were just discussing trust. I have a suggestion that might help increase our trust of one another. You do trust Counsellor Troi, don't you, Commander?\"\nRiker: \"Yes.\"\nStrame: \"Then if she monitors our discussion, there should be no danger of hypnosis due to telepathic contact. Is that correct Counsellor?\"\nTroi: \"Yes, if there is any I could sense it. However, there is no need to do it if you feel it is too much of a danger, Will.\"\nRiker: \"No, I think Strame has a point. Very well, Strame.\" (He looks directly into Strame's eyes.)\nStrame: \"Good. My people are the kind to stand up to the challenges of life, as I can tell are you.\"\nRiker: \"I face the challenges that I come into contact with as best I can. Deanna?\"\nTroi: \"He is not using any telepathic abilities currently.\"\nStrame: \"I would not dream of doing such a thing. I only wish for peace for Taurus XIII, as I do with you. I find eye contact, such as this, increases the chances of success dramatically. Wouldn't you agree, Commander?\"\nRiker: \"The idea seems sound enough.\" (He appears to be a bit groggy.)\nStrame: \"Of course, if I were to use eye contact for hypnosis, that would be using it for control. Do you feel controlled?\"\nRiker: \"Y-yes.\" (His eyes seem distant.) \"I am at your disposal, diplomat.\"\nStrame: \"Good, now there are other places you need to be right now. I will contact you soon, in private, with specific orders.\" (Troi and Riker get up and Strame smiles.) \"Farewell, Commander, Counsellor, I enjoyed our talk.\" (Riker and Troi leave.)\n(Strame takes another sip of his drink. He is only to be slightly startled by a voice from behind.)\nVoice: \"You're new here.\"\n(Strame turns to see Guinan.)\nStrame: \"Yes, madam...?\"\nGuinan: \"I'm Guinan, the bartender here.\"\nStrame: \"Ah, it's a pleasure to meet you.\"\nGuinan: \"I noticed you were talking to Commander Riker and Counsellor Troi.\"\nStrame: \"Yes, I'm a diplomat. I must be familiar with the crew, if I am to work properly with them.\"\nGuinan: \"I'd imagine.\" (Strame starts to look concerned, for some reason.)\nStrame: \"I really must be going.\" (He abruptly stands and leaves.)\n(Guinan raises her hand to her chin.)\nGuinan: \"I wonder...\"\n(The scene changes to the bridge. The TARDIS is now gone.)\nData: \"I have discovered an anomaly in the readings from Cargo Bay 4.\"\nPicard: (He gets up from his chair and walks over to the Ops console to stand beside Data.) \"Where we stored the Doctor's police box?\"\nData: \"As well as the equipment Diplomat Strame wished brought aboard.\"\nPicard: \"He was insistent about bringing it aboard by shuttle, too. Could it be another time machine?\"\nData: \"That is unknown. At this point, the readings can not be determined to be separate. If it is another time machine, it is too close to the other to get a clear reading.\"\nPicard: \"Continue monitoring it.\"\nData: \"Aye, sir.\"\n(Worf's communicator chirps.)\nCrusher <voice>: \"Crusher to Worf.\"\n(Worf taps his communicator.)\nWorf: \"Worf here.\"\nCrusher: \"I've discovered some things about the Larians that you might be interested in seeing.\"\n(Picard, sitting in the captain's chair, taps his communicator.)\nPicard: \"Anything that I should be concerned about, Doctor?\"\nCrusher: \"No, not at present. However, I still would like Worf to go over these readings.\"\nPicard: \"Very well.\"\n(Worf heads for the turbolift. The scene changes to sickbay, as Worf enters.)\nCrusher: \"The information I think you'll find interesting is in here.\" (Crusher leads Worf into the back part of sickbay, into a laboratory. The door closes behind them. She pushes something on a terminal and words appear on the screen.)\n(Worf scans the information.)\nWorf: \"There is nothing unusual about these readings.\"\nCrusher: \"Yes there is, right here.\" (She points at something on the screen with her left hand and rests her right on Worf's shoulder. As she does so, a hiss can be heard.)\n(Worf's eyes widen and he instinctually turns, grabbing Crusher's right hand. A hypospray is forced to fall out of her hand.)\nWorf: \"Doctor, what...\" (He collapses.)\n(Crusher picks up the hypospray and puts it in her pocket. She then leaves the room, and walks up to one of the nurses.)\nCrusher: \"Lieutenant Worf will be busy for some time. He's not to be disturbed.\"\nNurse: \"Aye, Doctor.\"\n(The scene changes to a private quarters. The Doctor and Ace are there. The Doctor is fiddling with a panel beside the door, with much of it taken apart. Ace is sitting on the couch across the room.)\nDoctor: \"Imagine, locking us in and posting a guard. As if we were prisoners.\"\nAce: \"If you would've let me keep the Nitro-9, we wouldn't be stuck here now.\"\nDoctor: \"Nonsense. Do you realize the damage you could cause on a ship like this?\"\n(Ignoring the Doctor's question, Ace stands and walks to stand beside him.)\nAce: \"What do you think you can accomplish with the door anyway, Professor?\"\nDoctor: \"I'll have it open any moment now.\"\nAce: \"How can you be so sure?\"\nDoctor: \"My past.\"\nAce: \"What about your past?\"\nDoctor: \"My past which is in the future.\"\n(Ace shrugs and rolls her eyes. Suddenly the door open.)\nDoctor: \"There!\"\n(A security officer walks in, phaser drawn.)\nSecurity officer: \"I am sorry. Lieutenant Worf has ordered you to stay in these quarters.\"\nDoctor: \"So he did.\" (Walks up to the security officer.) \"I realize how this must seem, but it really isn't as it seems.\" (Ace, who has snuck around behind the security officer, hits him over the head with an panel the Doctor removed to access the door control. The security officer collapses.) \"Ace! I'm sure that was unnecessary.\"\nAce: (She shrugs.) \"You wanted us to get out of here, right?\"\nDoctor: (He sighs.) \"All right, then. First, we'd better find where the Master is.\"\n(The Doctor and Ace exit through the door. Once in the corridor, the Doctor presses a button on the control panel to the door, causing it to close. He and Ace walk on down the corridor. The scene changes to the bridge again. Crusher and Troi walk onto the bridge from the turbolift and stand before Picard.)\nPicard: \"Doctor, Counsellor.\"\nCrusher: \"We have to talk, Jean-Luc.\"\nPicard: \"Have you discovered anything about those readings?\"\nCrusher: \"Worf is still looking into that.\"\nTroi: \"I think we should talk in private, Captain.\"\nPicard: \"Very well.\" (He gets up, doing the \"Picard maneuver\" as he does so, and walks to his ready room. Crusher and Troi follow.)\nTroi: \"Doctor Crusher and I are concerned.\"\nPicard: \"About this time travelling Doctor or Diplomat Strame?\"\nCrusher: (She leans on his table slightly.) \"About neither, actually. We're concerned about you, Jean-Luc.\"\nPicard: (He raises an eyebrow.) \"Me?\"\nTroi: \"The Doctor and Strame both seem deceptive. And if they are of the same race and have the ability to control others, there is no reason to think you would be immune to both.\"\nPicard: \"You think I might be controlled. You would be able to sense that, would you not?\"\nTroi: (She starts walking around one side of Picard's desk.) \"Perhaps. In fact, there is a definite sense of inner conflict in you.\"\nPicard: (He stands.) \"Nonsense. I would know if I was being controlled.\"\nCrusher: (She walks around the other side of Picard's desk.) \"You would tell us the that even if you were being controlled.\" (She removes a hypospray from her pocket.) \"I must relieve you of command.\"\nPicard: (He reaches up and taps his communicator.) \"Picard to Worf.\" (There is no answer.)\n(Picard tries to reach for his communicator again, but Troi stops him. Before he can break her hold, Crusher pushes the hypospray into his shoulder. He collapses. She then steps back and crouches down by Picard's unconscious body, tapping her communicator as she does so.)\nCrusher: \"Crusher to Data.\"\nData <voice>: \"Yes, Doctor?\"\nCrusher: \"Counsellor Troi and I require your assistance.\"\nData <voice>: \"On my way.\" (The door opens within seconds. He immediately sees Picard.) \"The Captain?\"\nCrusher: \"Troi determined he was being controlled.\"\nData: \"By whom?\"\nTroi: \"I wasn't able to determine that.\"\nCrusher: \"Needless to say, I had to relieve him of command.\"\nData: \"That would be the standard process. He resisted?\"\nCrusher: \"Yes, I had to sedate him.\" (She raises the hypospray.) \"If you would take him to sickbay, I'll notify Commander Riker.\"\nData: (He goes over to Picard and easily lifts him.) \"I shall make sure the Captain will not harm anyone and that he, himself, will not come to harm.\" (He leaves.)\nCrusher: (She taps her communicator.) \"Crusher to Riker.\"\nRiker: \"Riker here.\"\nCrusher: \"The plan was successful.\"\n(The voice of the Master then comes through the communicator, from Riker's end.)\nMaster: \"Excellent.\"\n[End of Act III]","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Data, his hands at his side folded like fists, approaches and stands beside Geordi.)\nGeordi: \"Hi, Data. I'm glad to see you. I've been going over these Larian schematics backwards and forwards, and there seems to be some strange anomaly that I just can't put my finger on.\"\n(Data says nothing, but swiftly reaches up and pulls off Geordi's communicator. Holding the communicator in front of him, he closes his hand and a crunching sound can be heard.)\nGeordi: \"Data!\"\nData: \"I must apologize for the necessity of doing that as swiftly as possible. However,\" (He opens his other hand to reveal two new communicators.) \"with one of these you will be able to maintain contact with necessary personnel.\"\nGeordi: \"But, why, Data?\"\nData: \"One of our guests apparently has control over the minds of several Enterprise officers. These communicators will allow us to keep in contact without having to go through the main computer.\"\nGeordi: \"But to do that...\"\nData: \"I had to recalibrate them to send on one band, not commonly scanned by the Enterprise computers.\"\nGeordi: \"The other communicator?\"\nData: \"It is for Worf. I suspect you will find him in sickbay, where he was last seen. Ask for him there.\"\nGeordi: \"What makes you think I can be trusted?\"\nData: \"The affect of the mind control can be averted by those with strong wills or who would be otherwise unaffected by direct optical hypnosis. Your VISOR should provide you with sufficient protection.\"\nGeordi: \"Okay, I'll do it. Is Captain Picard affected?\"\nData: \"I cannot comment on that at the present time. If you, with Worf, could meet me in Cargo Bay 4 in thirty minutes, we will work out a plan to find and stop the responsible party.\"\nGeordi: \"I'll see you then.\"\n(Data and Geordi leave, going their separate ways. The scene changes to Data's quarters, where the lights are dim. A figure stands in the darkness as Data enters.)\nData: \"I have successfully completed phase 1 of the operation.\"\nPicard: (Coming out of shadow) \"Very good, Mister Data. Now, we had best make our way to Cargo Bay 4. We will, of course, have to be careful to avoid Security. They are most likely looking for us, since we never showed up at Sickbay.\"\nData: \"Aye, sir.\" (He starts for the door, then stops and turns.) \"Sir, should we not try to convince the crew that it is Commander Riker, Counsellor Troi, and Doctor Crusher who are being controlled?\"\nPicard: \"I doubt that your observation that Doctor Crusher and Counsellor Troi were acting unusually would be enough to sway the minds of the entire crew. Presently, there is no reason to polarize the crew's opinions of who is and is not being controlled. Also, we need to find who is controlling them. It might not be easy while they know they have the disadvantage.\"\nData: \"Very well, sir.\" (He and Picard leave.)\n(The scene changes to a corridor. The Doctor and Ace are walking along it.)\nAce: \"I tell you, Professor, we're lost.\"\nDoctor: \"Nonsense. These corridors all look alike. At any rate, we won't find the TARDIS or the Master if we stay in one place.\"\nAce: \"But we won't find them either if we're caught. We've already avoided a lot of security officers.\"\nDoctor: \"Then we'll just have to keep doing it, won't we?\"\n(Suddenly he stops, and holds up his hand to signal Ace to do the same.)\nDoctor <whispering>: \"Quickly, over here.\" (They step down a side corridor as a Security Guard passes.)\nAce: \"See? We can't do that forever.\"\n(Suddenly, a security guard comes around the corner from the other direction. At first he's surprised, but then he draws his phaser.)\nSecurity guard: \"Stop! You're coming with me to see Commander Riker.\"\n(The Doctor and Ace raise their arms and start walking ahead of the Security officer. The scene changes to sickbay, where Geordi enters. He approaches a nurse.)\nGeordi: \"I'm looking for Worf.\"\nNurse: \"Doctor Crusher said he isn't to be disturbed.\"\nGeordi: \"I'll take full responsibility.\"\nNurse: \"Doctor Crusher really should be notified.\"\nGeordi: \"Why? Worf isn't being treated for a medical problem, is he? How long has he been here?\"\nNurse: \"Since Doctor Crusher left a half-hour ago.\"\nGeordi: \"Look, this a Security matter and it's important I see him immediately.\"\nNurse: \"Okay, he's in the lab, back here.\" (The nurse leads Geordi to the lab door and presses the button. There is no response from the inside.)\nGeordi: \"Are you sure he's in there?\"\nNurse: \"Yes, this is the room.\"\n(Geordi presses another button on the side of the door and it opens. He and the nurse go inside. Geordi immediately sees Worf's body and runs over to it. He quickly feels for Worf's pulse.)\nGeordi: \"He's okay. Do you have anything that can wake him?\"\nNurse: \"Yes, but Doctor Crusher...\"\nGeordi: \"He needs to be treated right now. It's important.\"\nNurse: \"I don't know, but...\" (The nurse goes and brings back a hypospray.) \"this should wake him up.\"\n(The hypospray hisses against Worf's arm. His eyes suddenly pop open and he throws Geordi back into a table.)\nWorf: \"Commander! My apologies. I thought you were... someone else.\" (He helps Geordi up.)\nGeordi <winded>: \"That's okay, but next time be a little gentler.\"\nWorf: \"A warrior is not gentle.\"\nGeordi: \"Right now, we've got work to do.\" (He and Worf leave.)\n(The scene changes to the corridor outside of sickbay. Worf is affixing the new communicator to his uniform.)\nWorf: \"I must find Doctor Crusher.\"\nGeordi: \"I know how you feel, but Data wants us to meet him in Cargo Bay 4.\"\nWorf: \"Doctor Crusher is being controlled. She cannot be allowed to roam the ship unattended.\"\nGeordi: \"It looks to me like Data thinks it important that you're there. We don't really know who's being controlled other than Doctor Crusher right now.\"\n(The Doctor and Ace, followed by the Security guard, still with phaser drawn, come down the corridor.)\nSecurity guard: \"Lieutenant Worf, these two escaped and I was just taking them to Commander Riker for questioning.\"\nWorf: \"You will release the Doctor and his companion to my custody. I'll make sure they get to Commander Riker.\" (He draws his own phaser.)\nSecurity guard: \"Aye, sir.\" (He leaves.)\nDoctor: \"Thank you.\"\nWorf: \"There is no need to thank me. I'm going to do as I say. However, it may be useful if Commander Data questioned you first.\"\n(They walk on down the corridor. The scene changes to the bridge. Ro is at the conn. Riker sits in the command chair, with Troi in her usual spot at his left. Seated to his right, in Riker's usual seat, is Doctor Crusher.)\nRo: \"We're approaching Taurus XIII, sir.\"\nRiker: \"Take us out of warp and establish standard orbit around the planet, Ensign.\"\nRo: \"Aye, sir.\"\nCrusher: \"Soon Diplomat Strame will have the chance to see how well his strategy will work.\"\nRiker: \"Yes, he will.\"\nTactical officer: \"We are being hailed, sir.\"\nRiker: \"On screen.\"\n(The main view screen changes from the view of the greenish planet to a face of a Taurusian. He is basically a human with dark hair, except that two bones go from the top of his nose to the middle part of the top of his head. The resulting effect makes it look like the bone structures are large eyebrows.)\nTaurusian: \"I am Sl'itone of Taurus XIII. We welcome the United Federation of Planets starship Enterprise.\"\nRiker: \"I'm Commander William T. Riker commanding the Enterprise.\"\nSl'itone: \"Commander? I was under the impression that a certain Captain Picard was your leader.\"\nRiker: \"He is. However, recent events have forced me to take command.\"\nSl'itone: \"I am sorry to hear of your Captain's misfortune. Diplomat Strame is traveling on your ship, is he not?\"\nRiker: \"He will be down at the earliest possible opportunity.\"\nSl'itone: \"Very good. Until then, Commander.\" (Screen goes back to a view of the planet.)\n(The scene changes to Cargo Bay 4. Picard and Data walk through the door. Data is holding a tricorder. Both Picard and Data wear phasers, as well as another device on the other side of their uniforms.)\nData: \"The readings I discovered earlier are emanating from the Doctor's vehicle, sir. However, the other, overlapping, reading is also present.\" (He points at some barrels.) \"Behind those barrels.\"\nPicard: (Unholsters his phaser) \"Let's approach with caution, Data.\"\n(Data takes out his phaser, too, and holds it in one hand and the tricorder in the other. As they walk, he studies the readings.)\nData: \"Captain, a life sign has just appeared from out of, basically, thin air. There has been no transporter activity, however. The reading is of a...\"\nStrame: (He walks from behind the crates, holding a small object in his hands which is pointed directly at Picard and Data.) \"I believe the word you are looking for, Data, is 'Larian.' Or, more appropriately, 'Time Lord.'\"\nPicard: \"Time Lord? That means that the Doctor was telling the truth.\"\nMaster: \"An annoying habit he started long ago. Yes, I am the Master. Not that it will matter to you for much longer. Be quite assured, Commander, that this weapon, which compresses the tissue it comes into contact with, would be sufficient to stop you. I would hate to kill you before I was ready.\"\nPicard: \"We are part of this plan of yours?\"\nMaster: \"Yes, quite so. Walk with me.\" (He allows Picard and Data to get in front of him and follows them toward the other end of the cargo bay.) \"Your petty politics with the Taurusians and Romulans will soon be disrupted. A Federation starship captain taken hostage by the Romulans could cause much chaos. As would a Federation ship attacking a Romulan warbird in non-Federation space. The resulting war would provide many opportunities for an outsider to take control of one government or the other. Or, even both.\"\n(Suddenly the door opens behind the Master. Worf, Geordi, the Doctor, and Ace come through the doorway. The Master turns. Quickly he fires a shot at them. Seeing him, however, Geordi and the Doctor jump to one side and Worf and Ace to the other. Data quickly leaps forward, knocking the weapon from his hand. The Master quickly runs toward where his TARDIS is being stored. Worf, using a barrel for protection, fires a phaser blast at the Master, which misses.)\nDoctor: \"You're letting him get away.\" (He starts running around the corner, as does everyone else.) \"There! That's his TARDIS.\" (The Master's TARDIS looks like a big box, presumably what \"Strame\" had brought aboard. The door closes as the Master enters.)\nWorf: \"He will not have the opportunity to leave.\" (He fires a phaser blast at the TARDIS, which hits, but has no affect. The Master's TARDIS starts taking off and soon fades.)\nDoctor: (He points a finger at Picard.) \"You have unleashed a terror on this universe!\"\n[End of Act IV]","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Indeed, this was so for all of us, and we had no cause to doubt the veracity of this foresight or the ability of those who made these plans to carry them out, for were we not the children of the gods? And did the gods not walk among us, clothed in the flesh of men?\nEven in the creche, as I played with my brothers and sisters, as we unknowingly strengthened our fledgling minds and bodies, as sacred purpose forged us into unbreakable instruments, even then we knew the will of the gods. Each of us felt the touch of the gods as they gave to us our morality. You must understand that right for me had always been defined by a translucent inner glow of satisfaction, wrong by peaking fear, sweating, nausea, blood pounding on endlessly through my flesh. So it was for all of us. The gods knew our actions and reached into our hearts to deliver approbation or disapproval. So we knew them.\nAnd they favored us beyond ordinary mortals. Were we not the Chosen? They gave us the gift of security, for did they not provide our every need? They gave us the gift of their presence, for did they not walk among us as solicitous gods will? They gave us the gift of knowledge, for did they not teach us everything needed to perform the will of our gods? And they gave us the gift of control. We learned to control our physical responses, to use and tune our bodies like beautifullycrafted instruments by playing the strings of our internal levels of excitement. The gods trained each of us to use this control, elevating our responses in combat, heightening our reflexes, giving us the benefit of more than simple adrenalin. We could fully utilize in the service of the gods what ordinary men barely touch in moments of extreme fear and anger.\nI used this gift many times carrying out the will of the gods. At no time did I feel remorse. Why should I? The gods gave my subjects to me to offer up, told me to kill, and so it was right. Historically, other religions than ours have produced fanaticism on a larger scale with less certainty of the divine will.\nThat was why, in the fullness of my time as a servant of the gods, Inders called me into his office, his face white but his voice calm. I was the best, foremost among the Chosen. He was chief in our pantheon. I knew him as I knew all of the gods, by that inner wrench called awe. In heat and trembling, in that upheaval of fear did our gods make themselves known to us, and only in their presence did the straight line of my existence peak so, such that fear became ecstasy. \"Luke. I have a new assignment for you.\"\nI nodded, waiting as he ran his tongue over his lips. In another I might have judged this to be nervousness, but the gods are unreadable by definition. \"This is a special assignment, unlike any you have ever had. Paul has defected, betraying the WPF, fragmenting us into factions. There is no telling how far he might go. You must find him and kill him.\"\nHe gave me information about how to find Paul, and I noted it automatically, trying to hide my discomfort from my god. To kill a god! War between the gods! Such a concept attacked my stolid plane of security, ate into me like poison. Inders was the head of our pantheon, yes, but Paul was our master, our mentor, the smith that forged our souls in the heat of his discipline. Had he not been a god, I still would have worshiped him. And now Inders had commanded that I kill him. I could do nothing to Paul, yet I could not disobey the will of the gods. Frozen, I studied the situation until the roiling within me slowly died. I was being tested, for Paul would surely destroy me in my insolence as I attacked him, a god. I would not fail the test, pleased to offer myself up for the gods at any time. I nodded to myself as I resolved the difficulty. I looked up at Inders.\n\"Has he any of the Chosen with him?\"\nInders seemed to shudder, but his voice sounded steady. \"None.\"\nI bowed out of the room and left. Finding Paul was easy enough, for he had left me a clear trail. He had isolated himself with two men at one of our dispersion points, a bar in the city. The bar betrayed no sign of customers, so he would be alone but for his escort, and his close presence implied a readiness to receive a message, such as I represented. I did not carry a weapon, but prepared to follow the orders to the letter. I was to seek Paul's destruction, and in it my own. It did not take me long to go up to the high place, where he waited for me.\nPaul marked his presence with the bodies of men. So did he show me favor. Big men, they stood loosely, their casual pose belying the alertness which shimmered through them. They were professionals, but they were not of the Chosen. I saw them as an offering to Inders, a way to declare the purity of my intention to Paul.\nI walked toward them casually, betraying no flush, no rise of energy, in fact feeling a slight warm lassitude as I strolled closer. The nearest one saw me but controlled himself, clamping down on the nervousness and tension which fatigued his body even at rest. For those not of the Chosen, such constant alertness has its price. They took such pride in their control. But this man was cautious. He wanted to identify me before he risked openly gunning me down.\nI was too close when I saw his eyes widen, saw him begin to turn, watched his hand begin its smooth descent, and then the flush of adrenalin came upon me and the blood-red haze descended. I closed the distance, one hand pinning his as he tried to pull the pistol from the holster, the other striking deep into the soft tissues of his throat, so that the force of the blow crushed his larynx and smashed the back of his head into the corner of the wall behind with a clear crunch of breaking bone.\nHis partner pulled his weapon clear, but I had already twisted my first victim's pistol free. I fired through the coat, the pistol chuffing softly twice as the suppressor ports flared. He moved slowly, his responses glacial as I came up to speed. The impact of the heavy ten millimeter caseless rounds sounded louder than the report of the pistol, the smoldering coat gave off a harsher, more noticeable odor than the propellant.\nThe light in his eyes still burned as he fell back, dropping his unfired weapon. The back of my second offering's head cratered into non-existence by the expansion of the mercury-loaded shells, he hit the ground heavily a tenth of a second after his partner, and a twentieth of a second before I entered the door they guarded.\nI moved swiftly, the fever burning in me now, giving me plenty of energy and more than enough speed. To my surprise I met no resistance, only the sight of a solitary figure seated at a low, chemise-covered table. My senses peaked before I allowed the power to flow back, certain that no one waited in concealment nearby. I had known, somehow, that he would test me himself.\nI approached him slowly, my breathing fading to normality, my pulse less insistently present, my temperature dropping more quickly than possible for one not of the Chosen. He twirled a glass absently in one hand, and did not look up until I slid into the seat he had courteously placed across from him. When he glanced up and smiled, I lost some of my fear, reassured by his pleasant, open face and the dignified streaking of gray at his temples. Then I met his blue eyes and regained my fear. \"Hello Paul.\"\nHis smile was genuinely warm. \"Hello Luke.\" His eyes dropped, and he seemed to notice the pistol for the first time.\nHis smile faded as I placed the pistol flat on the table, but kept one hand on it lightly. \"Do you know why I am here?\"\nHe nodded, his smile now gone. \"Inders sent you.\"\nMy face was serious, but I kept my voice steady. \"I hope you will have mercy on me, Paul.\"\nHe laughed unsteadily. \"Mercy isn't mine to give.\" He paused, then looked at me strangely. \"Do you know why I'm here, Luke?\"\nI swallowed, but could not reply, my belly roiling within me. He continued before I found my voice. \"I could have run farther. I could have taken more precautions, taken more men. I could have made it expensive for you to find me. But I know you, all of you, better than anyone, better even than Inders.\"\nHe paused, suddenly looking gray and haggard, all too mortal. I was too much a fool to see it then. \"It was their project, not mine. They twisted your minds and bodies, made you what you are. I couldn't take that any more, seeing what you children had become. I picked you out, held you in my own hands, trained you, watched the changes take effect, and watched you use the gifts we gave you even as they corrupted you.\"\nHe broke off, ran his hands through disordered hair as I blinked, not knowing how to respond to a god who was ceasing to be godlike. Still he kept his hold on me, kept the thrill of awe running through me, for so do I know my gods. He spoke again, his eyes suddenly alive. \"But I know enough, knew more than they did. You were still human, still men in spite of Inders' biological manipulation. And it is the way of a man to turn his face from his gods and cast them down when they fail him. Men always destroy their gods in the end. It would have happened eventually, but I can precipitate it. You will be the instrument. Do you know your namesake, star of the morning? Tell me, are you familiar with hubris?\"\nI was caught off guard, lured into his words as his body twisted. Then training, his training, took over and I lunged, fever rising in me into a blur of speed. The softness of the double report surprised me as I staggered to my feet, blood hot on my left hand, the arm numbed from the impact of the bullet. I stared at Paul, folded upon himself grotesquely in death, his face surprisingly peaceful as it turned up toward the sky. A god had died and left the corpse of a man behind.\nIt took me time to bind my arm, more time to leave that place. It had taken but an instant to reorder my world. I tucked the pistol into the back of my belt as I stepped out the door. I turned my face away from my fallen god and too quickly came to the other.\nInders looked shocked when he saw me, fatigued and bloody, leaning against his door. \"Did you?...\"\nI nodded, tired and sore suddenly, smiling at the silent presence of Micah, one of my brothers. Somehow the world had changed for me. I had lost something which had kept it safe and comfortable. It had not been so brilliant before, so large and terrifying, looming above me in magnificent splendor.\nPerhaps my new perspective had given me cynicism, or perhaps they had trained me too well. Whatever the cause, I saw Inders turn and nod to Micah, and I saw Micah begin to move leisurely, for he expected no resistance. He would have expected it in another, perhaps, but not in one of the Chosen. Not in the presence of a god.\nI had not been searched. As one of the Chosen I was above reproach. Perhaps even before then I had already contemplated the unthinkable. Why else would I have carried the pistol into that place? I slipped my hand from my side into the back of my belt even as Micah began to draw. I beat him narrowly: my slug smashing the bones of his hand to powder, his only creasing my side, causing pain to blaze whitely under the surge of adrenalin.\nMicah stooped and rolled, his other hand closing around the pistol he had dropped, but I had already turned, bringing my weapon into line with the man who rose from behind the desk, shaking, his face white with sudden realization. I shot him in the left eye and whipped back to Micah, whose left hand held the pistol solidly on the center of my body, but whose sole awareness focused on the enormity of Inders' death. More than a god, an entire religion died with one large, slightly overweight, gray-haired man, and it was the passing of this, not the shell, that held me as frozen as Micah against the support of the door.\nMicah pulled his attention back to me, his hand trembling. \"You killed him.\"\nI sighed, increasing the blocks on the pain which throbbed in my arm and surged afresh in my side. Blood would mark me. I would have to conceal its traces when I made my escape. Paul's training still held, long after the fact of his death.\nI answered Micah frankly as I pulled myself upright, away from the support of the door.\n\"Inders is dead. Paul is dead. There are no gods for us anymore.\"\nMicah stared at me stupidly as his body stilled, the distanced flatness of his voice revealing his distress, such that he had consciously dampened the responses of his body. \"What are you, that you could kill a god?\"\nI pointed at the body. \"Was he a god, who died so easily?\"\nI turned on my heel and left. He did not kill me. I have been running since, hunted by the men who supported my existence for so long, some of whom once walked among us as gods. And they are all men. Not one of them has been one of my brothers or sisters. I have heard rumors, and I fear that the Chosen are all dead. But then everyone dies. Even gods.\nI think often of Paul as I run. I remember his question and I wonder which of us he meant when he spoke of the pride which sins against the gods. But the gods don't seem to matter as they once did. My existence is not as orderly, or even as pleasant as it was when the gods ruled me.\nNow I no longer follow the way of a child, and the path I tread shifts under my feet as it leads me into an uncertain future. And while the absence of all constraints which surrounds me now is sometimes frightening, in it I find something of myself that I never knew before. Even hunted and fugitive, I have more than I had when I served the gods. I will never give them anything of myself again, for though I fear and am not comforted, though I tremble and am not stilled, though I move and am not guided, I am my own.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

If he had a martini, Dennis knew, he would inevitably have a second to pass the time, since Frances was invariably half an hour late for any social engagement. He knew that she could be on time when she had to be, because she ran her own public-relations firm and never kept a client waiting. When he pointed this little inconsistency out to her, she merely shrugged: one thing had nothing to do with the other. If she was late for their dinners, and it was never more than five minutes, she hastened to remind him, it was only because she had become so immersed in this or that that she lost track of the time. Dennis knew better than to ask why she didn't lose track of the time when she was meeting a client. One thing had nothing to do with the other.\nOnce he had deliberately arrived half an hour late himself. On the way he had fantasized about coming into Taormina and finding Frances impatiently drumming her fingers as she waited for him to show up. But with the uncanny prescience of the chronically late, Frances had arrived half an hour after he had, so nothing had been accomplished. Sometimes Dennis wondered if Maureen, their waitress, didn't phone Frances the minute he walked in, to give her a thirty-minute warning. If he actually had two martinis this evening, he might just ask her.\nOn the other hand, Taormina was not the kind of restaurant where you dawdled over a cup of coffee. Besides, even in his new powder-blue cotton suit, Dennis was still too hot to drink any liquid warmer than liquid nitrogen. (That was the kind of joke he could never tell Frances, because, not being a scientist herself, she would not have understood its significance.)\nNot that anyone would have noticed if he had drunk liquid nitrogen, since Taormina was so dimly suffused with red light that you couldn't even have read a menu - had there been a menu to read, that is. That's why Maureen always recited the bill of fare, with interpretive gestures and eye rolls, like a kindergartner making the most of her long-awaited turn at show and tell.\nTaormina was so dark tonight - or was it that he had just come in from the glare of an August afternoon? - that at first he could barely see the only other two people in the room. (As a matter of fact, he had neither seen nor heard them when he had come in.) They might have been he and Frances from a previous visit. Taormina was so small that they had probably sat at every one of its round, white-clothed tables more than once.\nThe couple was in the far corner and the man was sitting with his back to the wall, which is exactly the position Dennis would have chosen, since it would have allowed him to survey the entire room. He also disliked the idea of anyone, even someone as jolly and chubby as Maureen, creeping up behind him, which is why he was now seated on a banquette.\nFrom what he could see of him, the man was a good ten years older than Dennis, around forty-five. He had the kind of distinguished-looking hair that Dennis, being a sandy blonde, could never have: grey with an underlayer of black. Even his mustache had the same layered look. (When Dennis had grown a mustache at Penn, it had come in so light that it looked as if he had bleached it, so he shaved it off.) It was hard to tell how tall he was, because he was sitting down, but Dennis guessed that he was several inches taller than Dennis's own 5'8\". He was wearing a grey herringbone-tweed suit. The thought of wearing such a suit himself made Dennis's skin crawl, since he couldn't abide anything rough against his body, especially on a day as hot as today was. This was why he preferred summer suits even in the dead of winter; he'd much rather be cold than crawly.\nThe woman had her back to Dennis. Perhaps it was just a trick of the dim red lighting, but she looked very much like Frances: slender, animated, about twenty-eight, with long, straight blonde hair. The hand momentarily resting on the arm of the mahogany captain's chair even wore the same kind of little black glove that Frances did when she was entertaining a client. Draped over the back of her chair - he could hardly believe it - was a fur coat. On a day like this.\nHer face was turned away from him, but he could tell from the tone of the voice that just barely reached him that she was trying to make a very important point.\nDennis strained to hear what she was saying.\nWith a guilty start, he realized that Maureen was standing at his elbow, looking as incongruous in her frilly, virginal white uniform as a male construction worker in a tutu. She was the kind of person with whom you became intimate friends while she was taking your first order. In her late thirties and divorced, she was exuberantly, unabashedly promiscuous and never failed to give Dennis and Frances a play-by-play rundown of her latest amour. \"This is it,\" she would begin each recital, \"this is really it.\" When Dennis pointed out to her that that's what she had said the last time and the time before that, Maureen would counter, \"This time I really mean it.\" When she was between engagements, so to speak, she lived in continuous expectation of running into Mr Right around every corner. This was why she put on a full face of makeup even to go to the laundromat. \"You never can tell,\" she explained. Dennis would like to have quoted Miss Moffat, from The Corn Is Green, to the effect that if Mr Right hadn't shown up by now, he had probably lost his way and wasn't coming.\nThese amorous blow-by-blow accounts of Maureen's never-ending work in progress always concluded with Dennis playfully accusing her of being a slut or a trollop. The old-fashioned sound of these Victorian epithets delighted the waitress so much that she burst into appreciative guffaws.\n\"The usual, Mr D.?\"\nHe nodded absent-mindedly, all thoughts of a chaste coffee evaporating like cheap after-shave lotion.\nAfter Maureen had gone, he realized that she hadn't regaled him with her latest amorous escapade. Even her voice had seemed subdued, as though something were on her mind. She had also called him Mr D., instead of Dennis. Perhaps the couple had been giving her a hard time.\nWhen his martini arrived, he took the first sip cautiously. It always tasted like shellac or perfume, he could never decide which, but once his tongue went numb it was heavenly. And, as Noel Coward pointed out in \"Uncle Harry,\" the after-effects were divine.\nHe glanced at his watch. It was incredible. Whenever he was waiting for Frances at Taormina, it was always 5:20. After he finished this martini and ordered another (this was now a foregone conclusion), he would look at his watch again - and it would still be 5:20. It was just like being on the beach at Atlantic City, only cooler.\nThe sound of throaty laughter made him turn toward the door, expecting to see Frances greeting Maureen, but there was no one there. The woman at the corner table had a laugh uncannily like Frances's.\nDennis looked at his watch. It was 5:21.\nThe woman was still laughing, her head thrown back so that her arched throat caught the dim red light. Her laugh made Dennis think of a quietly purring Rolls Royce.\nHer companion was obviously not appreciating her hilarity.\nDennis decided to give them names. Because the woman, svelte and soignee as a Vogue model, looked so much like his wife, he christened her Frances. The man, a bluff and blustery roast-beef-and-potatoes type, possibly a Brit, he labeled Algernon, after Jack Worthing's friend in The Importance of Being Earnest.\nHe checked his watch. It was 5:23.\nHe drained his glass and, using his elbow as a fulcrum, held it in the air for Maureen's retrieval. She replaced it with one she had been holding in readiness with the split-second timing of an acrobat flying through the air from one trapeze to the one swinging toward him.\nIt was still 5:23.\n\"I must say, I don't consider that very amusing, my dear,\" Algernon said loud enough for Dennis to hear. He sounded stuffy. And veddy, veddy British indeed.\n\"Don't you? Don't you, just?\" Frances answered acidly. \"Perhaps when Denny arrives, he'll be able to see the humor in it.\"\nDennis was startled. So this Frances had a Dennis too.\n\"Perhaps he's already arrived,\" Algernon commented, inclining his head toward Dennis himself.\nDennis suddenly felt self-conscious and exposed, his anonymity gone, like a member of a theater audience who an actor has suddenly chosen to stare at from the stage. Blushing, he looked down at his watch. It was still 5:23.\nHe glanced up to find that the woman had turned around in her chair and was staring at him too.\nIt was Frances.\n\"Denny, I can't believe you've been sitting there all this time by yourself. What on earth for? Do come and join us.\"\nNow Dennis felt as though the actor who had been staring at him had spoken directly to him and invited him to come up on the stage and join the play. Without thinking, he looked around to see if Frances could be talking to someone else.\n\"Algie's been most dreadfully anxious to meet you.\"\nAlgie?\n\"Well, my dear, I shouldn't have put it quite as vividly as all that.\"\nAlgie's accent was beginning to sound a trifle thick to Dennis, and a trifle phony. He was no more British than Dennis himself was.\nDennis stood up and started toward them when he was suddenly slapped in the face by what seemed like a wall of water. Slogging his way through it (he found himself thinking incongruously that the Red Sea had failed to part) was as arduous as walking across the bottom of the ocean and it was a relief to finally reach their table and slump down in the captain's chair between them. Touching his jacket, he expected to find it dripping wet, but it was as dry and unrumpled as it had been when he stood up, although surprising rough, like a pineapple.\nNeither Frances nor Algernon seemed to have noticed his difficulty.\n\"Why on earth didn't you join us the minute you got here? Really, Denny, by forty-five you should have gotten over this morbid shyness of yours.\"\nForty-five? What was she talking about? He touched his cheek as though that would somehow disprove her words. And why was she calling him Denny?\n\"Algie, I want you to meet my favorite banker, Dennis Dziewit.\" Unlike most people, Frances pronounced his Polish name properly - DeWitt - but he was used to variations that ranged from Dennis D. to Dennis Dwizeewhizeewhizee.\nHe was about to object that he was not a banker, nor forty-five, and not called Denny by anyone, especially his wife, as Frances herself very well knew, when she said, \"Denny, this is my husband, Algernon Moncrieff.\"\nAlgernon Moncrieff was the name of Jack Worthing's friend in Wilde's play.\n\"Frances, what the hell is - \" he started to say, but she interrupted him once more.\n\"Denny darling, there's no need to be so formal all of a sudden. I'm still Franny and I'm sure Algernon will want you to call him Algie.\"\n\"I'm sure,\" Algie agreed dryly.\nMaureen was reaching across him to pick up his drink.\n\"Oh, Mr D., why didn't you tell me? I don't know where my mind is today. Just wait a sec and I'll bring you the most imperfect manhattan you ever had.\"\nNow Franny was leaning in front of him to talk to Algernon, already smiling in anticipation of what she was about to tell him.\n\"When we were here last, old stick in the mud ordered his usual, and when Gwendolyn asked if he wanted a perfect manhattan, Denny said, no, that he wanted one as imperfect as he was.\"\nAs Algernon nodded his muted appreciation, Franny looked lovingly at Denny, like a doting mother watching her only child play a cucumber in the school pageant.\nSuddenly Franny leaped to her feet.\n\"Algie, we must run. Denny, if only you weren't always so late, we'd've had more time to chat.\"\nAs he stood up, she presented her cheek to him, but before he could kiss it, she was pulling her fur coat over her shoulders and bundling up inside it.\n\"Brrrr-undi,\" she shivered. \"I'm certainly not looking forward to going out in that blizzard again.\"\nAlgie, at the door, was heaving himself into a solid-black overcoat. He was already wearing a black astrakhan hat. As he ceremoniously opened the door for Franny, the wind blew in a gust of snow from the pitch-dark street. The cold cut through Denny like the blade of an ice skate, even though, as he now discovered, he was wearing a herringbone-tweed suit.\nWhen he sat down at the now-empty table, he was shivering.\nGwendolyn was just bringing in his drink - \"a bloody mary, with horseradish instead of Tabasco, just the way you like it, Mr Worthing.\"\nWhen he went to look at his watch, he found he wasn't wearing one.\nIt didn't matter. He knew it was still 5:23.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

This shouldn't have surprised him since he had gone to sleep in a make-shift prison. But it did. Twelve hours wasn't long enough to become acclimatised to such a drastic change in circumstances.\nNot that it was unknown for drug duty collectors to be less than welcome on any planet. Brid was used to treatment that ranged from wary to rude, but never so overtly hostile.\nHe wasn't alone. He saw on his fellow prisoners the same brooding expression that they wore last night, that he wore now. Unlike Brid, who had been travelling alone (who would willingly accompany a DDC?), the other prisoners were all from the same ship, an unnamed and unlicensed miner\/freighter. They were hauling a crude shipment of that super fertilizer, s-oil (pseudo-oil). A laconic bunch, they treated Brid with the same affection they showed each other. They ignored him.\nThe cavernous room was high-ceilinged with skylights palely illuminating a barren space, devoid of whatever alien furniture it had once held. From pockets of crisscrossing shadows came an occasional whimper or moan. With a gray crust pocking the walls and a fetid odor seeping from the pitted fibresand floor, the place was a microcosm of the ruined planet outside.\nHe had been sent to this weary planet only once before. With all the drugs consumed here, the duty collected was enormous, though he knew he was being cheated out of half of it. These aliens had all but destroyed their planet and now seemingly made a full time job of numbing themselves to their past sins.\nYet, it had its pleasure spots amongst the pain: spots of neon color amongst the pollution: resorts where one resorted to more profligate drug use. It was on one of these islands that Brid and the others found themselves imprisoned.\nHe self-diagnosed his depression as greater than even these dismal quarters warranted. He suspected that he, and the others, were being surreptitiously drugged. A prison within a prison. He made a supreme effort to shrug off this depression and approached his nearest neighbor.\nHe was about Brid's size, broad and fit. Brid recognized his rank as mid-level, probably navigation support. He had to physically nudge him to get a response.\n\"Hi, my name's Brid.\"\nThe dazed look that introduction achieved encouraged Brid to continue. \"They brought me here last night.\"\nWhen his companion actually nodded, Brid decided an outright question might be tolerated.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"Taorma.\" Simple question, simple answer.\n\"How long have you been here?\"\nTaorma merely shook his head. Brid mentally translated that as \"too long.\"\n\"What are they going to do with us?\"\nTaorma's stricken look alarmed him. Brid tried, however, to make light of it. \"That bad, eh?\"\nAfter a few moment's silence, Brid nudged Taorma again. \"No, really, I want to know.\"\n\"They fight us.\" Taorma looked Brid in the eye for the first time. \"Against each other.\" He looked down at the floor. \"To the death.\"\nDuring the next hour Brid learned what he could from Taorma's brief responses. He, and his remaining fifteen crew members and one passenger, were seized ten days ago. It was easy to keep track of time. A person a day. Ten days, ten dead. Taorma himself had just killed one of the crew yesterday, ripping his throat out, and dragging the poor soul around by his eye sockets, like a festooned bowling ball.\n\"They drug us with 'gressors after we're thrown into this glassed-in arena. They wager and laugh as the drug takes hold and we go at each other, with our bare hands and teeth. And, you know, for that fifteen minutes or so, it feels good. You're strong - god! you're strong, and full of purpose, and you feel no pain. Till later, later...\"\nTaorma had started crying then. \"Then you're so sick, in body and mind. The images... they won't stop. What you did....\"\nBrid perfunctorily tried to soothe Taorma, but his own mind was recoiling from the reductive fate he saw in front of him. To be torn apart, or to tear apart. That was the question.\nAnd true to form, late that afternoon, two of their number were dragged off. In his stuporous state, Brid just barely realized that one of them was a woman. Then, in the last instant before she disappeared, he thought he recognized her. Loelle!\nWith that last glimpse burning in his retina, he again approached Taorma. What would Loelle be doing on a freighter?\nTaorma showed a bare hint of curiosity at Brid's sudden enthusiasm. \"Yeah, that's Loelle,\" he told Brid. \"She's our one passenger, a disgraced ambassador, or something.\"\n\"But she's no warrior!\"\nA spark of anger from Taorma. \"None of us here are gladiators, buddy.\"\nBut he soon calmed down, seeing Brid's distress. \"Where do you know her from?\"\n\"From seven years ago.\" From another Brid ago.\nThose were the days when Brid had thought he was on the verge of a significant public service career. He had been figuratively second string for years now, finally poised for the nod to move up to first string. Instead, now he was clutching onto third string, barely a player at all.\nAt that time, Loelle was married to an entrepreneur with governmental connections, including a very profitable one to the official for whom Brid was an aide. Brid had been filling in for this official at a function when the three of them, the soon-to-be triangle, met.\nLoelle, of course, was beautiful, and her husband, of course, was obnoxious. The one part of that evening that Brid remembered, that Loelle mentioned one week later, in bed, that had made her first take notice of him, was a simple exchange.\nHer husband had been bragging on his business acumen; i.e., ruthlessness. He had summed up, \"There's a sucker born every minute.\"\nBefore he could self-edit, Brid calmly had asked him, \"Oh, and how often is an asshole born?\"\nLoelle had laughed and her husband had remembered. And Brid's next posting had suffered.\nBut it was almost worth it, Brid thought, as those months reeled through his brain. By the end, they had fallen in love. But when she was severed from her husband's fortune and he from any real career, they had each chosen their drug of choice for refuge, rather than each other. They parted in small gradations that passed without notice, until what they didn't notice didn't make any difference.\nBut they had had their golden moments. Here, in this prison, facing certain indignities before certain death, Brid actually chuckled, recalling one of their more outrageous scenes. Yes, they were outrageous together.\nHer husband was out of town, calling up nightly for a little phone-sex. What he thought was simultaneous masturbation was a lot more than that. Loelle's moans were real - and for Brid. When she saucily said she felt him inside her, she was really looking at and feeling Brid. And when she laughed...\nWell, that was then, and now - now was some macabre cosmic over-kill payback.\nThere was a commotion as a demented being was thrown in with them: Loelle. A victorious and vicious Loelle.\nEveryone kept their distance for the time it took for the last of the drug's residue to wear off. Brid cautiously approached her.\nShe didn't recognize him. She wouldn't have recognized herself in a mirror. She lay there in a bloody lump.\nAfter ascertaining that most of the blood was not hers, Brid gathered her into his arms and rocked the both of them to sleep.\nThe next morning she was voracious and ate with relish the lumpy slop they were offered. She was somewhat wired yet from the 'gressors, and didn't need to be prodded for information.\nBrid felt himself in the classic good news\/bad news situation. The good news is you're reunited with the one truly exciting woman of your miserable life; the bad news is you're both in a virtual slaughterhouse. He soon learned there was also worse news.\nShe kissed him after breakfast, apparently as pleased to be with him as he was with her. But the information she had to impart was dreadful.\n\"They don't care, they have no secrets. They know we're not going anywhere, and our life-expectancy is rather limited. In fact, they enjoyed taunting us with their 'grand plan.'\"\nThat sounded ominous enough to Brid. It was worse than he thought.\n\"This 'baiting and fighting' is just a entertaining way to dispose of us. Unlicensed freighters, tax collectors - and unseated ambassadors - have always had a way of disappearing. Nobody's going to be much vexed. At least not until it's too late.\" She shrugged, before continuing.\n\"What they really wanted, and now have, is our bodies to examine - and catalog.\"\n\"Catalog?\"\n\"Yeah, our genes.\" She gestured expansively. \"All our genes. Our genome. What makes us, us.\"\n\"What the hell for?\"\n\"To sell.\" She pursed her lips as she considered the irony. \"To sell back to us.\"\nBrid looked blank. Distressed, but blank.\n\"They're going to cause a disaster back at our home planet.\" Loelle explained. \"Destroy our ability to reproduce a reasonable semblance of ourselves. Damage our genome.\"\nShe shook her head. \"Oh, I don't know the science, but they'll do it in some innocuous way, some hyped-up high-energy particle emitters introduced in a meteorite shower. Something Amalgamated Planets can ignore. A way to conquer without appearing to.\"\nStunned, Brid managed to croak, \"Conquer?\"\n\"When they sell our genome back to us, 'saving' us, what they want in exchange is the ultimate in currency: the unspoiled portions of our planet. For vacation resorts,\" she snorted, before continuing.\n\"And they're not even stopping there. The genome we'll purchase, to avoid extinction, will have been subtly engineered. We'll be rendered more susceptible to manipulation. Spineless, if you will. Genetic subjugation. Eventually, they'll possess any part of our planet, any part of us, that they want. And no one will raise an alarm. You see, they'll have saved us from some terrible natural disaster.\"\n\"And I thought your husband was ruthless!\"\n\"He was.\" She smiled ruefully. \"Just not this clever. Not on this scale.\"\nBrid's mind was scrambling for some hope. Not for them, but for their species, for their planet. He thought out loud. \"But Amalgamated Planets. The Judgury can't be so easily fooled. Someone will raise suspicion.\"\n\"They control the Judgury, from behind the scenes. No one will buck them, not on something as contrived or convoluted as this. They're master manipulators, expert at sprinkling in just enough truth to avoid an outright challenge. Their pride lies not in honor but in cunning.\"\nShe took a deep breath. \"Just like the stratagems required of a hunter led to predators achieving a higher intelligence than herbivores, these aliens' habits of deception and cannibalism fueled the evolution of a superb mental agility. As their intrigues evolved, so did they. It's worth noting that a successful predator, much less a cannibal, cannot afford too enlightened a conscience.\"\n\"Cannibalism?\" Brid muttered. If they treat themselves so poorly, what hope have we?\nThinking back on their nondescript breakfast, Brid dourly finished for her. \"...each other.\"\nDuring the following days, their number slowly dwindled. Brid had now survived his own grisly joust. Though he and Loelle desperately sought out each other's solace, neither could summon any physical desire in such ghastly conditions. They slept huddled together and spent the days pacing and talking.\nSeven years ago, languishing away a hot afternoon drinking mixed elixirs in the shade of her husband's jungle garden, couched in comforts neither had paid for, Brid had teased Loelle: \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\"Young,\" she had answered, with a wry smile.\nWell, ambassador was what she got, at least for a while. He never did ask about that 'disgraced' part. He knew it was either that she was caught doing the right thing at the wrong time, or the wrong thing with the right person.\nAnd she didn't inquire about the high and noble times of a drug duty collector. What they did do is live together for the first time.\nAfter a meal, Loelle was always more talkative. But the conversation was never light. Now, she tilted her head thoughtfully as she spoke softly to Brid.\n\"As you know, my husband and I loved to use various alien idioms and aphorisms. Like 'Where there's a moon, there's a planet,' and 'On a waterless world, there is no desert.' One of my favorites was: 'You can't always ride what you can saddle.'\" She sighed. \"Well, I think we, as a species, are about to be saddled. I sure hope we can buck.\"\nBrid was silent for a minute, then wistfully quoted: \"'A forest can grow many creatures, but no creature can grow a forest.' That's the only one I know. I always liked the perspective it offered. I used to think it was an assertion of majesty. Now, it just seems a statement of resignation.\"\nHe shook his head. \"...I don't know, maybe that's just the 'pressors talking...\"\nShe nodded sardonically. \"Better that than the 'gressors acting...\"\nAlthough to plan for escape was ludicrous, not to do so was unthinkable. They couldn't so totally give up and yet continue to face each other, care for each other.\nThe obstacles to a successful escape attempt remained insurmountable. It wasn't merely the locks, the walls and the guards. No, it was mostly their anatomy that held them captive. It would be like an ape trying to pass amongst men without arousing notice. And any vehicle they might commandeer would be inoperable due to their structural differences. Their own ships were not on this grim island, nor were any stressed-space communication facilities.\nSo, their half-hearted planning was merely a charade to ward off the numbness that was their constant suitor. They tried to keep a glimmer of hope alive in their eyes, to show each other.\nIt was a week later. No one spoke. No one moved. They were all alone.\nBrid just sat there, dazed, staring at the wall. Envying it. He had had enough. Of life eating, cheating, beating life. He felt and didn't want to.\nLife-locked. His genes within his cells, his cells within his body, his body within this cell. His being within life.\nCould he be without life? Without this predation, this pain, this this...\n...This memory. Two hours ago, pumped with 'gressors, he had been thrown into a bout.\nHe had savagely mutilated his opponent. His own fur torn and shredded, he had grinned triumphantly at the human crowd's jeers and taunts. He had held high, like an offering, the blue head of Loelle.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The lanky, sandy haired administrator stepped down from the podium to the park recreation area of the marine colony, and shook hands with his supporters. If elected next year in 2010, he would be the first Council member chosen from a federal ocean base constituency. The Energy Consortium vowed that its candidate would defeat Tom, who fought for the development of cheap electric power.\n\"What did you think of my new grant proposal?\" asked a petite brunette. The smile left Cindy Chudy's face as Tom admitted, \"I forgot to read it.\"\n\"If I knew you were leaving, I would have signed up at a different location, with other experts in my research area of employee compensation.\" She turned away in anger.\nThe Council needed a Senator, who appreciated the need for funding Ocean bases. Few engineers wanted to emerge from a six year term to discover their knowledge was obsolete and they required extensive retraining.\nIn the middle of the fund raising picnic, alarm bells rang, heralding major seismic activity in The Deep. Following the warning from the Base's instruments, a searing white light and loud crash told them a nearby oil rig of the Consortium had caved in. The diners tore off their naval uniforms, donned diving gear and boarded rescue spheres. Led by shouts of \"M'aidez, M'aidez,\" they located the trapped workers and cut through the wreckage to them. The twenty minutes it took to accomplish the rescue seemed like an eternity.\nTom watched through an underwater window of the observation deck as aquanauts, led by their burly, mustached, security officer, freed the last oil driller from the wreckage of the rig. Then the officer, Seretse Khama, sealed off the site of the explosion with buoys and nets, and removed material samples for lab testing for bomb residue, substandard materials, etc. Aquanauts Union rep, Cindy Chudy, escorted the injured and their family members to motor boats that took them to the local hospital ship. She half carried a new wife, with eyes bloodshot from crying.\nSince they didn't need back up, Tom replaced his diving gear with navy coveralls, and prepared to begin the accident investigation from his federal research base. When the Council OSHA rep drafted him as a consultant, he asked,\"Won't that be a conflict of interest during the election campaign?\"\n\"We know you better than that. You are the most qualified for the job.\"\nHe must examine the lab testing and instrument readings results, and study computerized records archives, to discover the cause of this accident and prevent potential loss of life in future incidents. This additional responsibility cut into the time he budgeted to train his successor, Seretse, as administrator of the marine colony.\n\"I knew these people well,\" Seretse said, when he reported back. The oil drilling company brought jobs and prosperity to his country, Somalia, after years of plundering by warlords. What a mess the work site was in.\n\"We'll find the problems and eliminate them,\" Tom said.\nCindy slid down the pole to the observation deck. \"Three deaths, and thirty miners sustained injuries, because substandard equipment buckled and the rig collapsed. The Council must charge the Consortium with negligence, or we union reps will call a sympathy strike.\"\nShe refrained from pointing out that voters, unhappy over a rig accident and strike, wouldn't support Tom or a Consortium candidate in the campaign. To suggest politics would influence his actions in this situation would be insulting.\n\"First we examine the evidence, before accusing people of negligence. Besides, we don't want to ruin this project, if we can save it,\" Seretse said. \"In five years our Ocean Thermal Energy Converters will make drilling obsolete. Now people rely on that oil as a source of energy and income to feed their families.\" The OTECs delivered cheap electric power through differences in temperature - taking in warm surface water and then sucking up cold deep water. However Earth needed more than the prototype Ocean Base One to deliver enough power.\nTom agreed. \"The Council has shut down the drilling project, pending an investigation. Our committee needs to evaluate the evidence to recommend if the District Attorney should bring charges against the Consortium. Let's go to my office module.\" There they sat down on seats from coral, grown on the Base, and had an algae soup snack.\nIt didn't help the Consortium's cause that their financial officer\/senatorial candidate, Zara Ekberg, refused to go on camera with Tom or express sorrow to the families directly, as the aquanauts did. She scribbled a note to Tom on her e-mail pad, stating she felt the counselor from Human Resources would do a better job of handling that task, when the counselor arrived by helicopter from the mainland.\nAfter receiving the note, Tom shared it with his colleagues. Seretse scanned it, then frowned and studied it carefully. \"So, what does your training in hand writing analysis, tell you about this cold fish?\" Cindy asked. \"Would she cover up profiteering by her company?\"\n\"Graphology doesn't foretell an ordained future. We can usually identify the person who wrote a particular sample. Zara has distinctive hand writing, especially at the end of the message, when she relaxes.\" He handed Cindy the note. \"Look. Angular lower loops indicate resentment and hostility. Irregular slanting to the right then left indicate unpredictability.\"\n\"I know Zara,\" Tom said. \"She was pressured into becoming a candidate, by the Consortium. She prefers to function behind the scenes crunching numbers.\"\n\"Graphological analysis can give a profile of a person's characteristics and expected behavior in a given situation, but we have free will to control and change our behavior,\" Seretse said. \"We're not just stimulus-reaction robots.\"\nZara was present when they reached the office. The tall blonde ran over to Tom and buried her face in his shoulder. Cindy glared disapproval, at this evidence of potential bias. Then she frowned as she noticed the almost invisible surgical line from facial reconstruction surgery, as Zara's pearl necklace shifted. Usually Zara wore high necked clothes.\n\"I am confident that we will show the accident could not have been prevented,\" Zara said. \"Let me make a copy of the records for you.\" She sat down at the computer.\n\"OK to tape this meeting, Tom?\" Cindy asked. She listened intently to the other woman's Swedish accented voice and focused on her long, narrow face. Was Zara vain or was she one of many fugitives from justice? So easy to vanish by having plastic surgery on the face and finger print pads. The Internet even advertises how to set up a different ID, using computer strategies developed by the Witness Relocation Program. How will any of us behave, now that a different face and background allows us to avoid responsibility for our past actions?\nAt the end of the meeting, Zara took Tom's arm as they walked down the corridor. \"Don't scold me. I can't listen to the people, who become emotional over every unimportant thing. Let my staff listen to them. \"If you want to leave the Base, you would do much better in the private sector as a CEO.\"\nHe shrugged. \"The Base needs money. I want to explore space, one day. Living as aquanauts on Earth prepares us to colonize other planets.\"\nThat evening Cindy called Tom at home. \"Why did Zara have facial reconstruction surgery?\"\n\"Don't know.\"\n\"You can't talk, because you have a guest? OK. I looked through the Mackenzie trial video tapes. Remember that couple were indicted five years ago, for neglecting safety precautions, before an underwater mining accident. Zara resembles Mackenzie's wife, who testified against her husband, then escaped from the court room.\"\n\"You just don't like her.\"\n\"True. But the Base is relying on you to represent us on World Council. If I'm right, it is inappropriate for you to remain on friendly terms with her, during the investigation. You're handing your political opponents evidence to blackmail you with.\"\nDiscussing this disturbing information with Cindy, Tom realized she raised a couple of important issues. He replaced the phone and turned to his political opponent. When he asked for comments on this new information, Zara said, \"What Mackenzie case? I was in a car accident, so needed surgery,\" and stomped out of his residential module. She scribbled a note to a TV tabloid show, and faxed it through an untraceable public e-mail channel. The note accused Cindy of being AWOL from the army. The Aquanauts Corps placed Cindy on suspension, pending an investigation.\nSeretse compared Zara's notes with letters written by Mrs Mackenzie during the trial. He informed the civilian police that they were written by the same person. \"However, my evidence is not recognized in a legal court,\" he reminded Tom.\nTom visited Cindy. \"How could anyone believe this nonsense about you?\"\n\"Because it's true. When the Aquanaut Academy said they had no openings, I joined the army. One month later, I ran away from basic training, after I received a delayed acceptance to the Academy. I received only a fine and probation as punishment, because I was under 18 years old and officially a student, not a soldier. Now my entire army file has disappeared.\"\nTom felt very angry with Zara. He confronted her.\nZara cried. \"I only did it because I don't want to lose your friendship. I can offer you a job as Vice President with the Consortium. Cindy and Seretse have no proof of any crime, to put me on trial. Old videos and graphology won't stop me.\"\n\"Tell me the truth. What caused the accident?\"\n\"Who expected any seismic activity in this region. We'll change the design of the rig, to facilitate swaying instead of rigidity - like a skyscraper on land - to avoid future problems. Soon we will settle all the lawsuits out of court.\"\nTom went back to his computer. He had experience with computer glitches. However he was rusty. It took two hours to enter the army files archives, search for and locate Cindy's buried file, before it was permanently deleted. After six years on the Council, would he be able to return and make a scientific contribution to Ocean Base? Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.\nSince the AWOL occurred when she was a juvenile and she fulfilled the fine and probation requirements, the Corps reinstated Cindy. \"You can make big money from the tabloids, by exposing Zara,\" Seretse said to her at the morning meeting.\n\"Law suits have been filed against the Consortium. They are raising safety standards. I want us to win the election on the issues not by making accusations we can't prove, just to get even. Besides I may run for Senator, now that Tom's withdrawing.\"\n\"No, I'm not,\" Tom said.\nLater Tom had dinner with Zara, on her river houseboat. The Consortium transferred her to Switzerland. No evidence linked her to the present accident. However, the civilian police prepared extradition papers, related to the former charges.\n\"You are quiet. Let's go for a swim.\"\n\"This is good-bye, Zara.\"\n\"Leave Cindy to me. I'll see she keeps her mouth shut.\"\n\"And how many others will I have to threaten or pay off? A cover up always unravels.\" He no longer trusted her. She dived into the water.\nHe felt like a Siddhartha looking into the river. What was real and lasting about Zara and Tom, and what was constantly changing? Did differences among people generate power?\nOn election day, Seretse and Cindy hugged Tom as he left the voting booth. \"Good luck. Not that you need it. We have such confidence in you.\"\n\"Cindy, why don't you dump that workaholic as co-investigator?\" Seretse asked.\n\"Look who's talking,\" Tom said. They went to the gym and worked out, while watching the returns that elected him, Senator Ryan. At the party later, Tom pledged to his supporters, \"I will encourage new scientific developments through political action while in office, and then come back to this Base as an aquanaut.\" They erupted in loud sustained applause. He could get used to this.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Dictators do it by terror or by the inculcation of blind faith; the military do it by iron discipline; and the industrial masters think they can do it by automation.\"\n- Eric Hoffer\nMiddle-aged with a broad bust, silvering hair and bushy stray brows Reginald stopped scribbling, squinted and eyed the intruder from behind the posh cherry-wood desk. He didn't like to be alone. Reginald was not young, looked strong for his age, and he wanted folk nearby him. He fancied weaker folk, employees who could be managed. Examining somewhat tentatively around him, he scrutinized the thin little man who had already taken a seat. Weak enough.\n\"What is the nature of your call, Mr-?\"\n\"Hauge, Dr Seamus Hauge. Billions, Mr Marcus.\"\nStaring hard now, Reginald Marcus, president of International Medical Software Development, bit his lip. He felt like a huge wooden cockroach foraged in his stomach. Last night's partying with the board pantheon was apparently not punishment enough. And currently they had been the only staple of companionship around. His inflicted isolation lately, he hoped, would not debilitate him, turn him into another Hughes.\nThe heavy sweet aroma expensive Havana cigars are famous for, mingled with the scent of leather of the choicely Near East quality. Marcus wished somebody change places with him. He sank deep into the the leather chair. The office would commence to pirouette if he shut his eyes.\n\"Billions?\"\n\"Most appropriate, Mr Marcus, for the biggest medic software company around.\"\n\"That we are.\"\nReginald Marcus considered having an employer-employee talk with Ms. Atwood, his new, goggle-spectacled, personal secretary. Retirement had absorbed the older, more adept, Mrs. Parsons. Bless you, Mrs. Parsons, he thought, but your understudy dispenses protocol blindly.\n\"I do hope you remember.\" Hauge reached into his coat pocket and extricated a small white card. \"You had said, 'Show this card'.\"\nA vestige of recollection trundled in Marcus. \"University of Edinburgh?\"\n\"School of Computer Medicine - now doing a sabbatical at A & M,\" said Hauge. \"Hadn't explained half of what it's all about. Too busy looking over my shoulder and all last evening.\"\nThen and there, Marcus denounced Old Cherokee Bourbon and silently apologized to Ms. Atwood.\n\"You did say billions?\"\n\"Quite. Sir, you pioneer in treading paths no one has ever voyaged on before. Of course, you'll undoubtedly be facing competition no one's ever dealt with...\"\nMarcus was grateful for the man's garrulity. It gave him time to compose. Looking out the penthouse window, that was one of the four walls opposite the luxurious bar, he gazed upon the azaleas flooding onto the terrace, the pointed and cubed tops of looming skyscrapers with their mirroring or black windows, the steel and glass blocks of his empire where the thousands of men and women worked for him like sprightful ants scurrying every which way.\nMarcus nodded at the man: his newest and perhaps most lucrative triumph. If only Quasimodo would stop pealing those bells inside his head.\nHe reached into the pocket of his cashmere jacket. \"Want a couple?\"\nHauge looked at what Marcus was offering. Anti acid drops. They came in an etched container, carved out of white gold in the shape of a basket cockle. A modest diamond carapace was set into it. A pistil of blood-red was infused atop it.\n\"I don't mind if I do.\" Hauge took two. \"I say, we were a slight tipsy last night.\"\n\"A might.\" Marcus took a deep breath.\n\"It's a Mont Blane ruby,\" he said, fingering the blaring red stone.\nHis tenure just then carried the exaggerated seriousness of Malvolio in Twelfth Night. The container was small in Marcus's palm, but prodigious, substantial, potent.\n\"You do have an eye for the arresting,\" Hauge said. \"Excellent taste too. The braised liver with the onions was lip-smacking, and the chitterlings...never tasted anything like it.\"\n\"To our subject, Dr. Hauge.\"\n\"Quite.\" Hauge alternated his legs. \"It's a processor, to make a long story short. Somewhat different from a computer processor in that it learns and... and carries a certain, I might say, intrinsic leverage.\"\n\"Don't all?\" Marcus tossed four anti acid pills into his mouth. Haziness enclose him and thickened.\n\"Not all,\" Hauge said. \"Processors so far in the market are silicon and binary. They are made up of tiny transistors, switches, imprinted on silicon-based wafers which are activated to an on or off state by a trickle of current-\"\nA churning built up in Marcus's stomach, clutched for a time, then loosened. For a moment the upheaval seemed to wane. It was a rough landing, not like ever before.\nThe whipping in his gut built up again, gripped, expired. The pill holder shone. Its rainbow beams washed over him and nudged him five centimeters into the soft leather of the chair.\n\"Don't claim to be a pundit, but I am conversant with the subject of solid state electronics,\" Marcus said, showing a bit ruffled.\nHauge spoke over the wide desk separating them. \"May I illustrate further?\"\n\"Never say no to that.\"\nMarcus tolerated another brisk, vibrantly disorienting pang of nausea. He must look the worse for wear. His onerous, strained breathing patiently slowed down, but still tethered in pain. \"The stuff must have been poison,\" he mumbled, his heart hammering against his chest, keening to break loose from it. But Hauge seemed to no longer be attending him or his predicament.\nHe listened to Hauge prattle on about what he considered monumental, and rated him arch-ingrate. He thought that he would perish here, imbibed, maligned like an unsuspecting Napoleon amidst his empire; his immortality perhaps mere footsteps away.\n\"No offence intended,\" said Hauge.\nHauge looked relieved. Then lifted and high of heart. He now settled into his chair, relaxed, and seemed to appraise all that surrounded him.\nThe office was huge and plushly furnished and only a small part of the penthouse they were in. Soft music and singing was piped in that he recognized to be Bolivar, an old opera by the French Darius Milhaud.\nHauge upped his head and took in the vista of a quadrant of Dallas that lay beyond the enormous window, between an Apollo by Scopas and Orcagna's Madonna delle grazie.\n\"I only wanted to clarify a point,\" Hauge continued. \"My discovery is not silicon-based or binary. It's organic, neural-prosthetic implant or permanantly cultivated, DNA-protein-based.\" He produced from his pocket a black cube the size of a die. A thin pig tail of tiny electrodes ran off it. \"Uses quanta states instead of binary logic.\"\n\"No offence taken - son,\" Marcus returned. A candied Texas drawl garnished his voice. He craned forward for a better look. Landed a big one tthis time, his gut told him. On the spot assessment of multitudes of executives, yuppies and hirelings over the years and intuition had honed and sharpened his capacity for judging. Seldom did it prove him wrong. His ashen face once again started to bead with sweat.\nThe sun, rising behind the forest of buildings, had turned the cinemascope, polarized plate-window to sunset red - a lone, massive, vermilion ball, jabbed by black angular and sharp-edged protrusions, was only left to be discerned. The flat land and low granite hills beyond faded into a maroon dusk. Numbing out there, Marcus's thoughts now bandied about. The murky yellows, the glaring lapis blue sky, the dim harshness of the desert rocks and dust. The heat that makes the darkness ripple like black silk.\nHe had planned to leave today for Kruger National Park in South Africa to survey his latest acquisition there, a three wing hospital, purchased dirt cheap. But it could wait. So could Lanarkshire; that was a nine-floor, thousand-bed 'gift' from Glasgow, literally a steal. Competition better don their glasses, he thought.\n\"It works quite splendidly.\" Hauge interrupted Marcus's fixed look and raised the die higher. He regarded as Marcus got more deeply absorbed by the shades and moods around him. The hangover had run its course and would make things easier. Marcus looked to him dazed, and the eyes like two red puddles at the bottom of a dry well. Make hay while the sun shines, Hauge thought.\n\"Matter of fact its encapsulation is entirely too exaggerated. The active device inside is much, much smaller. It will be designed to interface directly with synapses. But the filament connections make it presently impossible to reduce further. Working on it. Its function? I'll demonstrate shortly.\"\nMarcus steepled his hands. \"About the billions.\" His attitude and diction changed, voice curt and brisque.\n\"No question about it. Everyone and their aunty would kill for one,\" Hauge preened. His listener attended mutely, so he cultivated the idea. \"Rather funny, but fashion rests on the most rudimentary supposition that has ever promoted a model of human trend: a majority of people will be imitated more often than not. Fads come and go. Not trustworthy. Yet in the long run a trend-varying populace will be imitated most of the time than not. The untouchable harijan, here, would want, and be able, to reach the highest Brahman-\"\n\"We're not Hindus, Mr Hauge,\" Marcus cut in, unsettled. \"Jean Cocteau said, Tact in audacity is knowing how far you can go without going too far. More pertinent, will the proponents of this trend have the tolerance to see it through to success and absorb the costs? Why, sir, would everyone want one?\" Marcus fumbled with the pill container again.\nHauge looked down the desk. \"Because we can make it from them for them,\" he said. \"A trend of fashion will catch on in some places like flash fire, and this can do it, Mr Marcus!\n\"A fad or here to stay?\" Marcus stubbornly inquired.\n\"Mr Marcus, what a question!\"\n\"A good one,\" Marcus retorted. \"A common mistake with technocrats is that they try to do away with, they say alleviate, human deficiencies. Aimless wriggling through the dark is what I say. Yet, and here's the paradox, they depend on these to make their bundle. They try to improve the system, and profit at the same time, by getting rid of it. Will your device provide to the degree that no other gambit is needed?\"\nHauge stared puzzled.\n\"Look, we've got problems in this business that all these gadgets put together cannot solve,\" Marcus said. \"Dehumanizing people to promote what is not simply a fad but a permanent fixture can prove not only unprofitable in the long run, but the most chancy and perfidious of all ventures risked. So, a fad or here to stay, Mr Hauge?\" The raspy voice was permeate with disdain, with harsh reservation.\nAnd your place in this snug paragon of corporate rectitude, Mr Marcus? Hauge itched to ask. But, for the present, he had to keep Marcus sweet, and thoroughly receptive.\nMarcus sighed. \"Your answer to my question?\" he asked, and eyeballed Hauge. \"Business, Hauge, ain't Pachisi.\"\n\"I don't know the answer,\" Hauge expelled, with calm gravity.\n\"I don't think you want it to be a fad,\" Marcus snorted. \"Biological engineering is only a step below cyborgs.\" Now an odious and distasteful look darkened his face. He reflected at the consequence of the precarious grounds Hauge was rummaging through, and the rip it could irrevocably rend in the edifice of popular consent.\n\"Don't know who said, 'boldness without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination'. That's burning ground, Hauge. The deep roots you talk about, are they perhaps the uprooting of other social strains?\" Silently, All the same, curious as hell to see what you're nuzzling up to... Then loudly, \"Want some coffee?\"\nMs. Atwood softly served the cappuccino.\nI must've been sloshed, Marcus thought. He grunted massaging his temples.\nHe put down one of the two silver and ivory tankards the secretary brought in, rose, moseyed over to where Hauge sat. His flat nose, his six foot three, two-twenty pound lean frame he hoped would hint at his beloved hobby. In his middle forties he could still get a few rounds in the ring without losing much wind. Other than by-the-book pugilism Marcus harrowed at all form of polemic art. But he loved to bluff. It gave him the edge over disorderly board meetings.\n\"Dr. Hauge, what's this about making computer components out of people?\" A look of stern reproach appeared on his face.\nThe other scanned the tower before him and sipped the last drops of his coffee. \"Not out of them, dear man, for them, like a heart valve, a skin graft from syntheticly cultured cells, plastic arteries, etcetera. Things that enhance, save people's lives as Pacemakers, artificial kidneys.\"\n\"Go on,\" Marcus said. He nudged near in another chair. Never had he been offered anything to compare with what this young man was offering. In his mind flashed a menagerie of cyberpunk images, endless queues of eager, nail-biting clientele. Meanwhile, dim circumspection tainted him with doubt. Visions of hacked, and patched up heads and defiled torsos paraded in front of him. But in the end he elbowed aside the stink of fear. He revelled at a euphoria of released capital fantasies.\n\"To put it simply,\" Hauge continued, \"a sample of the subject's DNA is got and blown up hologrammically in a computer. The cell nucleus and double helix is much easier to deal with that way...\"\nHauge thought of other things while he spoke. Something akin to hunger in that stare. A breeze of faith with a trace of sadness touched his face. It made Hauge's heart flutter. You never felt the bite of frost through torn shoes in deep Nor' Loch winter. Never had to eat stale bread and left-over mutton days unend in squalid, pest-infested, Auld Reekie ghettos to save up for coming tuition fees.\n\"...then the work begins. All genes not supportive to the preset parameters are neutralized and modified. Genes that heal the crippled, the blind, can make the deaf hear again; genes for mathematical acumen, for musical talent, for body stamina, business sagacity - you name it. The helix is then shrunk back down to its nominal size, superimposed on the original, and with the help of a broad-band laser beam is imprinted upon it...\"\nBlood, Marcus? Is that what you want? Hauge remembered his own skeletal, pinched face crimping in concentration over volumous texts. The explosive awakenings in the midst of nights by dreams in which cadavers he had dissected pursued him, threatening to fell him into so many lean strips. And that one child, the little girl, that expired in his arms slowly and lingeringly because the blood pool was empty and her parents could not pay Marcus, the world-wide provider of blood, for the rare, new blood. What new deal were you striking up, Marcus, at the time?\n\"Pardon my limited knowledge of genetics,\" at last Marcus wrenched in the luxurious chair, his hulking body coercing a tormented squeal from its frame, \"but won't that just change the original chromosome's physical shape and not its quality?\"\n\"Ah but it will. Chromosome is the name of the strange fellow: body of colour. Very sensitive to color frequency modulations. The modified facsimile will be color stained - coded with transparent dye where effective changes are desired, and by a mirror dye where not.\"\n\"Still, that leaves you with just one little, altered chromosome.\" Marcus stood up grinning, his argent hair wildly streaming and gleaming from the blowing air vent close above it, his pearly teeth teasing with their perfect dental work. He patted his lips with his index finger.\n\"That can, and will, reproduce its exact duplicate,\" Hauge came back, \"since the regenerative mechanism will not have been touched. Only, now, it will not produce dyed molecules, but genuinely different molecules that correspond qualitatively, as well, to their counterparts. Chromosomes don't know about illusion. Don't know that the original strain is dissimilar merely in color and not in essence.\"\nMarcus laughed, \"I didn't know such infidelity, especially in the case of artificial encroachment, existed in these minuscule workhouses. But the building of a complete helix from half of one - a split helix - is done, if I'm not mistaken, with the aid of an enzyme,\" Marcus said.\n\"I didn't either - a decade back. But at University we managed, piecemeal, to weed out that protein type and the aminos and anything else that could interfere.\" Hauge tapped at the die and its dullness dispersed.\nMarcus knitted his brows. \"Well, won't something else still rectify the mutated helix?\"\n\"Apoptosis - cell suicide? No. Now, the enzyme only constructs the mirror image of that which is in front of it from bona fide molecules. It does not compare chromosomes in doing so.\"\nMarcus shook his head. \"Hauge, it'll still give you a chromosome different from the subject's intrinsic physiology. Won't the body's defences fight it off?\"\n\"Does the immune system fight off radioactively mutated chromosomes, tissue for that matter? If it did we would have the cure for AIDS - for most cancers. Same principle holds true here. Furthermore, this is controlled and meticulously guided mutation. Not to mention that it comes from the same contingency as its host's inherent genes.\"\nTwo million years of conditioning, Hauge thought. The sun. The moon. Lightning. Fire. The piquancy of light and the seductiveness of color and what they incite, all pact into an irresistible live blend of rays. Symbols of a revered, supremacy\/servility evolutionary path. Ritualistic moulds of castes and adherents to combat-based values. All now exposed, unguarded, before the slued raptures of subliminal intensities and hues, bolting through the optic nerve. Visible phenomena that silently cuffed and castrated willpower, the id, the superego - the brain's very identity. At that moment, Hauge caught himself almost splendouring. He was engrossed in the force of power availed to him. It tickled within him that mysterious ember he called imagination. But only for a moment.\n\"And its quota?\"\n\"Mitosis, or cell division, is varied through a growth promoting and growth inhibitory signal genarator in pill form, controled solely by the subject's needs and by the subject alone.\" Hauge pinched two of the exposed fine wires on the end of the die's pig tail.\nMarcus saw the inside begin to whirl and soon turn to muddy grey, dull cream, and, finally, to diamond brilliance.\nHe got up and came close to look at the sparkling jewel the other held between his fingers. Coruscating sprays of rainbows caught, filled and kept his eye - his sight. Its pristine radiance bathed his retinas making him blink. A hot drop dribbled down his cheek.\n\"Sin, itself!\" he nearly drooled and kneeled before the Scot to have a better look. \"Where is the agent?\"\n\"A tiny shimmer - the star. Look hard, in its geometric centre.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"Body heat. It is attuned to the body heat spectrum. Enough to generate ample potential for the chromosomes to activate and act as catalysts to the liquid plasma pigmentation surrounding it, and then some. Here,\" Hauge said and pinched more wires. The liquid swirled, sparkled, spewed needles of sheen through space. It changed to transparent bloodstone.\n\"Get off your knees, old fellow,\" Hauge said, offering his chair. \"Take this too.\" He reached into his pocket. \"Shouldn't we get back to the billions?\"\nMarcus pinched and gawked.\n\"Are you with me, man?\"\nMarcus saw the die in his own hand turn into a green emerald, a blue sapphire, yellow citrine, fire opal...\n\"Eh, Yes. Absorbing sort of prettiness.\"\n\"So, pretty!\" Marcus's parched voice was weak and reedy.\n\"Er - you're in no condition to preside over the board, dear man. Oughtn't we let your board's directors know that you're postponing things? Till further word, let's say.\"\nMarcus rose weakly, walked to the complex communicator, punched the red button, said what he was told, and returned to his seat.\nMs. Atwood,\" Hauge remembered the little plaque on the slight, bespectacled secretary's desk, \"would you come in,\" he said, now bending over the intercom and standing behind Marcus' elegant desk.\nThe secretary entered, and riddled over the sitting man playing with his empty hands. \"So, so pretty...\" Marcus babbled.\n\"Is anything wrong, Mr -\"\n\"Mr Marcus will be leaving now. Oh, and, Ms. Atwood, would you be kind enough to bring your pad with you when you come back. We have changes to make.\"\nAn enigmatic expression cast on the young lady as she faced Hauge, sitting behind the great desk. For a moment, Hauge thought amused, she must have taken me for someone else.\n\"Yes, sir,\" she said, lingering her dispersed, fishbowl stare a while.\nThe Scotsman observed and humoured the other's fascination as she watched the die in his hand turn cornelian pink, hyacinth red, amethyst violet, lazurite blue, peridot green...\n\"Have one,\" he said, reaching again into an empty pocket, knowing it would be the most important thing on her mind from here on. \"Anything else, Ms. Atwood?\"\n\"No, oh not a thing, sir. So pretty!\" she chirped and gawked at her empty hand, sighed deeply and escorted her charge out.\n\"Ah, one more thing. Change Mr Marcus's flight for Marakesh instead, and accompany him personally till he boards.\" The climate should be more akin to Texas's, he considered, and put the one real die back in his coat pocket.\nHe always wanted to see how it felt to be a megatherium of business, unfettered to make and supply freely as much blood as needed for poor, needy people and little girls like his late sister, Margaret. But he wasn't sure if he had what it took. Clearly, though, all one needed was a dab of cheek and a spot of hypnotic power at his touch. Everything else then just couldn't help coming one's way.\nThe board members will be the true challenge, the Scot thought, when Ms. Atwood had left.\n\"Into the maelstrom!\" he hollered, and quailed at his own sound.\nIt was noon, the sun out of view, and the show-case window clear. Marcus's empire spilled once more before Hauge's surveying eyes. He'd have to call upon more compelling reserves than the die for the board. At that rumination, there was a knock at the door.\nA meek Ms. Atwood peeked in. She took off her bone-rimmed glasses with the thick, round silver lenses. The secretary's irises rendered an unexcelled performance that even a chameleon would have coveted to be capable of. Hauge quickly looked away - but not quick enough.\nMs. Atwood was careful not to look directly into the bar's inlaid looking glass on her left as she refitted the eyeglasses. At times like these, she thought, a mirror could prove woman's worst enemy.\n\"The saddest part of all this business, Mr Hauge,\" Ms. Atwood said, leading the catatonic man slowly out from behind Marcus's massive desk, \"is not recognizing your competition. Not inquiring why one needs to wear thick, silvered glasses inside this glare-free building. The naked eye, Mr Hauge, can often be quicker than your die.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

These maroons - the descendants of escaped Imperial citizens - scatter underground into a rock outcrop. The pilot, obeying a strange impulse, lands his flyer to photograph the monument's large stone idol. Walking around the site, he falls through a disguised covering above a stairwell, and discovers a stone chamber with an altar located beneath the surface idol. Acting upon another impulse, the pilot removes his flightsuit and lies down on the altar - into a depression which fits his body as if carved for it... He then falls asleep, without a care.\n\"Remarkable... It looks just like a neolithic site on Old Earth.\"\nThe two suited, helmeted visitors stood at the megalithic monument of Maarzha. Their suitcomm radios allowed them to communicate in the air they couldn't breathe. Nearby, their flyer sat on the sand, warming under the blistering sun.\n\"Yes it does, Professor\" agreed the younger man. \"But, of course, the maroons are Earth-descended, too.\"\nThe older man looked at him sharply. \"Are you saying there's a racial memory operating here?\"\n\"No... Nothing like that.\" The younger man - who looked a little like the fictional character, Indiana Jones - backpedaled. He was merely a civil servant employed by the Imperial military as an archeologist. The older man was a distinguished anthropological scholar who was quick to assert his assumed academic primacy.\n\"Places like this have been found on nonhumanoid worlds. The indigenies just used the same available materials to build their monuments as Stone Age Earthmen did, Doctor.\" He emphasized the civil servant's academic title a bit as an additional reprimand - but he kept to himself what he thought about government-men who held doctorates from hinterland colleges.\n\"Of course...\" But the younger academic had a nasty surprise for his new colleague. Something that would both set him straight about this place - and put him in his place. \"...Unfortunately, the natives didn't build any of this.\"\nThe Professor seemed dubious. \"They didn't?\"\n\"No... In fact this 'monument' isn't what it seems to be, Professor. Now that you're security-cleared, I can reveal the truth about it.\" He arched an eyebrow and paused, meaningfully.\n\"Yes?... Go on,\" replied the older man. He was annoyed that his younger colleague had sandbagged him with secret knowledge. That was why he was here: he was being paid to contribute his greater expertise. To save face, he muted his desire for the official \"truth.\"\n\"This should be interesting,\" he said. Although he scoffed at the military's obsession with secrecy, he was drawn to a good mystery and had endured the annoying security-vetting with patience.\nThe civil servant concluded the surface colloquy... \"Let's go below to the 'altar room.' The truth is more obvious down there.\"\nAs the two academics conversed before the idol, they were closely watched by a party of four maroons among the boulders of the nearby rock outcrop. All of them carried sheathed knives. The leader of the group also packed a radpistol in a holster. Unlike the others, he wore the remnants of a old military uniform. Despite its dirty, tattered appearance, it gave him an air of importance. His former military training had taught him the fundamentals of leadership. He was clearly respected by the others.\nLike the lesser-armed maroons, the leader was short, barrel-chested, thin-limbed, and very dark. Like them, his face was identical to that of the stone idol at the center of the monument. And, like the others, he was well adjusted to the brutal sunlight and the low oxygen level of the Maarzhan atmosphere.\n\"The pale strangers profane our sacred place,\" proclaimed the leader. The others grunted in agreement and scowled. \"One of them is new.\"\n\"Will the new one comply?\" asked one of the maroons. \"...Or will he reject, like the other?\"\n\"Both will comply - or they'll rest in the sand before their time,\" replied the leader.\n\"It looks like a simple sacrificial altar, doesn't it, Professor?\"\nThe older man was cautious in his appraisal. \"There are no drainage channels for blood, I notice, but the depression in the altar seems clearly designed for humanoids.\" He glanced warily at his colleague.\n\"Yes it is, Professor... For those of us it selects.\"\n\"What do you mean, 'selects'?\" He took a second look at the altar's depression. It had seemingly been carved for a short, fat man.... He was short and fat. The younger man was taller and thinner.\nHis face registered a look of shock. \"Y-you mean...\"\n\"That's right. It wants you, Professor,\" declared the civil servant, smirking.\nThe older academic was stunned into silence, during which his hands roamed over the smooth depression. His colleague used this silence to explain his startling remark.\n\"You see, this is not actually a place of worship, at all. It's ... an evolution station - we've had some trouble categorizing the place since we discovered its purpose. Behind those rock walls is a machine built here, we suspect, by an advanced race of beings who once visited the planet. By means, yet unknown, the machine brings about swift changes in any humanoid who reclines on that altar-stone. He's quickly transformed into a new 'native' of this hellish world, one who can withstand the fierce sun and breathe the thin air.\"\nThe Professor seemed incredulous. \"Really, Doctor!... I mean - how could this be?... Are you claiming this machine sensed me and formed a depression for my body before we even got down here?\"\n\"It did... The material of the altar isn't stone - but, rather, a petroid, electroplastic material. As I said, we don't know how the 'evolution' is accomplished - by radiation, probably. We're awaiting permission to begin studying the concealed machine, itself.\" He gestured toward the wall behind the altar.\n\"You're saying the Imperial maroons found this place and were all converted by a machine to a new lifeform capable of thriving here?\"\n\"It certainly looks that way... The local military called me in after one of their recon pilots apparently landed his flyer and came to the altar. The measurements of the depression they found were the same as his... He hasn't been found, so we believe he's joined the maroons.\"\n\"Why didn't this machine make a depression for you instead of me?\"\n\"It did that the first time I visited the place... Apparently, it gives each of us only one chance for evolutionary transformation.\"\nThe older academic considered this astounding secret. \"That's the most incredible thing I've ever heard... And, you're inviting me to join you in studying this place?\" His expression softened as he reconsidered the significance of this 'monument' to his academic career. \"I'm honored, Doctor. There's much to be learned here.\"\nThe younger man stuck out his hand. \"Welcome to SITFAES, Professor - the Special Imperial Task Force on the Alien Evolution Station.\"\nThey shook hands. \"Thank you... But I hope you don't expect me to lie on that altar and turn into a 'native.'\"\nThe civil servant laughed. \"No, no... We don't expect you to do that.\"\n\"Thank goodness.\"\n\"We'll get somebody else to do it.\"\n\"Oh...\" The older man's relief was tempered with some disgust at the military archeologist's intentions. \"...I see.\"\nHe took another look at his made-to-order depression on the altar, then said, \"Let's get out of here. Contemplating that thing makes me queasy.\"\n\"I know what you mean. I felt the same way when I first came here,\" replied the civil servant, sympathetically.\nWhen the two academics walked up the stairs into the brilliant white sunlight, the maroons were waiting for them with their knives.\nThe strangers had failed to evolve.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Now?\" She asked softly.\nI nodded in silent affirmation. She fingered the remote and the silent reality of night disappeared as the building was incinerated in a flash of light. She was enthralled by the light of the explosion in front of her.\n\"And we're out of here!\" I roared over the thunder of our work. I grabbed her and we bolted through the bush.\n\"Think we got anybody?\" she panted.\n\"Nah.\"\n\"Damn.\"\nI looked at her then and smiled inwardly. What a strange girl, I thought. How did she come to be with me again? This little viscous, bitter, gnasher of teeth. I couldn't remember. I guess it didn't matter.\nWe had just blown up the place of residence of one billionaire CEO. He wasn't there but we got our message through, \"Corporate America, stay away from our minds!\"\nYou're probably thinking, \"What the hell is he talking about?\" Well, back in the day, of say the mid 1990's, I came to the realization that business men were the conglomeration of all that was evil and putrid. I was, at the time, a quasi-neo-beatnik-hippie. That was 15 long years ago, before the fall of the United States Government and the rise of the Corporate America, acting as a government bringing order and keeping anarchy in check. The fascist had been planning that coup-detat since the days of Mike Eisner, who wrote the book on corporate \"fascism.\"\nWell the good old boys on top had taken power from the local and state governments. Their leaders were unethical and were hard to keep in check. Today they check on everybody else. people who dare complain about the iron fist rule of the corporations end up in the prison factories in the bowels of the cities. They forced terrible edicts, slave labor for criminals, forced caste systems and mandatory propaganda re-education. Our dignity and self respect was exchanged for CA's greed.\n\"The chopper's been hit!\" she said as she pulled on my pack.\nAs we broke from our stride I could see the wreck of our only ride in and out of here. The first reaction of panic lasted a few seconds. We were stuck on a guarded estate, whoever took out the chopper was probably looking for us right now. Chief Exec Adkin was probably very disappointed with us for blowing up his house and we were at least fifty miles from a safe house. All in all it was not a good situation. I switched into Computer Mode:\n\"Doria bust out the guns. Eyes open, they're out there and they're looking for us.\"\n\"All right, pops.\"\n\"Get ready to move. Perimeter search, looks like an ambush.\"\nShe could take care of any immediate problems. She had a sniper auto, a silenced machine pistol and explosives. I had to figure a way out of here. It wasn't impossible. It wasn't impossible. I just had to think, think fast. I just had to be smooth.\n\"Let's go,\" I said in my small voice. \"We're gonna hunt them down.\" Her glance at me said, \"Are you crazy?\"\n\"Listen, we'll take out one of their groups and use their GPS transponders to get out of the area.\" Their transponders were our passport out of Goth.\nShe found them. They were two miles north of the burning mansion. Two were ahead of the group and six were in the main body from what we could tell.\nShe knew the plan. I left her and approached the main detachment quietly. I crept in closely like a shadow. I remembered what I felt when I first did this type of thing. My heart would try to break out my chest as it beat harder and harder. Then it would be as if I were in some dream state. I couldn't feel my movements, I just moved. Time slowed down and anything was possible.\nNow as I came closer to the group I lost visual contact for a moment and I realized that it wasn't the same as back then. Now I was detached and unexcited. I took out my blade and prepared to spot and liquidate the enemy. That was the idea at least. As I cleared some brush I saw a soldier before me with his gun leveled at my chest.\nMy eyes raised as I thought, \"This is it.\" I didn't see his face. My eyes were focused on the heavy weight in his arms.\n\"Bastard.\" He snarled. He hesitated as if to request permission from his superior but thought better of that and smirked at me.\nAs I prepared to die there, there was a bright flash of light on the man's chest and I was blinded. The poor guy disappeared as an intense flame engulfed him. Behind what once was a soldier was another soldier, now exposed. I saw his mouth and eyes open wide as he fumbled his auto-gun towards me. I instantly moved into action deftly manipulating my blade into important nervous systems of his.\nAll of a sudden, it was as if it were clockwork again. The heat of Doria's gun woke the sleeper in me. I moved swiftly to my next target. I wielded my combat sword and saw it turn white as it reflected another explosion. I continued my motion and took off my opponents head. The flash had blinded me. I repositioned my self and prepared to fight sightless. I thrusted forward with the blade over my head. As I swiped downward there was another bright flare of brilliant light...\n'\"So what now?\" I asked as I looked on her intensely. I ignored the flow of people around us. The Airport was busy that day.\n\"I don't love you.\" She saw the pain in my eyes and she said,\"I can't love you,\" she tried to explain after. \"I'm too far gone.\"\n\"But I love you!\" I tried to say quietly. I was at the point of breakdown. My eyes that were on the verge of tearing, focused on her still.\nShe mocked me, \"I love you! I love you! I love you! That's all you fucking say. You don't love me.\"\n\"What were these last months to you, nothing? I can't believe that.\" She could see it in my eyes. She always could. My pain broke any attempt I made at being calm.\n\"I can't. It's not you. l can't love anyone. I'm just fucked up.\"\nShe was hard. She tried to hide her emotions from everyone, even me for a long time. But she let me in once. She just had to lock me out again.\n\"I'm sorry. Marriage is too much. I'm sorry I was stupid. Don't leave me Rebecca.\"\n\"Stop. Just stop.\" She turned halfway as if to leave and put her hand up as if to defend herself from me. She was blocking me out.\n\"You just don't understand.\" I couldn't say anymore. There was nothing more to say. \"I've got to go,\" she said.\n\"Go then. I'll be here.\" I lost her. I knew it then.\nShe looked at me for the last time and told me she'd write and I told her that I'd always wait for her.\nShe turned away and never looked back. I stood there. I stood there for a while. I couldn't do anything else. I don't remember leaving. I don't remember much around that time.'\nThe transponders we got off what was left of the troopers fooled the orbital tracking satellites long enough for us get out of the immediate area. We ran until the early morning. We found ourselves off the grounds and in a large urbanized area. We waited in an abandoned building for city traffic to slow down. It had the smell of neglect on it, of rain on old wood.\n\"What happened to you out there?\" Doria said with disapproval.\nI ignored her. \"Thanks, for saving me. \"I guess I'm losing it.\"\n\"Damn straight! You about lost your life, idiot.\"\n\"I blew it, but I got control back. Thanks again.\"\nI stared at Doria. I wanted to tell her that I didn't feel the same way about this business, that I was slipping. I wanted to tell her about my waking-dream of Rebecca. But I couldn't, I've never been able to tell anyone about her. As I admired Doria's beauty I started to compare her with Rebecca. They were both beautiful. Rebecca didn't hold the most perfect form, but the emotions I felt for her made her significant to me. Doria was different though. Her perfect form was not concealed by her dark body suit. She was forged hard through the lean years of war and persecution.\n\"Just one mistake...\" She said as she turned away in disgust.\n\"How's it look out there ?\" She asked a moment later, after she had calmed down.\n\"We'll leave after seven. We'll get lost in the crowds. If we clear the city we should be home free.\" Well that was the plan.\nWe dumped most of or equipment and started off in plain clothes. We piled into a railway southbound. So far it was working.\nAs we left the train we saw them. Doria walked to the edge of the elevated platform and motioned for me.\n\"Looks like trouble. At least twenty cops down there,\" she whispered. Just as she was telling me I saw a passenger pointing us out to an officer of the city. I pulled Doria and we started running. We gave ourselves away and the troopers on the ground started filing up the stairs. We ran through a crowd to the other side of the platform.\nWe looked a each other. \"Jump!\" We landed in some fresh mud and pushed on. We had a few moments. But we were two dirty, desperate looking people. There was no way we'd mix with the crowd now. We ran. We ran some more. It was just a matter of time before they closed in.\nA person in a doorway stared at me. He made eye contact. I saw in his eyes that he recognized me. Doria saw him too and approached him with her pistol in hand. \"Let us in, now\", she said with out saying a word. He moved inside staring at her gun and we followed.\n\"We're in a bad situation here, sir, so after you\" she said in a harsh, polite manner. He complied and we moved into his apartment. We went to a table and he stared at me. He didn't beg us to not kill him he merely watched me in amazement. He and I sat opposite to each other with Doria holding a gun at him.\n\"You can put that away. I think he'll cooperate.\" I stared and began to recognize him.\nThis was a strange happenstance. Our being here was too random and meeting this man was just unnatural. No man made scheme could accomplish the shock I felt.\n\"Lee? Is that you?\" He knew me.\n\"Yes, it's me,\" I said in amazement. \"You've gotten so much older, Abraham.\"\nI could feel Doria's eyebrow raise. \"You two know each other?\nWhat, is this a setup?\"\n\"Definitely not,\" I said. \"We used to go to school together.\nAbraham is one of my best friends. He was one of the fraternity brothers I really bonded with. You work for them now don't you?\"\n\"Yeah. I do. And you're doing... this?\" He held out his palm towards Doria's gun.\n\"Yup, since I last saw you, I think I've been terrorizing.\" I said and then pausing. \"I'm not ashamed.\"\n\"You seem so hard. What happened to you? After Rebecca you were never the same\" He looked to Doria. \"After she left he was a wreck. Lee, I remember you sitting outside staring at the sky forever, just waiting to die or something. Nothing we said could bring you out of it. And then you left. A lot of us thought you were dead and gone.\"\n\"That part of me is dead.\" I said flatly. I was ashamed. I was a kinder, gentler person back then. I was a fool. Or was I. I was more human then. I cared for someone.\n\"Who is this Rebecca?\" She asked both of us. I looked at Abraham and remembered. The wince of pain was unnoticeable.\nI did not answer Doria.\n\"Rebecca Lindsay. Her and Lee had a \u00d4thing' years back. Always together. I was happy for Lee but I never really trusted her. There was too much hurt in her.\"\n\"Glad to see that you were so observant.\" I said gruffly. He could tell I didn't want him to talk about that anymore. He went on anyways.\n\"Lee you helped her though, You were able to touch her.\"\nI said nothing. I didn't want to think about this ache. After a long silence Abraham spoke.\n\"Stay here for a while. I work for Corporate America, yes. I think I can get you out of here but now I have to go to work. Lay low until I get back. then we'll figure a way out of here for you and your friend. \"\n\"You gotta be kidding. There's no way you're leaving here.\" She looked at me and said, \"Let him leave so he'll rat on us?\" She reached for her gun and stood up.\n\"Doria it'll be ok. I'll trust him for the both of us.\"\nHe left and let us alone. Doria was jumpy. I had time to think. I had been killing for more than a decade now. My life had been Blood and guts and hate. I loved it. I loved the blackness of my heart. No mercy. No one loved me and I loved no one. It was easier this way. But what if I had died last night? I would have died a bitter unhappy person. All the joys and happiness that I had deprived myself would never be realized.\nI had to find a new line of work.\nI sat next to Doria and waited to get her attention. \"Doria, I don't think I can do this anymore.\" I saw pure anger in her. I almost reached for her gun just in case she lost her mind.\n\"You bastard. You can't leave me like that. Are you kidding?\"\nShe asked observing me closely.\n\"It's time\" I said looking down. When I looked her in the face she knew I was serious.\nWe looked each other in the eyes and the bitterness changed to something else.\n\"Please don't leave me. I need you.\"\nNow I had been thinking of leaving the business and her. She was the business. Doing this was all she knew. There was nothing left for her. I had to make my break. I had to get out of this stuff before I killed myself, before I couldn't, before I wouldn't want to make a choice like this. What would happen to her though? She looked so helpless. I could leave her just like that and start over. I wouldn't do that.\nOver the last couple of years I had grown attached to her. Besides her physical beauty she needed to be loved. She needed me.\nThe door slammed open and we jumped up from where we sat.\nAbraham found himself looking down the barrel of two angry guns.\n\"We got to get out of here now!\" There are three platoons downstairs looking for you.\n\"Damn...What else?\" I demanded.\n\"There is a tank troop rolling down the Eisenhower expressway! Listen, I think I can get you out. It's kind of risky...\"\nWe found ourselves on the roof of an Adkin Corporation building 60 stories in the air. In the distance we saw a blinking light. It was our transport according to Abraham.\nI squared up with him. I stared at him for a moment and then gave him my hand. I thanked him as I pulled him close to embrace our savior.\nDoria watched from behind me. We gazed at Abraham for a moment as he stood behind the clear elevator platform. The lighted floor gave his upper body a sharp silhouette as he descended into the floor.\n\"What now?\" she asked me.\n\"I say we move out of this place, I mean really get away from civilization. May be the Fiji Islands?\" I replied.\n\"And do what?\"\nI looked down and saw the immense dirigible that was right next to our building. As it passed under us I grasped Doria's hand. We paused there for a moment and looked each other.\n\"Anything we want.\" And we jumped onto the still moving craft.\n'Lee,\nI'm glad to hear about you and Doria! I wonder if your kids will kick ass too. Tell her I said hello and to put her guns down.\nI just wanted to say good-bye. It seems that one of my neighbors is a local intelligence agent, or rat rather. I have heard a rumor that I am to be prosecuted. I don't know what that will mean. I do not know if that is true. But I think so. I think they may be spying on me now.\nWhatever happens, please don't come after me. You both have put your guns in the ground. Leave them there. I will find my way.\nThis mail is encrypted, so by the time they de-cipher it you guys will have already left the Andes.\nGod's speed old friend,\nAbraham'","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Baldwin, Attorney at Law\" emblazoned in raised silver letters near the top. Harold and Harriet raised a fist to knock on the door at the same time. Harold glanced sharply at his wife and managed to rap twice before she could move.\nThe door opened, and a tall woman in a white lab coat stared down at the couple through delicate gold-framed glasses. \"Mr. and Mrs. Ahern?\" she asked. \"That's us,\" answered Harold, holding out his hand. \"I'm Harold.\"\n\"You're right on time,\" said the woman, ignoring the offered hand. \"Mr. Baldwin will be with you in just a few minutes. Please have a seat.\" She stepped aside and motioned the couple in.\n\"We saw your ad on t.v.,\" Harriet began shakily. \"You know, about the quickie divorces?\"\n\"Yes, of course.\" The woman walked over to the black metal desk in the corner and sat down. She flicked on a small halogen lamp and quickly flipped through a small stack of Manila folders on her desk. \"Ahern, Ahern,\" she muttered to herself. \"Here we go,\" she said finally. \"I need you two to fill these forms out while you're waiting. I'll let Mr. Baldwin know you're here.\" She got up and walked out of the room.\nA few minutes later, George T. Baldwin himself entered the room. He was a slightly-built man with mussed blond hair and bulging red-rimmed eyes. \"Sorry about the wait,\" he said, smiling broadly. \"I was in with another couple and their session took a little longer than I had planned.\" He sat down in the chair next to Harriet and leaned forward to talk to both of them. \"I don't have a real office,\" he explained. \"Most of what I do takes place in the laboratory. I don't like to deal with too much paperwork, think it's a waste of my time and yours, so I'm just going to talk to you out here and then lead you into the showroom.\"\n\"We're just here for a divorce,\" said Harold quickly. \"I don't think you need a laboratory to give us one of those.\" Harriet nodded in agreement, looking nervously at the door the receptionist had disappeared through.\n\"Okay, here's the deal,\" Mr. Baldwin said. He stared off into space for a moment and paused dramatically. \"A good thirty per cent of divorces end in the couple remarrying each other. People don't realize how much they need each other until they don't have one another, or something corny like that, but you get the picture. What we have in there,\" he pointed at the doorway, \"is our new state-of-the-art VDS, or Virtual Divorce Simulator. We can lead you through the first year of your divorce in about fifteen minutes by stimulating REM sleep electronically. It's perfectly safe,\" he added, noting Harold and Harriet's concern. \"And if you still want to get a divorce after the simulation, we can take care of that before you go home tonight.\"\n\"Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through,\" grumbled Harold. \"I can guarantee that the sooner Harriet and I are out of each other's lives, the better off we'll both be.\" Harriet said nothing, too busy looking down at her shoes.\n\"Then you'll agree to the Simulation?\" Baldwin challenged.\n\"Why not?\" Harold stood up and straightened his trouser legs. \"Come on, Harriet. Let's get this thing over with.\"\nHarold and Harriet Ahern stood shivering on the cold white-tiled floor, staring apprehensively at the two ominous black sleeptanks filling one end of the office. Tendrils of brightly-colored wires trailed out of the lid of each tank and disappeared somewhere into the next room.\n\"Generally, we have one person get into the tank five or ten minutes before the second person. It's easier for the computer to start the program in one brain at a time,\" explained Baldwin. \"There will be a team of technicians and a full medical staff monitoring both of you for the entire hour of your - trip.\" Two young men in white lab coats began fiddling with the tanks, connecting and disconnecting various cables. \"Well?\" he asked. \"Who wants to go first?\"\n\"I do!\" piped Harriet excitedly, grinning and raising her hand like a schoolgirl. Harold looked surprised, but said nothing. She modestly covered her breasts with one arm as a technician helped her remove her robe and climb into the first tank.\n\"Remember, this is just a simulation. Call it a dream,\" Baldwin said, leaning down to speak close to Harriet's ear. \"You can do anything you want - within reason, of course. You can't fly or change shape or that sort of thing. The computer isn't designed to handle those situations. But you can get yourself a new career or go to school or even remodel your entire lifestyle. Go ahead and enjoy yourself.\" As he closed the lid and pressed a large yellow button on the side of the tank, he leaned over and whispered, \"Sweet dreams.\"\nHarold glared down at his watch and began tapping his foot, irritated. This was not how he had planned to spend his afternoon \"Oh, don't be so impatient, Mr. Ahern,\" sighed Baldwin. \"Five minutes'll be up before you know it.\"\nHarriet climbed out of the tank. Her backside dripped the saline solution she'd been floating in. \"Did it work?\" she asked aloud. Her clothes were neatly folded on the floor beside her. She pulled on her dress and shoes, still looking around for the twenty-odd people who had been milling around her tank earlier.\nThe rest of the building appeared to be empty as well. The sky was growing dark; her watch revealed it to be eight o'clock. \"I guess this must be The Dream,\" she muttered, feeling suddenly self-conscious. Now what?\nThe streets outside were clogged with traffic. She opened her purse for the car keys before remembering that she'd given them to Harold. \"Damn!\" A wrinkled-up copy of the divorce papers, her bank book, and a few dollars were all she could find. \"Well, I guess I could go to the bank, get some cash, and take a taxi home.\"\nHome. She was a divorcee now, she remembered. She had already agreed to be the one to move out the house she and Harold shared.\nThere was always the \"new life\" bit. Excited, she almost ran to the bank, formulating plans. She'd get out of this hell-hole, maybe fly to California. She'd always wanted to go there, that exotic corner of the world where movie stars lived and her favorite birds migrated to every winter. California sounded wonderful just about now.\nHarold held his watch up for the lawyer's examination. \"Ten minutes,\" he announced.\n\"So it is,\" agreed Baldwin, looking from the rows of flashing lights he had been monitoring. \"I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Ahern. I completely lost track of the time.\"\n\"I can undress myself, thank you,\" Harold growled at the team of technicians fluttering anxiously around him. He pulled off his clothes, dumping them unceremoniously on the floor next to Harriet's clothes, and climbed the second tank. \"Ready when you are.\"\nShe could still get picked up hitchhiking without any trouble. She wasn't a bad-looking thirty-five. Harriet walked down the road backwards, thumb out, somewhere in Nebraska. It was easily a hundred degrees outside, but she resisted the urge to strip down to her tank-top. The roads were lined with endless spikes of corn and waist-high wheat grass. She hoped she could get a ride before her allergies started acting up. Or at least the simulation of.\nA badly dented blue Ford pickup slowed down and stopped twenty feet ahead of her. Gratefully, she waved and ran to the truck. \"Where'ya goin'?\" asked the old man at the wheel. He leered down at her through the rolled down window, his four remaining teeth chipped and yellow.\n\"California,\" she answered, trying to be pleasant. \"Hollywood.\"\n\"I c'n drop you off in Phoenix,\" grinned the man. \"You gonna be a movie star?\"\n\"Don't know,\" she shrugged. She slung her army duffel bag into the back of the pickup and climbed in beside him. \"Name's Harriet,\" she smiled, holding out her hand holding back an involuntary shudder as his greasy fist smeared with fried pork rind crumbs closed on her flesh.\n\"I'm Pete. Hope you don't mind if I drive real fast. We've gotta long trip ahead of us.\"\nHarold maneuvered his car through the impossible traffic and pulled into the driveway. The house looked comforting in its emptiness. \"Dirty movies 'til dawn,\" he grinned.\nHe turned on the t.v. in the living room and popped a frozen dinner into the microwave. He sat down in his favorite armchair and lit a cigar. Panda, their fluffy black-and-white Persian, meowed at the door. Harold opened the door and glared. \"You're Harriet's cat,\" he announced, and shut the door. Panda stopped meowing and ran to the neighbors' house for food.\n\"This is the life,\" sighed Harold, cracking open a cold beer.\nHarriet walked around the tackily-furnished studio apartment, sniffing at the stale air. Hollywood definitely had its own special smells. \"It's cheap, and it's in the safest part of town,\" stated the cranky old woman standing in the doorway, taking a long drag off her cigar.\n\"I'll take it.\" Harriet handed over the seven hundred dollars for the first month's rent and the deposit, barely containing her excitement.\n\"Thank you.\" The landlady bustled out of the apartment. \"If you need anything, just let me know!\" she shouted over her shoulder. Harriet sighed and flopped down on the dusty couch. She had almost six thousand dollars left in her account - enough for a cheap car and a few month's rent. She could easily find a job in that time.\n\"Anything can happen,\" she whispered to herself.\nHarold quit his job on the first-day-of-the-rest-of-his-life. The only reason he'd kept working so hard was to support Harriet, and she was gone.\nHe called a real estate agent the next day about selling the house. A newlywed couple came by with the agent later that day and offered Harold a flat sum of sixty thousand.\n\"Sold.\" Harold knew he could do better, but what the heck - this was a dream, right? He had a huge garage sale and got rid of all of the clunky old \"antique\" furniture and paintings and cute little knickknacks. It felt good, watching his old life disappear so quickly around him.\nHe kept a couple of his old suits and his best tie, just in case he needed work someday. But for now? He was Retired.\nHarriet finally landed a job modeling lingerie for older women. She felt a little apprehensive about taking the position, but she needed work and modeling paid very well. She never thought she'd get used to stripping in front of strangers, but Jon, the company photographer, had a manner that made her feel extremely comfortable.\nHarold bought the perfect house. You could see the Ozark Mountains from one window of the little brick cottage, and a small swiftly-moving stream through the other. He spent the first week in his new home dressed like a lumberjack and practicing on his accent. He wanted to leave New York far behind him; he wanted to belong to this world.\nHe sent Harriet's mother his new address, wondering how his former wife was doing without him to take care of her.\nHarriet missed Harold. Hell, she'd spent almost ten years with him. She wished they'd had children.\nShe called him at their old house two months after the divorce. A woman's voice answered the phone, giggling. \"May I speak to Harold Ahern?\" Harriet stammered.\n\"Who's this?\" The voice sounded very young.\n\"Tell him it's Harriet.\"\nThere was a sharp intake of breath, the sound of popping gum. \"Honey, it's Harriet!\"\n\"Hello?\" Harold sounded out of breath.\n\"If - if you're too busy to talk, I can call later.\" Harriet's hand squeezed the phone receiver hard.\n\"Don't worry about it. How're you doin'?\"\n\"Oh, I'm fine. I got a little studio apartment in Hollywood.\"\nHarold laughed incredulously. \"California? Geez, I'm impressed. You really wanted to get away from me, didn't you?\"\n\"Well, I guess we both needed some space,\" Harriet sighed. \"I was just calling to say 'hi' and see how you were.\" She hung up and lay wrapped up around her pillow, crying, for the rest of the night.\nJon noticed how puffy her eyes were the next day and refused to photograph her. \"The pictures would ruin your reputation as a model,\" he joked. \"You look like you've lost your best friend in the world. Sorry to use the clich\u00e9', but that's how you look.\"\nThe sympathy started Harriet's tears all over again. \"I think I have, maybe,\" she sniffled.\nJon put down his camera equipment. \"You are coming with me to dinner tonight,\" he ordered. \"And you are going to tell me what's wrong.\"\nHarriet responded almost immediately to Harold's letter. She'd found an apartment near their old house and was working as a receptionist for a construction company. She was very upset when she heard he had moved, and would like to fly up sometime to see his new place. If it was all right with him, of course.\nHarold didn't see anything wrong with that. The old girl was probably lonely; even though they were divorced, they could still be friends. They'd been friends, best friends, for at least five of the ten years they'd been married.\nHe arranged for her to fly up for a visit the following Saturday.\n\"Don't turn off the light,\" pleaded Jon as Harriet reached for the switch. She pulled her hand away reluctantly.\n\"I'm embarrassed,\" she confessed. Jon laughed.\n\"Harriet, I've taken hundreds of pictures of you naked. Why would you be shy now?\"\n\"You've never seen me naked!\" protested Harriet. \"I've always had my underwear on.\"\nJon kissed her forehead and smiled. \"I have a good imagination,\" he whispered, causing goosebumps to rise up all along the backs of Harriet's arms.\nHarold met Harriet at the Springfield airport. She looked slimmer; there were dark circles under her eyes from long work days. She put her bags down when she saw him and waited, arms crossed defensively across her chest, a little smile quivering on her lips. \"Hello, Harold,\" she greeted him, timidly. They hugged, briefly, like friends who hadn't seen each other for a long time.\nShe loved his cottage. \"Let's go hiking,\" she begged, eyes bright. They both put on their sensible shoes and headed out towards the giant blue mountains looming in the distance.\nJon brought his little boy, Jack, to the studio one day. He was as beautiful as his father had boasted: pale skin and wavy black hair and huge dark eyes. They all went out together to eat, and afterward, Jack fell asleep on Harriet's lap as they sat together on a concrete bench at the end of the Santa Monica Pier. Harriet stroked Jack's hair with one hand and leaned against Jon. He felt safe, safer than Harold had ever felt, even including the time they were still dating, when she thought he was \"Mr. Wonderful\".\n\"Are you happy?\" Jon whispered, putting his arm around her shoulders. \"Of course, stupid,\" she whispered back, giggling.\nIt was dark by the time they reached the base of the mountains. Harriet sat down and wiped the sweat from her face. \"I had no idea this was so far away,\" she panted. Harold flopped down on the soft grass beside her.\n\"Me neither.\" He looked up at the emerging stars and sighed. \"We won't be able to make it back before midnight.\"\n\"Let's camp out here,\" Harriet suggested. \"We could build a fire and just sleep outside. The weather's perfect for it,\" she added, stretching out on her back. \"I never knew there were so many stars.\"\nImpulsively, Harold brushed a loose strand of hair from Harriet's face. \"You look real nice,\" he whispered. \"I guess I sort of missed you.\"\n\"I kind of missed you, too.\" She kissed his fingers as they traced her lips. \"Let's just sleep,\" she said. \"I just want to sleep with you.\" She rolled over and over until she was snuggled against him, her soft hand resting on his chest. He wrapped his arms around her and squeezed gently, inhaling the fresh scent of her hair.\nHarold woke to total darkness, suffocating from the heat of his own body trapped in the metal tank. \"Let me out!\" he shouted, pounding against the lid with both fists. Blinding light flooded his eyes as two technicians helped him out of his prison. \"Where's Harriet?\" he gasped, shaking the fuzziness from his head.\nGeorge T. Baldwin, Attorney at Law, got up from his chair and strode across the room. \"She left, Mr. Ahern,\" he answered. \"Sign here.\" He handed Harold a small, neat stack of divorce papers, Harriet's crisp signature blackening the top sheet.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

She received a coveted position as a diplomatic intern. Usually that went to experienced officers.\n\"They're trained to blend. Maybe something's wrong on Lothia.\"\nThe intern, Marion Stern, reached the same conclusion. She joined Space Corps for the Academy education and the opportunity to develop leadership skills. But she didn't volunteer for suicidal missions. She went to Colonel Kim's office in the next sphere.\nA long time ago, Juvenal asked,\"But who is to guard the guards themselves?\" The Corps were still asking that.\n\"Ambassador Andrew Mackenzie denies he broke the law, and interfered with the coming political election of the colonists,\" the Colonel said. \"During your diplomatic internship, evaluate the Lothian situation and report back to me.\"\n\"Because Mackenzie reduced the threat of civil war, the people regard him as a hero. I want you to tell me my objective in gathering information, and my exit strategy.\" Nobody likes a snitch. The powerful, politically active Mackenzie family owned patents on new technology that recycled energy waste. She noted a picture on the wall of Mackenzie and the Colonel, when they were Academy karate champions. The Scot had a long, serious face and mane of yellow hair. The burly Korean smiled, as he waved the team trophy. Did Kim accept that his friend might be punished?\n\"My background is in health care not law enforcement,\" she continued. \"Let's say Mackenzie thinks he's God, who's going to restrain him?\"\n\"The plan is for you to investigate and report, Lieutenant Stern, not to challenge Mackenzie to martial arts combat. In this assignment, your primary work (75% time) will be to teach the Lothians to use chi therapy. The terrorist attacks on atomic power stations have inflicted radioactive injury on the children.\"\n\"Why didn't you say so?\" Obviously she was the one for a chi therapist assignment. She could evaluate the political situation on her day off from the clinic. \"I'll leave at once.\" They shook hands.\nBack to Lothia. The planet her parents escaped from in terror of the Assassins.\nShe tried to present reality to the Ambassador at the fundraiser on Lothia, when she saw the posters with 'Vote for Mackenzie.' He worked the crowd, joking and shaking hands, \"Call me Andy.\" That performance showed why people nominated him to be planetary rep.\n\"We're Observers, Andy. Who selected you for Dictator of Lothia?\"\nThe music theme indicated time for the finale. Gliding onstage, Andy said, \"Thank you for attending this benefit for our war orphans.\" He held the children in his arms. Marion released a pulse of chi energy from her fingertips that broke up radiation toxins in the child. They treated a dozen patients then said, \"Come to the health clinic. No more war,\" and waved goodbye to the cheering audience. Many of them clutched Andy K9, or Captain Mac toys, bought to benefit the War Orphans funds.\nThe ex-Governor Rafe stopped Andy. \"You didn't attend our last Party meeting. We want you and Space Corps Officers to go back home, where you belong.\"\n\"Find another job. The Founder's Party is finished. I refuse to betray Lothian's elected government.\"\n\"Collaborators with Earth will be banished.\"\nLeaving them to argue, Marion entered the cabin of the shuttle. She hoped the TV exposure would encourage patients to attend the free clinic. In a corner, lay two unconscious men. A poster above them said, Founder's Party Forever and had a picture of The Founder. He resembled Andy more than the scholarly Rafe.\nThe happy audience from the arena could become a howling, angry mob and turn on strangers like Marion. The fragile post war alliances would disintegrate. She closed the shuttle door and took off. Randomizing the tunnels chosen, she aimed at the health clinic an outpost in the desert area. Next she sent an SOS signal to Andy, the clinic and the police.\nAt the clinic, they used Lothian medicine and chi therapy to treat the patients. \"Why bring them to Corps territory?\" Andy said. \"They should have been left under Lothian jurisdiction. I allegedly broke regulations to prevent civil war; you broke regulations to prevent a riot. I'll report you to Kim.\" The patients recovered and told their story to the police about being robbed by masked thugs.\nWhy was chi therapy difficult today in the arena and clinic? She felt an electricity in the air and sent an e-mail message to Kim. Andy read it over her shoulder. \"What difference does it make, if the planet is passing through an ionic storm?\"\n\"I don't know much, but maybe the Corps does. A storm affects adults like a strong stimulant.\" The visitors to the planet sweated a lot and had a fast heart rate and breathing rate. Except Andy who reacted like a member of the colony, born on the planet. If Andy had Lothian relatives, this might bias his decisions in their favor.\n\"The Lothian news programs tell us, planetary war is the next step.\" Andy switched on the Look-C and placed a sensor on the globe of Lothia. The screen showed a man seated in the Spaceport adjusting an artificial right hand. \"Ex-Governor Rafe: injured fighting off assassins. Years ago his father murdered all the important candidates who opposed his own election.\"\n\"Tell me about it,\" she said under her breath.\n\"So their families killed The Founder and hunted down his family.\" He moved the sensor and a different screen showed a group of tanned, refugee children exiting a plane from a troubled area.\nMarion Stern's face remained set in stone. No wonder the Corps sent her to check up on Andy. His new adaptation of the Look-C enabled him to tap into all the surveillance cameras on Lothia. What next? The Corps isn't wise and good enough to handle unlimited power over other human beings.\n\"Your specialty is health care,\" he continued. Let's end the war and help them recover. Who cares if we break a couple of regulations. Besides I have an arrangement to work with the company that conducts authorized surveillance in the public area of Spaceport. Part of our anti-terrorist initiative.\"\n\"Send a request for written authorization to tap into those cameras to Corps headquarters. However, I believe that your next step could be to rob the colonists of their privacy and obtain information to influence their decisions.\" Marion could feel the excitement in the cabin. She left to meditate and place a cone of energy around herself to neutralize the environmental probes of the Look-C device.\nShe sent another message to Kim documenting her observations that Andy ran for office in local elections. He also used devices to conduct surveillance on people. Kim sent back a recall and replace Mackenzie order.\nAndy practised his election speech. \"People of Lothia, we are ambassadors from Earth. End this war, or you will destroy your planet.\"\nMarion handed him the orders from Kim. Andy grabbed the Look-C and beamed down to the planet. The Colonel didn't appreciate this bad news report or its messenger. \"Lieutenant, find him.\"\nShe followed Mackenzie: a compass across the emptiness of space, and found him sitting in meditation on the grass, next to a full size replica of Old Earth's Stonehenge. She walked up behind him. \"Colonel Kim sent me. You have to answer for your actions.\" He remained silent.\nHer beeper paged. She aimed the image at the grass. The Lothian Central Committee appeared with Kim. \"As you see, Captain Mackenzie and Lieutenant Stern are enjoying a well earned rest on vacation,\" Kim said. What vacation?\n\"The Lothian people have arrested terrorist leaders and canceled approval for the War Powers' Act. They refuse future access for the Look-C, as an invasion of privacy. However they signed a treaty to provide a refuel\/recycling energy center for Space Corps. The Corps orders you both to return immediately.\" Andy put his arm around Marion and smiled at the camera.\n\"Marion, you have been appointed my assistant,\" Kim said \"while I remain on Lothia as acting ambassador. Mackenzie will take over as liaison and P.R. resource for the new Recycling Energy site.\"\n\"I can't return if the Look-C is to be used,\" Marion said. \"Even if it means disobeying a direct order.\"\n\"You were right. It's destroyed and we won't rebuild it,\" Andy promised. Kim and the Committee agreed, then signed off.\n\"I thought you would be jailed for disobedience. Now you're promoted to a high paying job as a liaison.\" Perhaps that was their plan all along. Now she was becoming paranoid with a conspiracy theory.\n\"Even Space Corps officers can't be trusted with too much power over others. Some of the issues you raise, I intend to put them on a TV news show. Marion, your questions are annoying, but you make me think.\"\n\"Prove it by your actions. Others know how to make a Look-C. Work with designers to develop privacy cones to neutralize it.\"\nAndy's eyes had a far away look, as he considered the challenge.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I'm back on Zartos. Apparently, I'm here fifty years after I left. In front of me is a monument dedicated to, ahem, my film acheivements. Apparently it is haunted by my spirit. This must've been one of Lucy's tour spots. So what, was he planning on having Beezle do me in so I could haunt the place? I don't know. What I do know is that I'm going to get my butt out of here.\nAre you wondering about my alien baby? I know that I haven't mentioned him since I was gotten with child. I'll tell you. Hybrid children have a longer gestation than human children. I've been with child for about nine months. However, I'll still be with child nine months from now and nine months after that. Gestation is approximately 36 months. Heck of a thing isn't it? I never wanted babies. Ah well, such is my life.\nShoot, Beezle just popped up across the courtyard. Hang on sis and maybe I'll get to finish this letter.\n\"Beezle baby, there you are snoogums!

I'll be right back lambie.\"\nI said I'd tell you about how I get these letters to you. It is a device that I picked up, lifted, my first time on Zartos.

Well, I'm standing in front of my house watching myself get abducted by aliens. Lordy, I forgot to tell you about those awful curlers I was wearing. Lucy, do you remember those huge plastic hand me down curler mom gave me? Those are what I had in my hair. Plus, that nightie I was wearing barely covered the essentials. I am so embarrased.\nI must be getting close to figuring this thing out since I at least got my house. Now, if I can just get out of one those time paradox thingies, I'll be okay. Let me see, I have to get my house, current time, no other me running around, and everything should come out okay. That is going to be easier said then done.\nOh, you might be wondering why I haven't been noticed by my other self or the aliens. I don't know if I mentioned this before but this doohicky apparently makes those standing in a certain radius unable to be detected. As far as I understand these things, I did get a D in Science, it has something to do with light rays. But hey, I don't know if that is true or not.\nLucy, darling sister, I think I have it figured out. Of course, no matter the outcome, I'm sure that you'll be hearing from me.\nMina","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

And it was more than just a memory for him, a mere electrochemical reproduction of a past event, it was a lifesaver that he'd clung to whenever the tidal waves arched over him. Now that the sea of his life was serene, it was time for him to validate the memory by passing on the lifesaver in his turn. Otherwise, nothing would happen.\nHe took his right hand out of the pocket of his black raincoat and knocked on the door, his pulse exploding in his ears like fireworks.\nThe young man who answered the door was Henry's height. Henry knew, of course, that he was duly twenty-eight, just half his own age, but he wasn't prepared for just how young he would look. How young and frightened and alone. Young men nowadays were so arrogant, they knew everything. They were invulnerable. This one, on the other hand, was more like a highschool boy by comparison.\nHenry knew how he felt. He wanted to put his arms around him and comfort him and give him the lifesaver that had once been given to him, but he knew that it was too soon: the young man would be too embarrassed and terrified to accept it.\nThe young man just stared at him as though he were in a daze. It would pass in a little while, Henry knew.\nIn the meantime he stepped into the apartment and looked around. It was all exactly as be had remembered it, of course, except the details. It was as though all these years he had been visualizing a sketch for a theatrical set and now he was actually on the stage itself.\nHe walked over to the mahogany desk and touched the grey-green Olympia upright typewriter lovingly, as he might have touched the face of Nancy or their baby son. All the plays he had written on his upright typewriter, all the radio commercials and brochures and ads. All the hopes and dreams that had been poured into it. All the failures and disappointments and heartbreaks. He remembered, too, the writer's blocks that had gone on for months soit had seemed as though he would never be able to write again. But that was in the past. Now that he had gotten through it all, thanks in part to his lifesaver, now that he was here, instead of there, all the memories, even the most painful, were suffused with a kind of nostalgia that softened the pain and made it more tolerable.\nBut not for the young man. Not yet. Not for a very long time to come.\n\"I haven't seen one of these in years,\" he told the young man, who had followed him into the living room. \"I use a computer now.\"\nHe had remembered that the young man wore his dark brown hair closely cropped, but it still seemed strange to Henry, especially in contrast to his own long grey hair. His blue eyes now seemed unusual in someone with his complexion, they appeared even more intense than they actually were. His lips were thin and clamped tightly together, as though they were zippered shut.\nNow Henry noticed the ashtray overflowing with smoldering butts sitting on top of the typewriter. He picked it up, walked to the open window and dumped its contents outside.\n\"I used to do that all the time and once spent hours cleaning up the mess after the ashtray cracked apart. I almost set the whole place on fire.\" He put the ashtray on die window sill. \"I gave up smoking years ago, you'll be happy to hear.\"\nBefore he forgot he had to get the hook, he walked over to the battleship grey steel shelving that held the young man's books. He was the kind of person who was very meticulous about keeping his books in alphabetical order by author. It was absurd, really, because every time he added a book to his collection, he had to move all the books after it. But it did make it easy for Henry to find Marquand's Point of No Return; it was right where it had always been, between Malamud and Maugham.\nIt had been so long since Henry had held Point of No Return. As he flipped through it, be couldn't help smiling as a wave of excitement washed over him. Suddenly, he was twenty-eight again and reading Marquand's novel for the first time.\nThe young man was still staring at him.\n\"Do you mind if I take this back with me? I gave my copy away to someone a long time ago and now it's out of print.\" The young man nodded mechanically, as though he were still in a daze.\nFinding the book was like meeting an old friend you hadn't seen in years, and Henry tucked it under his arm to make sure that in the emotion of the moment he didn't leave it behind.\nHe looked around the living room once more.\n\"I still can't believe I'm here.\" Then he looked back at the young man. \"I can't believe it's you.\"\nHenry's words seemed to snap the young man out of his trance. \"Who are you?\" he asked.\nHenry had been expecting the question, naturally, but it wasn't time yet. Not quite yet.\n\"Do you mind if I sit down? I've been traveling a very long time.\" The young man would not believe how long it had actually taken him to get here, at least not at first. Henry almost didn't believe it himself.\nThe young man nodded and Henry perched on the edge of the dark brown tweed sofa. The young man sat in the spindle back chair in front of his mahogany desk.\nHenry looked around the room again. It had been such a long time since he was here last, He had forgotten the little stainless steel sculpture of a bird and the Joan Miro print.\nHenry rubbed his hand along the tweed-covered cushion beside him. Nowadays everything was synthetic - polyester, acrylic, olefin - but this sofa was made in the days before man-made fibers became popular.\n\"They don't make them like this anymore,\" he said and then found himself stumbling over the young mans name, Hank. \"You'll never know how strange it feels calling you that. I used to be called Hank too when I was your age.\" Nowadays nicknames were out - everyone was Michael or Richard or William - so, of course, he was Henry.\nHe ran his hand along the cushion again.\n\"I came here to tell you that everything's going to be all right.\"\n\"Everything?\" Hank asked, the fear in his intensely blue eyes shading into hope.\n\"Everything you're scared about.\" The hope in his eyes bobbed to the surface like a Ping Pong ball released at the bottom of a lake. \"You mean I won't be fired?\"\nOh, Hank, the older man thought. I wish I could tell you that, I wish with all my heart I could tell you that. He felt his obligation to tell the young man the truth being undermined by his desire to comfort him.\n\"No. You'll be fired tomorrow. You'll also be fired from your next job too. You're going to go through years and years of hell before you get your act together.\"\nThe bright ball of hope sank below the surface again.\n\"Get my act together?\" Hank asked, puzzled.\nHenry had forgotten how parochial slang can be, but decided not to explain the expression.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"How do you know all this?\"\n\"I've been through it already, Hank.\" He knew what the young man had been thinking just before he knocked on the door and he had to keep it from happening or nothing would ever happen for him again.\n\"All the times I asked God to take my life, the few times I tried to do it myself - I'm so glad now nothing happened. That's what I wanted to tell you, Hank. Grit your teeth, you'll make it too.\"\n\"Who are you?\" Hank asked a little more insistently.\nNow was the time, Henry knew. He put the book on the sofa beside him and stood up.\n\"There's something I'd like to do before I go. You probably won't understand it, btit it's something that someone did to me when I was your age and it helped me get through a lot of tough times.\"\n\"What?\" Hank asked and he stood up too. He appeared shaky, as though he were about to faint.\nThis was the delicate part, because if the young man panicked, then Henry would have failed and it would all be over.\n\"I want to bold you for just a minute. I want to tell you how much I love you, Hank, bow much I I've always loved you. I want to assure you that everything's going to work out in the end.\"\nFor a moment Henry felt as though he were watching a movie whose film had jammed in the camera, freezing a single unmoving image on the screen. Then the film lurched forward and Hank walked stiff-legged across the room, like a person on stilts, and stopped in front of him.\nHenry put his arms around the young man and drew his thin body up against his own flabby one. At first it was like holding a tree, Hank was so tense and unyielding. After a while his body relaxed. Henry held him as tightly as he could, trying to confirm how much he really did love this young man.\nThen he let his arms drop to his sides, picked Marquand's book up from the sofa, tucked it under his arm again and turned to face his namesake,\n\"I'll be waiting for you,\" he promised.\n\"Who are you?\" the young man asked once more.\n\"You.\"\nThe first thing Henry did when he got home, even before he kissed Nancy or Hank Jr., was to put Marquand's book in the space waiting for it on his battleship grey steel shelving, right between Malamud and Maugham, where it had always been.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Long they walked, silent, feeling the cool salty breeze buffeting them amid the calming sound of the breakers.\nBut time does not stand still, not even for the Krangok.\nThe coastline they walked was like many others, on many other worlds. Sugar white sand met the never-ending march of waves. Like time itself. And yet it was different.\nUnder the star filled sky these coastal waters glowed with a purplish sheen from the billions of tiny creatures who lived and died just under the surface.\nIf not so completely alone, the way they had planned it, the two solitary figures would have presented a picture most unique in this coastal setting. Two graying warriors of the Krangok dressed in old and faded uniforms, as if ready for some ancient ship-board inspection, except for the missing footwear they had left behind where their walk began. So they continued, side by side in an easy familiar gait.\n\"I never thought this day would come, Changra.\" Renal's voice faded on the wind as he stared over the dark waters that met the universe somewhere on the distant horizon , kissing the sky. His weathered eyes narrowed, making pronounced his deeply etched wrinkles.\nA wave, bigger than the rest, sent the thickly foaming remnants of its strength up around their ankles. Their feet and ankles engulfed, they felt the strong tugging force as the water returned quickly from where it came. Standing still in the swirling foam laced waters, they felt the tingling sensation as the sand under their feet eroded and gave way to the tide's irresistible power. But they stood fast, as if fighting the force of time itself.\nChangra laughed silently.\n\"Share your humor,\" Renal asked, he too wanting to avoid the reason for their really being there.\n\"Imagine... my building a house within sight of an ocean like this.\" Changra smiled. \"And I would walk on its edge every evening. And swim in it every day.\"\n\"And you could be happy... living on just one planet?.\" Renal asked with disbelief.\nAnd the pressing matter at hand would not go away.\n\"This pain strikes deeper than a hazor blast. More even than forty strokes by barbed whip.\" Renal said with feeling. \"And you know I have taken both.\"\nChangra chuckled enthusiastically now.\n\"Yet, recall it was I who nursed you back from that blaster wound all those long, tedious weeks, enduring your endless whining! Tending you like an old mother gahen.\" Renal raised his hands in mock defense as Changra continued. \"I too received the forty strokes... plus one from the Andarian's on Jissus V. And if memory serves, it was your mistake that brought it on our backs!\" Changra's words reminded.\n\"You'll never let me forget that will you, you old Sargus hound!\" Renal said.\nThey laughed again at the shared memories of long ago until the crashing of the waves drowned again all sounds. Renal looked up at the wide star-filled sky.\n\"We have known each other more years than there are stars in this sky, my friend.\"\nChangra nodded. \"Oh yes, and many more. And all of them good!\" He added with great sincerity.\nIt was Renal's turn to burst out with laughter.\nChangra's eyes narrowed but the gleam in them belied the firm look on his face now. Renal's uncontrolled laughter grew louder. Changra tried to fight the smile that finally flashed, brought on from the contagious sound.\n\"Well, most of them were good.\" Changra admitted.\n\"The exploration of the Tradian system...\" Renal raised a knowing finger. \"That was a time!\"\nChangra rolled his eyes. \"Yes, I had put that deep away and buried it.\" Changra shuddered. \"That was the closest to death we ever came.\"\nThe two old warriors, the two old explorers, looked at each other as if for the first time.\nRenal wore, for the first time in recent memory, the uniform in which he had received the Star of Coronium, highest honor of the Brillian's. The blue color had faded with time, but the gold of the emblem still shone under the bright starlight.\nChangra too wore something of the past, from one of the early, great journeys among unknown stars. Oh, so long ago now.\nAn unseen bird above them squawked in its flight.\nChangra drew his body up as if on military parade. His face grew harder at the deed ahead. And then he felt the great emptiness that stabbed his heart.\nBut Renal spoke quickly, cutting him off. \"I do not think I can do this thing.\"\nThey stopped together and waited amid the eternal sound of crashing waves.\nAt this mighty juncture they paused in awkward indecision, afraid to go further... but unable not to.\n\"We have each been given a great mission, my friend. The highest honor, orders from the Supreme Leader himself!\" Changra said at last with chin held high.\n\"We are too old.\" Renal answered simply.\nChangra's eyes narrowed as he hesitated only a moment. \"We... are the best!\"\nTheir eyes locked and each smiled in shared amusement.\nBut Renal's smile quickly evaporated. \"That is not what I am afraid to do.\"\nRenal'a eyes again became far off as he looked back to the shimmering seas.\n\"We shall not say...\" Changra, the accomplished speaker, paused in surprise as his voice cracked and became lost. He fought his burning embarrassment as he coughed, trying to find his voice and speak his carefully chosen words.\n\"We do not have to say... goodbye. We need only wish the other success... and a great journey.\"\nRenal's words leapt from his mouth. And his old warrior's heart.\n\"We go to the edge of the known universe and beyond! Each Captain of our own vessel! Each to the opposite ends of space!\" Renal's voice sounded angry even to himself. He paused as he raised his hand and stroked his beard. He continued, his voice now subdued. \"Even a Krangok dies.\"\nSomewhere deep inside something happened to both. Like a star suddenly going supernova.\nChangra suddenly grasped Renal's shoulders in a mighty grip. At first Renal felt puzzlement, for Changra's hands dug so hard into his arms that he felt he was being attacked! Had Changra gone insane?!\nThe two stood fast before the other, and suddenly they felt that overwhelming power that they could not stop. It began to push them forward. Changra's grip tightened further as Renal now grasped his shoulders in return.\nThere they held fast, fighting against the impossible.\nOnly for a moment.\nAnd they both knew it.\nChangra, the man of words, had no words now. As they stood there, face to face under the canopy of stars, it was Renal who finally spoke for both.\n\"No matter where this long journey takes me, no matter what forms of life I meet.\" He smiled. \"I will tell them that I have a friend. Though you are untold quadrants away, I will tell them... of you.\" He nodded silently to himself. \"And they will laugh as I speak of our many adventures together, and they will cringe as I tell of the mighty battles that we have fought together. I will tell of the years, the ages, that we have shared together. And they will know that you... Changra... are my friend.\"\n\"Of all the things that I have lost in this life, of all the things I dearly miss,\" Renal's pointing hand began to shake ever so slightly, \"you will be what I miss most.\"\nChangra stood there silent. Many of his own speeches came to mind, great oratory, moving words. But these few words meant more than all his speeches combined.\nRenal looked away from the stars back to his companion.\nAnd Changra gazed at him with eyes that glistened in the starlight.\nRenal smiled as he raised his arms wide.\nThe men hugged each other tightly, thumping each other's shoulders with pounding rhythms. They held each other long.\nAnd finally they released their hold and stood apart, wiping their sleeves quickly across their faces, not looking at the other. Above them the stars twinkled brightly above the turbulence of the crashing surf. Silence marked the passing of their great melancholy.\n\"We shall see each other again. Sooner than we think,\" Changra said sincerely, knowing it was a lie even as he uttered it.\nRenal smiled at the words, knowing without a doubt it would never be.\nAnd yet, it sounded so good.\n\"And what a grand day that will be.\" Renal said smiling.\nOn that twilight beach they walked together again, one last time, side by side in an easy familiar gait.\nRenal and Changra, lifelong friends, never saw each other again.\nFar, far away their separate journeys led. Wild, wonderful things awaited each; worlds of exquisite beauty, worlds of haunting, fantastic sites.\nBut despite their lasting separation, their friendship never ended. For in each, their heart and memory, they carried that friendship with them.\nAlways.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Who'd have thought that mom's obsession with Bram Stoker's Dracula would lead to naming her daughters Lucy and Mina. It doesn't matter. I just wanted you to know that I never have and never will regard you as satanic.\nSis, I thought I had this dang blurned thing figured out. Right now, I'm standing right back in front of my house. This time I hit on the morning before my Zartosian abduction.\nI don't know what in tarnation is going on. Besides, I got here and there was old plug ugly Beezle, or a bad ugly substitute, watching my earlier self take a bath. You know, since he is going on Lucy transport and I'm using this thing, well, he can no more see me than the earlier me can. I know, I know, he saw me back on Zartos. Well, back on Zartos my messing around had shut down part of it.\nYou know, if I figured this out right, I can shut down the invisibility part and have a little fun with old Beezle. I'll leave my Zartosian gadget on and you'll be able to listen in via letter.\n\"Beezle, Beez snoogie oogums, are you looking for me?\"\n\"Woman where are you? Our master requires you now.\"\n\"Hey spoiled honey! That is just too bad now. You give Lucy my regards. Oh, and baby bunting, be sure and thank him for this leather catsuit he gave me to wear back in his domain.\"\nOkay sis. I turned invisibility back on.

No matter what happens you'll hear from me honey.\nMina\n06-15-2005\nDear Sis:\nI'm back in the same dang spot and time frame!\nAll this time, you know, I'd sorta been lurking in the bushes. After all, even with invisibility, you can't take chances. The very moment I pop in I taste shrub in my mouth. It hadda be home. I was right, Dang!\nThe moment I got the shub out of my mouth, eyes, and annoyingly long blond hair, I saw Beezle spitting the neighbor's shrubs. Yeppydoodles, there he was mirroring my position. One thing, I know that you've called me a big mouth but my mouth isn't two feet across. Also, these blue eyes may sometimes flash red in photos but, day to day, these eyes don't look anything like burning coals. Awww, I don't care about Beez's cover boy looks anyhow. So, I better get over discussing him before I do care. Oh, that will happen, won't it? Oh Lucy, sis, I wish that you could see my face.\nYou know how I'm always getting you so riled up that you start cussing a blue streak? Well, I gotta get rid of Beez permanently. You think if I get him riled up enough he'll, maybe, start praying, invoking the name of the higher power and all? I bet old Lucy would get so mad he'd never let him near me again. What could get Beez that mad? I have been sweet talking him all along with no holy words spoke. What do you think will work? I know! Hang on!\n\"Beezle, honey lambkins! I'm over here! Hang on sweet thing! I'm coming over to you!\"\n\"Woman! You infuriate me as well as the master. Yes, you come here now! What our master saw in an alien porno star I'll never know!\"\n\"I suppose not Beezle. Could you stand there while I come a mite closer? Beez, you seem to have a speck of some shrub there, right there at the corner of that generous mouth. Let me take care of that for you.\"\n\"What are you doing woman?\"\n\"Smack!\"\n\"Oh Good God In Heaven! Save me from this infernal woman!\"\n(BANG)\nWell sis, apparently my plan worked. I think asking for help of someone other than Lucy was the big no-no. From the loudness of that sound I suspect that Beezle went from the proverbial frying pan right back into that proverbial fire.\nThis last time I think I just happened to twist the wrong knob. I should be seeing you soon sis. At least, no matter what, Beez'll be out of my hair. Bye.\nMina","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The familiar colors of the morning were not there yet and that made the old man uneasy. Things were no longer as certain as they once were, and a man who had accumulated the years Abner had never was comfortable when events regarded as consistently predictable proved otherwise.\nHis wife awoke and sat upright in the bed, her back too stiff against the headboard to appear entirely comfortable. She stared at the faded rose-strewn wallpaper, hesitating before she spoke as if trying to assess her thoughts. The withered flesh that framed the woman's quivering lips suggested that tears would not be very difficult to coax from her.\n\"A family should not be apart at a time like this. I know Ben and Mary Beth have their own families now, but I just can't seem to get past the disappointment of not having them here at home. Their place is here with us!\" The words poured from her like floodwater spilling over a dam too weak to contain it.\nAbner reached for his dentures. \"Let it rest, Flora. Their place is where they are just like our place is here. This is the way it ought to be.\"\n\"Nothing is the way it ought to be!\"\nThe husband nodded in agreement but could no longer look at his wife. When he spoke again it had come his turn to study the wallpaper.\n\"You ever consider what His purpose might be, Flora? Would the Almighty wager so many of his chips 'less he's got some sort of plan?\"\nThe woman looked hard at her husband. Abner rarely was very lucid so early in the morning, especially following the first painful minutes after he had inserted his store bought ivories. Although she never doubted the man's faith she had not been able once in the last forty years to rouse his God-fearing soul from bed for church on a Sunday morning.\n\"The Lord's plan isn't always for us to know,\" she offered, paraphrasing Scripture for want of a more original response that might indicate she had any idea of what he was talking about.\n\"Sometimes it is, Flora,\" he protested. \"Maybe every so often the Lord feels the need to do some house cleanin'. Just so things flow more natural in the world maybe He has to clean out the gunk to keep the machinery well oiled.\"\nLike most with only a nodding acquaintance of The Good Book, Abner's perception of God was almost childlike in its naive belief that the Lord was a cross father aiming thunderbolts at his wayward children.\n\"Those dentures must be pinching your gums clear up to your brain, Abner. The world isn't a clogged sink. You're talking just plain nonsense. But I guess I needed to hear a little nonsense to get my feet back on the earth.\"\n\"Nonsense, eh?\" the old man repeated, mulling over the term. \"Yeah, I 'spose that's what I'd've said a week ago. But after seein' what's in the papers and on the evenin' news I can't say I'm so sure there ain't some plan behind it all. If that seems like some powerful nonsense I'm talkin' 'bout then it's nonsense that maybe has itself a purpose.\"\nThe woman reached for the flowered box of Kleenex on her night stand and managed a smile that she hid behind the tissue as she pretended to wipe her nose.\n\"Hell and damnation, is that what you're preaching now?\" she asked. \"You're beginning to sound like that young Reverend Whitecastle preaching on his soapbox to our congregation about the coming of Armageddon. I should hope the good Lord is a bit more restrained than that toward His own flock.\"\n\"Reverend who?\"\n\"Try to talk religion to a man who usually finds God at the bottom of a bottle of corn whiskey,\" she mumbled. The woman pulled herself from under the covers. \"You think maybe I ought to call Ben and Mary Beth, just to check on little Rachel and the baby?\"\n\"Flora, the sun isn't even up yet. I doubt our children will be.\"\n\"Well, they should be here with us, Abner. You know they should be here with us.\"\nHe did not bother to disagree. Doing so would have been pointless. People this morning were where they wanted to be. This morning, among all other mornings, that much was certain.\nInside the old farm house Abner and Flora prepared themselves for the new day. There was really nothing else they could do. Outside the bedroom window the sun broke free from the eastern horizon. Even on this day the dawn was magnificent.\nIn the sky, barely visible as anything more than a pinprick from the couple's kitchen window, a speck of light appeared.\nExactly twenty-four thousand two hundred and fifteen miles from Earth the fiery comet raced toward their back yard.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I was in such a hurry to get to practice, I didn't notice anything else. That was a bad mistake.

Sitting directly in front of me was a bearded,\nfat man in a dark suit.\nHe sat silently, smoking a cigarette. He stared at me as if I was bug under a microscope. Two men, one to each side of him, stood at attention holding military assault rifles. I recognized him from the description that Papa gave me; it was the Reverend Jim Bob Biggs, self-styled demon hunter. I was in deep, deep shit.\nHe stood up, walked over, and reached out to slowly crush out the cigarette on my cheek. The pain! Be calm, concentrate, ignore the smell. Flesh is a servant, flesh is a tool, flesh does what it is told. I made no sound.\n\"I am a soldier in the service of the Lord.\"\n\"You're a killer,\" I said with contempt.\n\"Soldiers kill in a just cause,\" he said lighting up another cigarette. \"However, I have been less than satisfied with my campaign against your kind.\"\n\"You haven't killed enough of us yet?\" I snarled.\nIn response to my impudence, he again crushed out a cigarette on my face.\n\"For a soldier to be successful, he must have as much information about his enemy as possible. I've had your community under surveillance for some time, looking for a special opportunity; the opportunity to snatch a cub like you for, interrogation.\"\n\"You think because I am a kid I'm more likely to spill my guts.\"\n\"Exactly. This is the deal. You tell me what I want to know, and I will set you free. Lie to me, and you will die by slow torture,\" he said as he brought another cigarette towards my face.\n\"I'll talk! but you're not going to like it.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"There is a difference between telling the truth and telling you what you want to know. You think that we are a cult, that we worship the devil and practice human sacrifice.\"\n\"Isn't that how werewolves gain their power to change from men into wolves?\"\n\"No, we are born this way. Like most humans you have it reversed. We are not men who change into wolves; the lupine form is our natural state. Besides, I don't think we look a thing like a wolf, but more like very large greyhounds with long legs, large brains and opposable thumbs. And while we are quite agile on all fours, we are bipeds just like you.\"\n\"What nonsense is this,\" he snarled and started to burn me again.\n\"Reverend! You have to put all that occult crap out of your head,\" I said struggling against my bonds.\n\"Be still cub, my men have silver bullets in their rifles.\"\n\"God damn it man, it doesn't make any difference if the bullets are silver, copper, gold or lead. I am not something supernatural; I am flesh and blood. Any kind of bullet will kill me.\"\n\"Boys, go wait outside.\" The two men obediently left the room. \"See, I am a fair man. I could tell that my soldiers scared you so I have sent them out. Now there's only you and me. Talk to me.\"\n\"Listen,\" I said catching my breath and trying to hold my fear. \"It would help if you think of us as ship wreaked sailors.\"\n\"Fascinating,\" he said scratching his neck. \"You're saying that you came here in a ship from the old world?\"\n\"In a way, yes.\"\n\"What happened, did you ship go down in a storm?\"\n\"No, the hyperspace jump engines exploded.\"\n\"The... what?\"\n\"Hyperspace jump engines. Those are standard equipment on interstellar exploration vessels.\" The Reverend gave me a blank look. \"Space ships. I didn't lie when I said we came from the old world, I just didn't mean this one.\"\n\"You're telling me you are an alien from outer space?!\"\n\"I'm not an alien from outer space; I was born in Waco, Texas. However, my great, great grandfather was from the home world. The ship came down in the general area of New York city.\"\n\"I find that hard to believe. Why are there no newspaper accounts of such an occurrence happening? Something like that would be hard to miss.\"\n\"That's probably because the printing press had not been invented.\"\n\"That would have been around the time of the Civil War and there were plenty of printing presses around.\"\n\"No, the crash happened during the middle ages.\" The Reverend looked at me incredulously. \"We are a rather long lived race.\"\nThis is all bullshit! You just happen to be able to turn into human beings!\"\n\"Not just human but any type of life form. We are perfect mimics.\"\n\"So you're saying that every thing I think I know about werewolves is wrong?\"\n\"No, there's one thing you know about us that's true. If we bite a human, he or she, becomes one of us.\"\n\"I suppose you have a rational scientific explanation for that also,\" he said sarcastically.\n\"Of course I do. We were a highly advanced, technological people. The crew of our space ship were all members of an extended family group, but a species can only tolerate so much inbreeding before it gets into trouble. They devised a symbiotic virus that would stay in their system to pass on from one generation to another. When the virus entered the bloodstream of the selected aboriginal person, it would immediately begin to resequence their DNA along our lines. I'm speaking from experience here.\"\n\"Explain.\"\n\"I'm adopted. It was winter and the roads were icy. The car lost control, slid over an embankment, and my parents - my biological parents - were both killed. Papa dug me out of the wreckage and took me home with him. At least that is what Papa told me. I was too young to remember any of it.\"\n\"And you believed this story?\"\n\"Papa has his faults but he's not a liar.\"\n\"Oh Lord, an innocent human child has been recruited and corrupted by the powers of darkness! I'm almost sorry I have to kill you.\"\n\"You haven't believed a word I said.\"\n\"You can't help but believe all the lies you have been told. You were raised in the presence of evil. None of this is your fault, and I am a fair man. Boys come back in here!\" His two thugs promptly reentered the room. \"I promise you will die quickly. Shoot him, John\".\n\"I don't think so,\" one man replied. \"I am, however, going to ground his ass for a month for being so careless.\" The man smiled - dare I say - wolfishly at the Reverend.\n\"Papa, is that you?\".\n\"Don't be silly,\" he replied.\n\"John?\" the Reverend said, with fear in his voice.\n\"You should have paid more attention to my son, Reverend. He was being truthful when he told you that we are perfect mimics.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" said the Reverend.\n\"Your men were relieved of guard duty.\"\nPapa said, \"I hope you learned a lesson, son. I wanted to tell you before you ran out the house, that the Reverend was seen in our neighborhood. Even so, you should have spotted him following you. Carelessness can get you killed.\"\n\"Yes, Papa,\" I answered contritely.\n\"Kill them both, David,\" the Reverend screamed at the second man.\n\"You really should have listened to our son,\" answered the second man as he came over to untie me. \"And you really shouldn't have tortured him.\"\nI'll be damned, I thought. The second man is Mama. I had never seen her put on a male form before. She was good. She was also pissed.\n\"What a day,\" said Papa as he took off his clothes. \"All this and you missed baseball practice too.\"\n\"No big deal,\" I said.\n\"Considering how low your batting average is, I don't agree.\"\nThen he turned toward the Reverend and began to change.\n\"You see, Reverend,\" I said. \"We don't look anything like a wolf.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

But the list as it is written is actually closer to a description of the work of hard sf writer, Greg Bear, than it is to the Bible.\nI think there are two helpful categories to understand the work of Greg Bear: the first is through his animated exploration of theological ideas, and the second, is through the myth of the hero.\nThere was a time when theology was taboo in science fiction, editors steadfastly refusing to accept work which included metaphysical speculation. That has changed, but the theology that is presented in sf has tended to focus either on the person of Jesus (eg where did Jesus go when he ascended?) or on the institution of the Church itself - a fascinating but not necessarily edifying subject. Greg Bear is much more satisfying than that. He understands that theology - and good books - concerns the important issues of existence. It seems to my theologically-trained brain that his research is as exhaustive as is his research in biology and physics, the two \"hard sciences\" which pre-dominate in his books.\nBut it would not be true to say that Bear's books hold the reader because of their theology. Where Bear differs from many hard sf writers is in the believable complexity of his characters. Michael Perrin, for example, is drawn as a complex and sensitive teenage poet who discovers his power and maturity by discovering the real power of words.1\nJohn Clute and Peter Nicholls contend that the \"significance of GB's later 1980s novels lies in the fact that his human beings are more difficult to describe than his physics.\"2\nBear does what good novelists have done for hundreds of years: he creates interesting characters, places them in believable worlds, and sees what will happen when they are faced with change and conflict. Michael Perrin, for example, goes to visit the house of a friend who has died, and ends up in another world. The relationships between the humans and the others in this nearby invisible world matures him, and teaches him to deal with the toughness of life with honesty and courage.\nWhen he returns five years later, he, not surprisingly, finds it difficult to settle back in to \"normal\" life, and only finds his feet anew when the collapse of the world above threatens the safety of this world. Then he is revealed for what he really is: the hero who can save the situation by clear vision and determination.\nThis second theme of heroism is also apparent in Greg Bear's novels. Ordinary people, like Michael Perrin, find themselves confronted with injustice, are trained in the art of fighting for justice by a mentor whose place in the scheme of things straddles the good and the bad, and finally triumph in the final showdown.\nThis pattern of heroism is present in much \"popular\" sf. Perth author Hal Colebatch gives an interesting account of the heroes in Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Luke Skywalker in particular, is an ordinary teenager who, faced with the injustice of inequity in land distribution, learns the arcane arts of the \"Force\" from a mentor (Obi Wan) whose relationship to Darth Varder (the incarnation of evil) is never quite clear. Yet the fact that Obi Wan equips Luke enables him to conquer Darth Varder at the end. What is of major interest to Colebatch is the development of these heroes. They become noble, strong and virtuous through their exposure to a coherent belief system presented by a powerful mentor.3 He quotes an American commentator, Professor Thomas Howard, who despairs that his college students in the late 70s had no idea of classical heroism.\nI have sometimes given a class the following list of words: majesty, magnanimity, valor, courtesy, grace, chastity, virginity, nobility, splendour, ceremony they have never encountered them.4\nI hasten to add that Colebatch works closely with the staidly conservative Australian Institute for Public Policy, and is quite open about his conservative politics. There may be a strong dose of nostalgia potion in his longing for good old-fashioned values. His point, however, about heroism is pertinent: science fiction and fantasy are ideal vehicles to convey attractive pictures of heroism and the coherent belief structures behind them.\nWhere I disagree with Hal Colebatch is when he insists that coherent belief structures are necessarily politically conservative. Greg Bear's novels bear witness to a more open and socially progressive notion of humanity than Colebatch's interpretation of Skywalker and Frodo.\nFor example, in Eternity,5 the Way is a singularity built out from the asteroid Thistledown to enable travel through time. It has been closed for fear of alien invasion. Lanier, the Engineer, and others need to retain huge dollops of knowledge to open and maintain the way, so Bear explores the idea of multiple personality to meet this need. His characters, particularly the engineers who maintain the Way, have downloaded into their brains the minds of other scientists. However, these downloaded brains bring with them the personality of the dead person. Much of the trilogy concerns the delicate balance required by the Engineer to make sound judgements when his, or his resident minds, are under stress. And when an alien mind enters the Engineer as well, he is inexorably drawn into a positive, rather than negative relationship with this new entity.\nThe point of all this complexity, of course, is to insist that human personality is open, and our knowledge of it is so incomplete that it would be unwise to close off the possibility of other forms of being human. Colebatch would be intrigued but alarmed, for his conservative views are likely to favour the integrity of the individual.\nBy contrast, Bear's heroes are more complex than Luke Skywalker. They illustrate the corporate heroism of humanity, and suggest an optimism about the future. Human beings will continue to struggle with major themes of existence, and technology will both be an ally and also simultaneously open up new ways of being human.\nTheology indeed. But Greg Bear's books are good novels first.\n1. Greg Bear was President of the American Science Fiction Association in the eighties and early nineties. His books include\n2.John Clute and Peter Nicholls, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, 1993 ed., s.v. \"Greg Bear,\" 99-100.\n3.Hal Colebatch, Return of the Heroes: The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Contemporary Culture (Perth, Western Australia: Australian Institute for Public Policy, 1990), 103 pages.\n4.Colebatch, 1990, 52.\n5.I think! One of the frustrating things about writing this article has been the difficulty of checking facts. The books are never on the library shelves, testimony to their popularity.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

A void.\nIn an instant it changed.\nHe was standing in a valley, on either side of him a tree covered ridge rose to meet the bright blue sky. Directly above a few white puffy clouds floated, trailing dark shadows that slid across the curving hills as the fresh breeze pushed them along. A riotous, colorful array of wildflowers carpeted this pastoral scene between the giant emerald shoulders.\nCedric felt the wind caress his face as he breathed deeply his new surroundings. Honeysuckle was blooming unseen nearby as a sweet aroma filled his nostrils.\nIt was so beautiful, so peaceful. Like the Garden of Eden.\nLooking up one end of the vale, he began walking to a small stand of hardwoods. Singing came to his ears. Happy trills and chirps filled the air as dozens of birds began to fly around him. Cedric reached out his right hand, forefinger extended.\nA multi-colored tiny bird lighted on his finger perch, cocking its feathered head to one side for a better look. Green, almost iridescent feathers seemed to glisten off its back. He recognized it as a finch native to Australia. A little out of place here. But then, so was everything.\nCedric whistled briefly, trying to imitate the sounds around him. His newfound friend answered sweetly.\nLooking up, he realized that birds were now flying all around him, circling, as their merry songs filled the air. Little chickadees, red cardinals, finches of gold and finches of bright green. His heart filled with an appreciative joy.\nCedric slowly spread his arms apart as the little finch wobbled and tried to balance on the now moving perch. With a quick flapping of wings he was gone.\nClosing his eyes in silent concentration, Cedric rose effortlessly into the breeze.\nWilling it.\nAs the magical weightlessness filled his senses, he opened his eyes and leaned forward. The grass moved quickly under him as he glided low, just off of the ground. Up ahead, the trees were rapidly approaching. Pulling his head back, he rose quickly, just missing the topmost branches as a squirrel chattered in excitement somewhere unseen inside the mass of green leaves. A flock of birds followed him in a long undulating and ever flowing line, whistling their own comments on the joy of flight.\nIt was such a wonderful feeling, flying once again. The wind rushed into his face, blowing his hair rapidly as he wiggled his fingers against the force of the air, much as a child would do with his arms out the car window as it zoomed along.\nStraight up he flew, and then stopped suddenly in mid-air, frozen with arms wide apart. Laughing, he pitched forward with a sudden momentum as if he were riding some invisible runaway roller coaster. The ground rose rapidly. He bent his body backwards and flew up into a great arc. Twisting and diving, over and around, his acrobatics spoke of many hours in this thrilling pastime. Up and around, faster and faster, he laced the sky with his laughter and shouts of joy.\nFinally, out of breath, his heart pounding from the exertion of the exciting maneuvers, he flew steadily toward a nearby cloud. The wide azure sky stretched far, far off in every direction. It felt as though he were floating in the middle of everything, the ground below a distant patchwork carpet.\nHis attention was suddenly drawn to the distant line of the horizon. Something was growing. Something huge.\nAcross the wide expanse a change hastened toward him. The sheer magnitude of it froze him.\nAnd then it hit him; the sky was changing colors. Something quite unexpected. A chill of excitement ran up his back.\nAs he hung in mid-air, he waited. The size of it awed him. The entire sky was changing color, in just a matter of seconds. Inexorably it rushed by him. Not even a whisper of a breeze hearkened its passing. But in its passing, a pristine purple now covered all where the sky had once been blue. Even the clouds were a lighter shade of this all encompassing color. Below, the green of the trees and grass seemed to shimmer with a purple glazing.\nIt felt... different.\nCedric liked it. Closing his eyes, he concentrated, and then whispered a command. He opened his eyes again.\nThe entire sky now became a multitude of colors, more stunning than the greatest rainbow ever known. The deep colors spread apart and melted together with the colors of their neighbors. Shades of blues, yellows, greens, reds, mauves...the sky was every color. The sky was a rainbow.\nLaughing, Cedric flew faster and faster, rolling over onto his back as he gazed at this new creation. The wind whipped his hair as he effortlessly flew. Time again passed, how much he did not know. It didn't matter here.\nWell...\nHis body began to fall from the sky, but with a quick shake of his head he ejected the illicit thought. Closing his eyes, he let that wonderful feeling flow throughout his very being. Again he was floating on the wind.\nOpening his eyes, he looked longingly towards the west.\nLight flashed.\nSunlight glistened brightly from the far off rolling of ocean waves, its blue green color now seemingly a part of the sky as they melted together. His heart beat with a new excitement as he turned.\nThe landscape rolled quickly underneath. Even his feathered friends could not keep up with the speed he willed as he headed for the waters.\nThe trees underneath gave way to sandy dunes, and then to the sea. He stopped his forward momentum far out over the waters and lowered himself until he was just above the never-ending waves. He breathed deeply the salty smell and felt the cleanness of the foaming spray as it splashed and glistened upon his skin. And then he lowered into the warm embrace of the waters.\nHe heard them almost immediately.\nIt was a different chattering. Almost instantly he was surrounded by the rollicking gray forms of dolphins. Diving, he looked out through the clear pristine waters. Dozens and dozens of the playful creatures swam and frolicked within sight. One suddenly appeared from below, his soft snout nuzzling Cedric's cheek.\nAnd then Cedric felt his body move upward as some huge unseen force lifted him above the waters. He rolled backwards once he was above the waves and slid off of the slick rubbery surface that had unexpectedly appeared.\nThere were whales here!\nHe watched the huge back disappear back into the waves, the huge fluked tail disappearing last. He looked around for the whale's brethren. More backs appeared above the waves as the geysers from their released breath sprayed into the air. Rolling onto his back, Cedric floated on the rising and falling bosom of the ocean's waves. His ears were just below the surface of the water. To them came a haunting symphony\/chorus as the whales began to sing. Long, eerie sounds rose from the depths around him. But as he listened, a soothing feeling came over him. His body relaxed as he became one in this watery place.\nBut there was one thing else he wanted to do, before it was too late. Righting himself, he gazed around at the now seemingly empty ocean around him. He whispered a command and his wish was fulfilled.\nA lone whale swam slowly alongside him. Climbing onto the wide curve of its back, he found the strap in the usual place. Straddling the huge leviathan, he kicked for speed.\nAs the huge back of the whale started to slide under the bright green waters, Cedric held tightly to the strap and took a deep breath. The waters pulled at him, trying to unsaddle him. He felt the mighty power under him as the whale plowed through the water. Each movement spoke...\nAnd then the darkness returned.\nCedric clenched his eyes shut, trying to block out the inevitable.\n\"OK, pal. Time's up.\"\nCedric opened his eyes. The void was still there. He felt his hands begin to shake.\n\"Hey! I said your time's up. And I already checked your credit on the net, so I know you can't buy any more. So out!\"\nThe large burly attendant stood back as the suited figure of Cedric rose. Slowly, sadly, Cedric removed the oversized goggles and unplugged their connectors from the rubbery covering of the helmet's suit. His eyes gazed unfocused upon reality.\nJim shook his head as he noted that and the trembling hands still encased inside the rubbery membranes of the VR suit. He looked down at the digital display and noted the player's name and elapsed time: over eight hours in this one session!\n\"Cedric? Is that your name, pal? Nod if you can understand me, OK?\"\nCedric nodded.\nJim reached over to the suited shoulder.\n\"You think maybe I ought to call the resident shrink over here. We got a good one on duty right now and...\"\n\"No!\" Cedric shouted. And then he put his hand to his throat, gasping for breath as his entire body began to shake uncontrollably.\nJim took a couple of cautious steps away from the choking man. One never knew with these VR freaks, after all.\nCedric's green eyes finally began to focus onto the darkened interior of the large expansive room filled with hundred's of other people encased in the black rubbery suits that connected them to the nearby MPSC. They were each in their own world right now. And Cedric desperately wanted to return to his. He felt the fear begin to overpower him again.\n\"P..PIease...I can pay.\"\nJim again shook his head. \"You've had too much already, kid. You know the warnings...\"\nThe big man recoiled as Cedric grabbed his arm with more strength than his slight build indicated.\n\"I haven't had t...too much. These are good games anyway. No violence! No sex!\" Cedric's voice became shrill. \"You...ca...can't get too much of... Paradise!\"\nJim's eyes hardened as he pried the kid off his arm.\n\"I'm gonna tell you one last time, kid. Get outa that suit now!\" His voice suddenly grew low and serious. \"Or I'll add your name to the expulsion list. Indefinitely!\"\nCedric rose hesitantly, almost as if he were having to relearn how to walk again. Slowly he stumbled to the changing room, where several dozen people were already in various stages of dressing or undressing. But he wasn't aware of them, he didn't hear their laughter, their conversations. Cedric awkwardly removed the suit and left somberly.\nOut in the fuzzy lights of the city, with only a half moon shining its pale light through the wet and ghostly mist that enveloped him, Cedric turned up his collar against the damp cold of the late winter night. He looked up at the bright neon lights framed by the mist.\nParadise Games, it read.\nBut even as he tried to turn and leave, he knew he couldn't.\nOnly a cold, empty apartment awaited him. And tomorrow his stifling, monotonous job. And then the routine of the weeks to come would turn into months. Months into years. On and on and on.\nThe rest of Cedric's lonely life in this cold and impersonal world stretched before him in a flash of neon prophecy. His shoulders sagged under an invisible weight.\nHe found the darkened alley after he had meandered a short while in the bitter cold. Like a blind man he stumbled and fell into the array of strewn debris and trash.

The tent is breathing with the wind, swaying, sucking in and ballooning out like some kind of gigantic jellyfish. These new nylon dome jobs are built to be portable and lightweight, and that is exactly what they are in a good stiff breeze. I can hear the dog and he is restless - pawing around, snuffling and snorting and making other kinds of weird racket, and then it dawns on me, through the slowly ebbing sleep funk, that I don't have a dog. Great, beautiful... and the obvious question arises: If I don't have a dog, just what the hell is out there banging around in my camp. The brain zips into high gear and the ears kick into hyper-sensitive mode: auditory data, sensory processing, recall of past experience and the careful application of logic; the perfect union of intense listening and deep thought, a sane and pragmatic process to discern the exact nature of my nocturnal visitor... ah yes, the verdict (the envelope, please), and it seems that I have definitely decided (and the winner is) that I have a werewolf on my hands.\nHoly shit, what to do now, and I am instantly deeply sorry for my swaggering arrogant\ndaylight agnosticism, oh sweet Jesus. Think man, think! I'm fresh out of silver bullets\nand, then again, I don't even own a gun. In fact, the only silver for miles that I know of\nis the two delicate hoops in my left ear, and, although I am in pretty good shape, I just\ndo not feel entirely capable of ambushing a werewolf and successfully stabbing the\nsonofabitch to death with a goddamn earring. Maybe a hastily crafted blowgun or an\naccurately hurled fork, end over end, embedding itself between the eyes...yeah, right.\nRambo could probably deal with this nasty turn of events, but I am a mere mortal and an\nun-godly stench fills my nostrils, and I wonder lamely if it is\nme or the beast or both of us.\nThe survival panic is upon me and I slip, inch by agonizing inch, into my jeans and creep, inch by agonizing inch, through the tent flap and, inch by agonizing inch, out into the inky darkness. Not that I have any addled plans to do battle with a full-grown werewolf, or even a young one for that matter, but there is the overwhelming urge to be on my feet and mobile and clad from the waist down. I'm scared shitless to be out in the open, but the alternative of being mauled by a werewolf while laying on my back in my underwear inside a tent is sheer terror, and I hate to digress, but I must, if only to prop this thing up.\nEveryone, or at least everyone I know, has a weird tale about being in a life-threatening situation and, for no apparent reason at all, a strange casual off-beat notion will just pop up out of the blue and occupy the attention, and it's like, why the hell am I thinking about this when I'm about to die...maybe heavy jolts of fear short circuit a few integral axons of maybe the brain tries to divert itself in the face of certain death or maybe it is an ancient stalling technique to somehow occupy the modernized version of noggin while the repressed animal within us awakens and tries to figure a way out of this scrape. I don't know, but here's an example (I'm assuming perhaps you haven't followed). I'm 20 and I total my van - a screaming slam and roll job, and I'm flinging around like a rag doll in a tornado and am worried about the state of my socks. You see, it's a foregone conclusion that I'm going to the emergency room and Mom has always berated me about the importance of matching socks (clean underwear) and how embarrassed she'll be if she ever shows up at a hospital one of these days and finds her son laying on a stretcher with mis-matched socks (dirty underwear). And I'm pretty sure my socks don't match, the underwear is being soiled at this very moment, the van disintegrates around me and you get the picture.\nSo anyway, I'm outside the tent on my feet clad from the waist down in the dark being stalked by a homicidal werewolf, and my thoughts turn to urine; because I know that as soon as the beast grabs me I'm gonna piss hard right down the leg of my jeans, and it's gonna be a big press scene and the local yokel deputy is gonna immortalize me as a middle-aged white male who died of unknown violent trauma in a huge puddle of his own piss. (\"Never seen anything like it, must have been at least 5 or 6 quarts...\"). ...\"). (Is that proper punctuation? Looks kinda weird to me...\").\nMeanwhile the monster is snuffling, snorting, getting a good ripe snoutful of my scent, my spoor, and probably forming some tentative plans for the attack; licking his chops, sizing up the prey, gauging the possibilities of fight, struggle, resistance. (Well guess what, you hairy mother - first you're going to be blinded by a powerful blast of piss to the eyes, then you'll lose your footing in a slick patch of piss mud, and finally you'll find yourself gurgling and strangling on a steamy amber ammonia froth, a virtual deluge of piss). Whoa! Yikes! Egad! and I'm back... I have established a touch-and-go control over the bladder and I realize that I cannot stand this suspense any longer. Something must be done, even if it involves a sudden involuntary voiding. Waiting patiently in the dark to be ripped up by a hideous werewolf has become unbearably difficult for some reason. Action and damn the consequences and here we go; a super-human adrenaline rush lunge for the drop lamp, fumblefumbleclick and let there be light oh my God Mother Mary brace for the inevitable demonic body slam... and a squinty-eyed armadillo looks up in confusion at a quivering idiot with a wet spot in his jeans. And it's gonna be a big press scene and the local yokel deputy is gonna immortalize me as a middle-aged white male who died of a heart attack and, somehow, managed to drown an innocent armadillo in a huge puddle of his own piss. (\"Never seen anything like it, must have been at least 5 or 6 quarts...that pore little critter\"). Bullshit, that was a big evil armadillo.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I can't leave the Community. Dee's been too good to me - and you,\" she subtly reminded him.\nThe two acolytes clung to each other in the dimly-lit hallway of the third-floor women's dormitory. They were outside Sister Lisa's room at the head of the stairs across from a Counselor's room. They spoke in whispers so they wouldn't awaken the older woman or Lisa's room-mate.\nLisa appeared more desirable than ever to Bobby. Her long, dark hair flowed onto her nightdress like dark water from a decorative fountain. Her lovely, pale face was distorted with sympathy and conflict.\n\"Dee's the problem now, Lisa. He's going to self-destruct - and take all of us with him... You heard him at the last Gathering. He's become suicidal. He must have cancer, or something, and he doesn't want to leave all he's built behind for someone else to run.\"\n\"That's your theory. I think Dee was just rambling on like he often does... You swore to obey him. He needs you more than ever, now.\"\nBobby swore, anew, at this reminder. \"To hell with my oath. I'm not going down the tubes with Dee. Look, I've spent my whole life here; if I can see things clearly, you should be able to. You've only been here for a year.\" He was annoyed at Lisa's inability to forsee the oncoming catastrophe.\n\"I've been here long enough to learn to love Dee and everything he's created.\" Her calm blue eyes mirrored her mood. \"He turned my life around. I trust him. You should, too.\"\n\"I trust my perceptions, Lisa. History is replete with examples of cult leaders bringing Armageddon to their followers. All the signs are here, if you care to read them. I want to save us both from Dee's folly. Let's go before it's too late.\"\nLisa brushed his cheek with her fingers and smiled at his academic manner. Datajacks sometimes acquired a veneer of sophistication because they spent so much time on the Web handling the works of the better-educated. \"It's already too late for you, Bobby. You think too much and you have too little faith... Goodbye, and good luck.\" He released his hold on her and allowed her to reenter her room.\n(\"Damn!\") Bobby scowled, but wasted no time. He walked rapidly down the stairs and into the watchroom where Brother Michael was dozing. There, at the central control panel, he quietly disabled the front door alarm, then slipped out of the large house through the same door his parents had dragged him through as a toddler, twenty years ago. His years of loyal dedication crumbled away, and the remnants of his obedient faith were lifted from his troubled mind.\nHe moved down the street without looking back or shedding any tears.\nBrother Robert's parents had been a counterculture couple looking for enlightenment. They'd hoped to find it at Searchment House, the home of the cult founded by the man who called himself, simply, \"Dee.\" His cult was officially incorporated as \"Web Possibilities, Ltd.\" to evade the scrutiny of government and private cult-monitoring organizations. Dee discretely sought no publicity and dealt with such as occurred with a glib disclaimer. \"We're not a religion,\" he would say, \"We're just a paternalistic corporation.\"\nWeb Possibilities, Ltd. was in fact an excellent Web design and infosearch firm... It was also a datajacking gang... Under the cover of legitimate enterprise, Dee's cultists cracked private and government information systems, and secretly sold their data to clients who dared not attempt such risky, illegal activity, but paid generously for the product of it.\nBobby's knowledge of Dee's secrets kept him on his toes. It showed him clearly and uneasily what kind of outfit he had become a part of: a criminal conspiracy organized as a cult and masquerading as a legitimate business enterprise.\nBobby's restless parents had moved on to other enlightenments before they'd learned dangerous secrets, but had left their young burden to be \"temporarily\" cared for by Web Possibilities, Ltd. As the astute Dee knew they would, they never returned. Robert Osborn Crawley was reared within the cult community.\nIn time, Bobby Crawley became Dee's best, but ultimately the least-faithful, datajack. Bobby manifested his increasing sophistication to Dee, but none of his developing cynicism. He matured as a quietly-skeptical young man - a result that would have surprised casual students of cultist behavior. By the time Dee began hinting at group suicide, Brother Robert was already planning his escape.\n(\"I've got a lot to offer,\") Bobby silently reassured himself as he sat near the rear-door of a metro monorail car, dressed in his plain cult suit. He was fairly confident about his employment potential, but less-confident about escaping from Web Possibilities, Ltd.\nDee always avoided seeming a stern authoritarian. But his acolytes had already forcibly \"recovered\" one escapee. When the young man had been returned to the Community, he showed the none-too-subtle effects of a \"reorientation\" by the Master. He remained silent about his experience and never attempted escape again... His example was not lost on his fellow cultists.\nBobby had been unable to obtain street clothes from the locked storeroom. In his distinctive, drab suit and collarless shirt, he could easily be identified. He was determined to reach the downtown urban Combat Zone, where he would disappear from sight until he could market himself to another datajacking outfit that would protect him. He glanced nervously around him at the few late-night passengers in the car. None seemed very aware of him. Most of them were asleep, or trying with difficulty to stay awake.\nIt was a measure of his talent that Bobby had managed to steal some money from the Community. He'd accumulated enough begin his escape, he hoped. He could have stolen a creditcard, but he knew better than to use one of those. He might as well drip white paint behind him as leave a spending trail Dee's datajacks could retrieve.\nBobby guessed that Dee employed private investigators, and that these would be loosed upon him like hounds after a fox as soon as his escape was confirmed. He considered obtaining a weapon - pepper spray was a legal choice. But he was doubtful of his physical prowess against tough, trained operatives... In front of a computer monitor, he was skillful and quick. Among the virtual structures of information, he was confident and a little arrogant. But, in the world outside the Community, he was anxious and uncertain. He'd lived a sheltered life for too long.\n(\"I've got to learn some practical strategies, quickly,\") he advised himself in the academic language of his chosen profession.\nBrother Robert had been more than a datajack. He was an information organizer - Dee's best, by far. In an earlier age, he would have been a librarian or subject indexer. In this age of worldwide electronic information, his talents combined several traditional skills: computer programming, subject indexing\/searching, and information structuring techniques.\nHe would have liked to migrate to the coast and offer his skills to one of the companies organizing Web data. He particularly preferred Yo!, Inc. They employed people like him to organize their indexed Web sites for search and retrieval... But he also knew this was a place where Dee's PIs would surely seek him. Yo!, Inc. was a dream that died aborning.\nHe was beginning to consider offworld employment alternatives when his speculations were suddenly interrupted.\n\"You got a joint, man?... I really need one.\"\nBobby whirled to stare at the disheveled young man standing in the aisle by his seat. The guy looked like a professional vagrant, but otherwise seemed harmless. His proffered hand shook with a palsy born of past excesses.\n\"No... But I can tell you where to get one. They have a Web site,\" Bobby offered, confidently. He guessed this guy needed medgrass more than some of those who qualified for it.\nThe homeless drifter stared, bleary-eyed and heavy-lidded, at Bobby. Then, he withdrew his trembling hand and stumbled, wheezing, back toward his seat at the rear of the car.\n\"Shee-it... I need some real stuff, man.\"\n(\"So do I,\") thought Bobby. (\"I need a real life now.\") He turned back to the window and its passing parade of nightlighted streets. But he knew that datajacking was a real life. A dangerous one... One he would be stuck with for a long time.\nFrom the loading platform of the Combat Zone North metro station, Bobby saw a small crowd gathered around the entrance to a garish, neoned girlie bar. There was a guy lying on the sidewalk. A siren announced the imminent arrival of an ambulance aircar. Policemen were already at the scene questioning bystanders.\nDespite his fear that his escape might have been reported to the police, Bobby found himself drawn to the scene. He moved cautiously down the stairway to the street and over to the crowd.\nThis was the kind of street scene Bobby had only viewed on televideo. The sheltered life he'd led in Searchment House had insulated him from acts of criminal violence. He found himself fascinated by the crowd. He reached the fringe and asked a stranger about the victim who was sprawled in a pool of blood.\n\"I dunno, man. Some guy started a ruckus with someone and got stabbed. I heard 'em yellin'. Then a fight started.\"\nJust then, an older man in a spacer's uniform came running down the sidewalk and elbowed his way into the inner circle. Bobby noticed that he had the traditional four sleeve-stripes of a spacer Captain.\nThe spacer cursed at the sight of the victim on the sidewalk. A policeman began to question him: \"You know this guy, Captain?\" The spacer's reply could be heard by the suddenly-hushed crowd.\n\"He's one of my crewmen. I've been looking for him... We lift off tomorrow, and he comes down here and gets himself killed in a fight, the stupid...\"\n\"Who is he, and what's your ship? Let's see some ID, Captain.\" The policemen showed the shipmaster more respect than they were accustomed to showing citizens in the Combat Zone, an area where the official municipal attitude was \"Almost Anything Goes.\"\nThe Captain handed over his ID chipcard and added, \"I'm Harold Brickbender, Master of the dataship Terrinforma. Your victim was my Data Organizer, First Class, Sergei Novakov. He should have had his chipcard on him, separate from his wallet.\"\n\"We found his card, but his wallet was stolen by the guy that stabbed him... Looks like you need a new crewman now, Captain,\" the cop said as the medics from the ambulance pushed through the crowd with their gurney.\nA little thrill jolted Bobby, and he moved back into the shadows. (\"Data Organizer, First Class!\") He'd considered the possibility of joining the crew of a dataship, but he was a groundhog with no experience in spacing, and he figured the odds of a ship-job were remote... Now, though...\nCaptain Brickbender stepped out of the crowd. He stood on the curb to hail an autotaxi... (\"It's now or never.\") Bobby moved from the shadows toward the spacer, who was having trouble finding a cab. Autotaxis were scarce in the Combat Zone, where hailers were often drunk, doped, or robbed of their valuables. An autotaxi's sensors were skillfully programmed to detect reliable customers and to reject undesirables. This technology was a closely-held secret.\n\"Captain Brickbender?...\" Bobby asked in a timid voice.\nThe Captain glanced around at the black-suited cultist, casually at first, then with interest. \"Who're you?\" Brickbender asked, unsmiling, still annoyed at the needless loss of his crewman. \"You look like one of Dee's datajacks.\"\nBobby's heart sank at the spacer's savvy, but he was determined to keep his composure to impress the man. He cooly fudged his precarious situation. \"I've recently left Searchment House, sir. I'm looking for a new position as a data organizer... I see you need a new man.\"\n\"I don't need a data thief, son. I need someone who can manipulate legally-obtained information. That's my business: selling information above the counter, not below it.\"\n\"Then I'm your man, sir. I was a datajack - that's true - but I was Dee's best data organizer, too. If you access the Web Possibilities website, I can show you what I've done for the organization. Their Revised Subject Classification, Version 3, is mostly my work.\"\nThe spacer squinted at Bobby. \"If you were so good, why did you quit?\" he inquired, bluntly. \"I didn't know anyone could quit Dee's cult outfit.\"\nBobby lowered his eyes and strove for humble frankness. \"I escaped, sir. I didn't want to steal data, anymore. I want a job where I can feel clean after a day's work.\"\n\"Hmmmm...\" The Master of the Terrinforma pulled at his neatly-trimmed vandyke beard. \"Have you ever spaced before?\"\n\"No, sir. But I'm young and willing to learn. And there's one place I'm right at home: in front of a computer terminal. I've been learning that business since my parents gave me to Dee as a baby.\"\nCaptain Brickbender considered the possible consquences of stealing one of Dee's crack datajacks... But not for long. He turned to the street just in time to hail an autotaxi. Its computer approved his sensed characteristics, and it pulled over to the curb and opened its door. \"Welcome to Autotaxi,\" said a vox.\n\"Get in, son. I figure you don't have much time to stand around on the streets like this before Dee's guys grab you.\"\n\"Thanks, Cap'n,\" said Bobby, hoping to get just the right tone of obedience into his voice. He and the officer entered the cab, and it sped off toward the spaceport.\nAs the neon signs of the Combat Zone rushed by, Captain Brickbender gave Bobby some straight talk. His demeanor was that of a vessel's Master to a crewman. Bobby had no doubt that the officer would expect him to perform well in exchange for his rescue.\n\"I'll expect you to demonstrate your skills right away. This isn't a training cruise.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Bobby.\n\"And, boy, if you try to desert the Terrinforma with some of my data, you'll end up freeze-dried in orbit around a star.\"\nCaptain Brickbender stopped at a clothing mart and had Bobby fitted with a crewman's uniform. Then, they visited a dingy photographer's shop near the spaceport, where Bobby had a change of identity. He entered as Brother Robert - green-eyed, short-haired, clean-shaven datacultist - and left as Data Organizer, Third Class, Eldon Roath: brown-eyed, long-haired, and mustachioed... Staring into the lighted makeup mirror, Bobby satisfyingly beheld a stranger.\nGetting through spaceport security was a breeze. Captain Brickbender was well-known, and the guards didn't seem to be looking for anybody in particular, yet.\nBy the time the sun arose, setting the early morning sky ablaze, DO\/3d Roath was oriented and bunked in the Terrinforma, an aging tramp vessel. As he peered out a port at the sky, Bobby recalled the old rhyme: \"Red sky at morning - sailor take warning.\"\nWould Dee have his PIs checking dataships?... The truth was that because the Web was so huge and pervasive, there were many places where Brother Robert could seek employment. Even the resourceful Web Possibilities, Ltd. could only check a few of them in the hours before the Terrinforma hyperjumped for the far reaches of space.\nDataships were spaceships that downloaded selected information from Web sites and from free and pay-for-use infosystems into their large, database-optimal computers. They then transported this information into space, stopping at Terran colonies and alien worlds which hungered for the latest data and infotainment from the human home-world, but were too far from Earth to receive timely radiodata transmissions. There, the ships sold their data at a profit.\nUltrawave communications was still a dream, although many outfits were striving to devise a faster-than-light commsystem which could compete with hyperdrive courierships.\nTramps like the Terrinforma downloaded their data to customers on the smaller, more-remote colony and alien planets - worlds which couldn't afford to contract for datasupply from big corporations like Universal Data or DataStream... Bobby knew that it would be some time before he returned to Earth and discovered if Dee had put out an intercept-and-recover contract on him - if he returned, at all.\n\"Well, crewman, you haven't vomited on my deck, so I guess I can put you in front of a terminal without fear you'll foul the keyboard and microphone.\" Captain Brickbender gave Bobby a little smile as a reward for his constitutional stability.\nDO\/3d Roath had been given a quick course in spacemanship before the Terrinforma leaped into space. After the short shakedown-period of freefall - during which Bobby fought to keep down his breakfast as he learned to maneuver himself without fracturing his bones against bulkheads and decks - the ship spun-up an artificial gravity which increased from the core outward. Since the dataterminals were near the ship's database computer in the forward core, Bobby had to get used to working in a lower gravity which required him to be belted to his terminal seat.\nBrickbender introduced Bobby to his new supervisor: Data Organizer, First Class, Eleanor Schroeder - newly promoted to fill the vacancy created in the Combat Zone of Terminal City, the data center of the Terran Alliance. Then, the Captain retired to the ship's bridge, and Bobby rarely saw him afterwards.\n\"The Captain thinks you may be of some use to us, Roath... I'll determine that for myself, now and later. If you measure up, we'll get along okay. If not ...well... you'll have plenty to learn.\"\nSchroeder reminded Bobby of an old-fashioned librarian, the kind who tolerates no foolishness in her reading room.\n\"Yes, ma'm,\" he replied, obediently. He was determined to accept this formidable woman's supervision the same way he had obeyed Dee's lieutenants at Web Possibilities, Ltd... Schroeder was a plain woman in her forties, an age that alone showed how tough she was. Spacers of that age were experienced and committed to their profession. They'd survived the hazards and boredom of service in the far reaches of the galaxy. Schroeder's prematurely-graying hair was unfashionably short - a warning to those who might mistake her for a fragile fem.\n\"Here's a list of subjects. Don't look at it yet.\" She handed him a folded sheet of paper. \"You'll find all the Web resources you can on these subjects. You'll rank them in order of relevance... I'll measure your retrieval time, your recall ratio, and the general worth of your data-ranking.\"\n\"Recall ratio?\" Bobby inquired.\n\"I have a file of all the relevant resources I've found for those subjects on your list. Your recall ratio is the percentage of those you retrieve. The higher your R\/R is, the better you've performed, other factors being equal... Any questions before you begin?\"\n\"How much of the Web will I be searching, ma'm?... You can't have but a small fraction of it uploaded into your ship's computer.\" He wondered if she would take offense at this factual remark.\nInstead, she smiled at him for the first time.\n\"Crewmember, we have enough of the Web here to keep you plenty busy as we weave our way through the stars. There's a lot of organization to be completed before we start presenting our product to our customers.\"\n\"Yes, ma'm.\"\n\"You see that Latin motto up there on the bulkhead above the data-terminals? It tells you what we've got here: 'RETICULUM IN LAGONAE' - 'The Web in a Bottle.'\"\nShe stabbed a timer's button on her supervisory terminal.\n\"Now fetch, Roath.\"\nWhen Bobby finished his task, his supervisor measured his ranked list of relevant Web sites on her monitor... His recall ratio was 107%.\n\"Not bad. You found some data I didn't, and your time was fairly good,\" Schroeder sniffed... In fact, Bobby's scores were the best ever achieved on that particular test - better than the DO\/1st had accomplished, herself... The Captain hadn't told his DO supervisor that Bobby was the datastar of the infamous Web Possibilities, Ltd. He'd represented his stolen cultist as merely a qualified datanerd.\nBut DO\/1st Schroeder had an ace-in-the-hole she would use to overcome her shock and her envy of the new crewmember's superior dataskills.\n\"Get aquainted with the other datadope, Roath. I've got to report to the Captain.\" She left to display Bobby's test results on Brickbender's readyroom monitor - together with something she'd retrieved even before the new crewman began taking his qualification test.\nBobby grinned at her use of shipboard slang. He'd known that radar operators were known among themselves as \"scopedopes.\" He looked over at the other datadope on this shift. The attractive, dark-skinned young woman smiled shyly at him. She seemed to be an AfroAsian. She tried to put him at ease after his encounter with their starchy supervisor, as if to say, \"I'm not like her.\"\n\"We call her 'Herr Schroeder.' But she's okay so long as you don't push the wrong buttons... She's been waiting for the old DO\/1st to get fired so she could move up to his position. She figured Novakov would drink himself off the ship, though - not get killed.\"\nThen, she introduced herself. \"I'm Ranavalona. Call me Ranny.\" Her uniform bore the rankmarks of a DO\/3d.\n\"Bob - uh, Eldon Roath.\" To cover his slip of the tongue, He added, quickly, \"You're Malagache, I'm guessing.\"\n\"Oui,\" she replied. \"Is it Bob, or Eldon?\"\n\"Call me Bobby... \"Will Herr Schroeder worry that I'm after her new position?\"\n\"She worries about everything. She's a classic Library Lady - in a bottle... Don't ever make the mistake of correcting her, though, or she'll roar at you like a cranky old lioness.\"\n\"Ja wohl, mein Freund... Danke.\"\n\"Bitte,\" she replied, sweetly.\n\"Captain, I found something about our new crewmember you should see.\" Without waiting for the Master's reply, DO\/1st Schroeder turned his desktop monitor around and requested display of a file she'd stored. Then, she half-rotated the screen back, so he could view the data.\n\"After you told me about our new man - but before we hyperjumped - I did a radioWebsearch for jobseekers with data-organizing skills, and I found this unusual entry.\" Brickbender scanned the display. \"Note the resemblance in the ID photo,\" she added.\n\"Hmmmm.\" The Captain frowned. (\"This damn woman is pushing things, again.\") An inability to control DO\/2d Schroeder's impulses had contributed to DO\/1st Novakov's alcoholic excesses. The man had told him this on several occasions... Nonetheless, Schroeder had turned up a disturbing datanotice. Web Possibilities, Ltd. had acted to recover their missing datastar faster than he imagined they would.\nSchroeder continued, \"This notice has been posted on several different sites. It seems that WebPoss's datastar has flown the coop and ended up in our vessel. His real name is Robert Osborn Crawley - Brother Robert,\" she emphasized. \"You know what a cult WebPoss is.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Brickbender, calmly. His seeming unconcern annoyed the new DO\/1st. She continued, gratuitously. \"That's why he aced our retrieval test. The guy's been in this business since he came to WebPoss's kindergarten. My guess is that Dee, the cult-honcho there, either wants 'Eldon Roath' back soon - or out of the picture.\"\n\"Thanks, Eleanor.\" The Captain rotated his monitor back to face him. But Schroeder was not to be put off that easily.\n\"What're we going to do about him?\"\n\"We're going to keep quiet about it and make full use of DO Roath's skills while we have him.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"Thanks Eleanor. I'll take it from here...

The ship takes him to the space station Arcade where he is to be auctioned as a slave. Prior to the auction he is placed in a cell with a dataterminal and an android for company.\nThe only sound in the closed room, aside from the soft hiss of the ventilator grille, was the sound of clicking keys. Bobby was typing an email letter to his former girlfriend and fellow data organizer, Ranavalona... Of course, he didn't have an email address for her, or even know where she was. But he had decided to try a long shot: he'd post a message for her on the public bulletin board that was accessible to any dataship that stopped at, or passed, Arcade. He would tag the message for her ship.\n\"Capt. Morganski told me you were being returned to the good old Terrinforma. So if Capt. Brickbender checks Arcade's public BBS, he'll find this letter and give it to you,\" he typed. \"I sure miss you. I hope everything's OK with you now.\"\nHe reread what he'd typed, then added. \"That's about it, Ranny. I'm locked up in a room with a brain-dead android, waiting to be sold at a slave auction...\"\n\"I am not brain dead, sir. I have merely suspended my processes to await proper activation protocol.\"\nBobby jumped from his chair and whirled to face the voice that had spoken behind him. The android was still lying on its back. He moved over to the bunk, a little fearful despite the respectful tone of voice he'd heard.\n\"You have activated me, sir.\" The android's dark eyes moved to fix his fellow prisoner. Then, suddenly, he sat up, effortlessly. Bobby jumped back.\n\"How did you know what I was typing?\"\n\"I read the electromagnetic signals from your terminal, sir. They are in a common communications code called 'ASCII.'\"\nBobby gaped at the 'droid as he considered this remarkable ability. \"Can you transmit, too?\"\n\"Easily to devices equipped with a RASTIN - a RAdiodata STandard INterface - possibly to others not so equipped... This terminal is in the latter category. The Arcade Management is most cautious.\"\n\"I guess you weren't designed to dig ditches, then.\"\n\"No, sir. I am a Paramount Datadroid, First Class... My name is Amanuensis. You may call me Manny. It is similar to your friend's nickname, Ranny - but different.\"\n\"What in my letter specifically activated you, Manny.\"\nBobby pulled his chair over and sat facing the large android. He no longer thought of Amanuensis as \"it\".\n\"In your letter, you indicated that you had worked for both Web Possibilities Ltd. on Earth and 'the alien intelligence operation' on Rubicon Four. I was constructed by those selfsame aliens, the Rulatuvani. My basic instructions require me to communicate with and assist anyone who is an operative of the Rulatuvani.\"\nThis was the first time Bobby had heard the name of Redrock's aliens.\n\"That's me, alright,\" boasted Bobby for the first time. \"So you and I are a team, now... How do you come to be here?\"\n\"I was abducted by pirates from my master's yacht and sold to Kivo Artish. Mr. Artish intends reselling me to the highest bidder... I am quite valuable,\" he added, matter-of-factly.\n(\"I'll say... Your former master must be rolling in dough to afford a 'droid like you.\")\n\"Welcome to the club... But I'd rather not wait for the auction. If we can escape from this room, maybe we can sneak onboard a stopover ship - although I confess I'd like to see something of Arcade, first. I guess that's just a pipedream, though.\"\nAmanuensis arose from his bunk and loomed over Bobby. \"It may be possible, sir. I can open the door and we can go to the designated agent of the Rulatuvani on Arcade. He, or she, will undoubtedly offer us sanctuary... However, I do not know name of this person.\"\n\"Well, now's the time to find out how vulnerable the station's central computer is,\" said Bobby. He pulled his chair back to the terminal.\nAmanuensis stood behind him to watch. \"May I monitor you, sir?... My datajacking skills are rudimentary - despite my having many natural datahandling abilities.\"\n\"Sure,\" assented Bobby. \"This is your chance to watch a datamaster in operation.\" He knew his jocular boast would be accepted by the android as factual. But he had to prove it.\n\"You realize of course that Kivo Artish is monitoring this terminal?\" Amanuensis reminded the datamaster.\n\"No problem Manny, I'll erase all the log entries of my activity... Here's Lesson One: the first step is to take is the simplest one.\"\nHe paged beyond the display of the Code to the Main Menu, chose the Search function and typed \"rulatuvani\" in the dialog box. Another dialog box was superimposed on the screen. It requested a password. \"See how simple that was?... Now we need a password.\"\n\"Try 'tuvanirula'.\" Bobby did, and a page appeared. It was the public homepage of an Arcade businessman. The word \"Rulatuvani\" did not appear anywhere in the site's text to identify him as their agent.\n\"Tuvanirula?...\" Bobby frowned. \"Manny, that's just an anagram of 'Rulatuvani'. It's a guessable password. It offers almost no data security.\"\n\"Did you guess it, sir?\"\n\"No, but I'd have eventually tried it... Anyway, it got us what we need. It seems your agent is 'Jerash Norin,' a tailor whose registered shop is located in Section 8 of the Concourse.\" Bobby contemplated the man in the passport-type photograph. Jerash Norin was an elderly, bald man with swatches of unruly white hair around his ears and old-fashioned gold-rimmed spectacles.\n\"We should leave now, sir, and go to Jerash Norin's shop.\"\n\"How'll we avoid Kivo Artish's guards?\"\n\"I will neutralize the guards, sir.\"\nThe multitalented android unlocked the door by putting his large hand to the lockplate, transmitting signals, reading the lock circuit's response, then sending more signals... It clicked open. They were free - so to speak - Bobby and his new big brother.\n\"What else do you have in those hands of yours, Manny?\"\n\"All will be revealed in good time, sir.\"\n\"You don't have to call me 'sir,' you know.\"\n\"I am afraid I must, sir. It is in my operating system.\"\nIt was Arcade's third, \"midnight\" work-period. Artish's lone guard was watching a pornovideo in the guardroom at the entrance to the slaver's suite of \"offices\". To Bobby's surprise, Amanuensis boldly entered the room, seized the guard in a vicelike grip which prevented him from crying out, and put a finger to his temple. He held the struggling man until he lost consciousness. \"We may proceed now, sir.\"\n\"What've you got in that finger, Manny?\" The android's casual answer: \"A hypodermic injector, sir. I injected a dose of hyperpentobarbital. The guard will recover after a deep sleep.\"\n(\"Boy! Is this my lucky day, or what?!... I wonder if he has a radgun in his thumb?\") In fact, he did. In the other thumb, he had an electrostunner. Amanuensis was well-equipped - for a datadroid.\nThey set off into the Maze. Amanuensis led the way through the complex of corridors. \"I recall the way, sir,\" he assured Bobby.\nSoon, without meeting anybody, they exited a numbered door and found themselves in the Concourse. They slipped into the late-night crowd of shoppers and revelers. The uniformed spacers wistfully reminded Bobby of the Terrinforma. Some passersby stared at Amanuensis, and one drunk yelled out, \"Hey, Frankenstein!\"\nThe android's visibility was a disadvantage, here. But Bobby knew that no ordinary troublemaker would likely bother him while Manny walked beside him.\n\"Uh oh! The cops!\" Two burly members of Arcade's Security Garda appeared, ahead. They advanced toward the escapees in a leisurely fashion, glancing about them in the traditional way of policemen on a routine patrol. \"I can handle them, sir,\" said Amanuensis.\n\"No! We don't want any public trouble here in the Concourse!\" Bobby looked around, desperately seeking a place into which they might bolt... There. An antique shop was still open. The sign on its display window proclaimed, in old-fashioned gilt paint,\nRARE AND ANTIQUE WEB DATA\nM. Kandu, Proprietor\nBobby and Manny ducked into Kandu's. It was empty of customers. A large potted palm filled a corner. Old posters advertising early Web sites covered the walls. Plastiglass display cases contained labeled datacards and illustrative photographs of old Web pages.\nThe two operatives pretended to examine the displays as the two Security policemen strolled by in the Concourse, outside.\n\"Wow!... Look at this stuff, Manny! He's got some great Web 'tiques.\" Bobby inched his way along the display case. \"Here're some of the pioneer SFF&H ezines.\"\n\"SFF&H?\" queried Amanuensis... \"Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror,\" supplied Bobby. The android added this acronym to his huge database of useful knowledge, then he swiftly began to catalog the displayed datacards; the information might be useful, later. It was his way. \"This is indeed a treasure trove of Web 'tiques, sir.\"\nFrom behind a beaded curtain, the shop's proprietor watched his customers and listened closely to their talk. It was his way. His brow furrowed at hearing the slang word, \"'tiques.\" (\"Today's young people are so careless with language,\") he bemoaned.\nKandu's workroom dataterminal chimed softly. He left the curtain to check the new display.\n\"Look. He's got a complete edition of Ibn Qirtaiba, one of the classic SFF&H zines. I could never afford to buy the datacard, though. He wants an arm and a leg for it.\"\n\"Amputation is not so disadvantageous as you may believe, sir. The prosthetic state-of-the-art is quite advanced,\" replied the android.\n\"Manny, I didn't mean...\"\n\"Welcome to the House of Kandu!\" boomed the voice of a Turk.\nA bearded man thrust aside the curtain's beads, which clacked for some time after he passed through them. He was dressed as an Effendi - or maybe even a Pasha - complete with a long-tasseled red fez.\n\"Purchases can always be negotiated at Kandu's, gentlemen... But perhaps you'd first prefer to conceal yourself in my workroom.\" He rolled his eyes toward the Concourse in an unmistakable gesture.\nAmanuensis straightened, seemingly for action. \"No, Manny,\" cautioned Bobby, who grabbed one thick arm of the android.\n\"You see, your likenesses have just appeared on all the public and shop dataterminals. It seems you two are escaped slaves. The Garda is now seeking you.\" He raised his thick eyebrows.\n\"You've got a point, Mister Kandu,\" agreed Bobby. He and Amanuensis hurried around the display counters and through the beaded curtain. They stood in the dimly-lighted workroom, surveying a collection of dusty packing boxes. Two doors to other compartments faced them.\n\"Just call me Kandu... And please raise your hands.\"\nThey turned to find their rescuer pointing a radpistol at them.\n\"Kivo Artish's loss is my gain,\" smiled the antique dealer.\n\"Well, then. Here's my proposition: I'll sell you two to the person or organization of your choice if you cooperate with me and allow me my profit... Given your apparent worth, the profit from your sale should be quite generous.\"\nBobby and Amanuensis sat on an old leather couch. Kandu kept them covered with his pistol as he addressed them in a soothing voice.\n\"It's better than being sold by Artish to the highest bidder - who could be some neurotic noble or cruel planetary dictator. Under the circumstances, giving you your freedom is quite out of the question. If I hadn't rescued you from the Garda, you'd be back in the Maze facing an angry slaver... This is Arcade. There's nowhere to run.\"\n\"Do you really believe you can get away with stealing two of Kivo Artish's slaves and selling them, yourself?\"\nKandu smiled, indulgently. \"You underestimate me, Robert Crawley. I'm not the simple shopkeeper you believe me to be. I have very good connections. I deal in more than Web - 'tiques - as you call them.\"\nBobby was unconvinced... Kivo Artish was a registered businessman. He had the protection of the Arcade Management. The Code of Conduct probably prohibited this sort of commercial piracy aboard the station. Kandu could end up on the outside of Arcade's hull for doing this.\n\"What do you want us to do?\" he probed.\nKandu beamed broadly, and lowered his pistol.\n\"First, you datajack into the station's central computer and delete Artish's records of your sale to him - including the backup file, of course... Artish is such a technology-trusting fellow. He creates as little paperwork as possible, so he probably has no printed records of you two.\" He paused. \"Eh?...\"\n\"Okay. I can do that. The station's computer uses the old NUNIX operating system. It's supposed to be a high-security system, but it has some holes known only to professional datajacks - like I was.\"\n\"And will continue to be, I judge. I can tell: it's in your blood, Brother Robert,\" declared Kandu, emphatically.\n\"You know about my time at WebPoss, then?\"\n\"I know a little about a lot of things. But, yes, your reputation has preceded you, Brother Robert.\"\n\"Call me 'Bobby,' Kandu. But call my friend 'Amanuensis,' or he'll break your neck.\"\nKandu laughed. \"He's yours to command, Bobby.\" He raised his pistol. \"But just so you understand the realities of our situation: I know just where to aim to disable an android, and I'm a crack shot. In my youth, I was a Janissary in the Sultan's elite personal guard on New Turkiya... Fortunately, I was not chosen for his harem guard... Now, what's your decision?\"\nBobby considered Kandu's offer. He asked Amanuensis, \"What do you think, Manny?\"\n\"Sir, I think Kandu's scheme is fraught with danger.\"\nKandu frowned at this analysis. \"Just what I'd expect a machine to say... All I ask is that you function on my behalf. And in return, I'll find you two a good master. I won't confine you here, provided you exercise care to avoid being caught by the Garda.\"\n\"Agreed,\" declared Bobby. \"Right, Manny?\"\n\"As you say, sir.\"\n\"Good... Good,\" summed-up Kandu. He stuffed the pistol into the belt which confined his ample belly.\n\"Please begin your datajacking as soon as possible, Bobby. Use a public terminal so your work can't be traced back to my shop. You'd better wait until the Concourse is crowded with day-shift arrivals. I'll disguise you so you won't be recognized. Okay?... You can sleep here on that couch. I assume your companion needs no sleep. Of course he must stay in this room. He's too conspicuous.\"\n\"Okay. Manny, go stand in a corner,\" said Bobby in a humorous reply to Kandu's fiat. The android arose and walked to a corner of the workroom and stood silently with his back to them.\n\"I was just joking, Manny. You can turn around and face us.\"\n\"As you wish, sir.\"\n\"Just like a machine,\" scoffed Kandu, who pushed through the beaded curtain to close his shop for the night.\nBobby whispered toward Amanuensis, knowing he'd hear every word. \"Stay alert, Manny. I'll go to Norin and make the arrangements for our escape. Then we'll deal with this damn 'tique dealer - Janissary, or not.\"\n\"By your command, sir.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The benevolent Emperor ruled for one thousand years but a great ache in his heart ended his long life. Several provinces used the poor Emperor's death to start the Imperial Schism that caused many provinces to break away. The Loyalist provinces held up for 50 years after the good Emperor's death. The Chaos spawned by the wars between the rebel states corroded the Empire until anarchy prevailed. The years that followed were dark but there was constant hope that a protector would spring forth and bring hope to those who were oppressed and terrorized by the those who would take advantage of the weak.\n- Children Stories of Eleazar the Wise\n\"The armory of the flagship Dread Tsion was pilfered at five hundred hours local time. An armored combat unit, long range strategic explosive ammunition, field spectrum emulator, and a class 2 heavy plasma ejector were taken. More importantly the General's personal battle suit has been taken.\n- Jim this is a weird one. I personally don't want to be the one to be the one to report this but it looks as if I'm the one that's going to have to.\"\n- excerpt from second purser's log of the\nOld Imperial Fleet Ship Tsion\nI fell. I looked up at heaven for my rescuers but they were nowhere in sight. I expected that, but I also expected my enemy to be right on top of me. They weren't. I looked down but the wind blew my old face back so it was hard for me to see. I squinted and saw the ground thousands of feet below slowly rushing up at me. I contemplated my decision in jumping off the cliff. It was either this, which I thought I might survive, or sure death at the hands of my enemies. My instinct was to grab the cliff wall beside me but my mind overrode my emotions. I had that problem once before and it had almost been the end of me. This suit of armor I wore was supposed to have the ability stop great falls, like this, though I had never tested it. I would make it. I tried to enjoy the sensation of falling. My heart felt as if it wanted to jump out of my throat. My chest welled with excitement. I wondered where my victims were as I looked up to see a fist connect with my head.\nThe wind that blew the light azure clouds washed my face as I awoke. Around me was gnarled wreckage. I remembered...a metal wing and... a gauntlet. They had caught me. Trails of smoke danced around each other as they rose into the air. What was left of my ACM unit was next to me. The giant armored craft lay there with it's innards exposed, a wound caused by enemy plasma salvoes. This sight brought me to reality. As I tried to get up my head rung loud with pain.\n\"What was I thinking,\" I thought. \"I should have worn my helmet,\" I said as I rubbed where the enemy guard had hit me.\n\"Shut up scum!\"\nI looked around and saw the three winged figures standing over me. Their suits of armor were a design that I had never seen before. Their dirty gray chest plates shone still. The only color to contrast with their gray and black suits was their identical red hair. It gave their gargoyle-like suits an especially wicked look.\n\"Did you really expect to get away?\", a guard said indignantly.\n\"We should kill you,\" another said.\n\"An assassin deserves the worst kind of death,\" the last one grinned, \"A slow death!\"\nFrom what I could see I was in the base I had destroyed. The smoke swirled slowly around the compound before it dissipated into the pink sky. I did not wait there long though. Their troops were in a hurry. My guards took me to a shallow pit, miles in diameter. I had seen this from orbit. I would have had it bombed, but it looked as if it were just a landing pad of sorts, non-essential.\nThe sky was light red and dotted with azure clouds. It was warm. I saw two whale-like space cruisers move slowly over the pad. Their gritty tan hue brought out the dark green color of their identification marks. They paused for a few long seconds and then disappeared in a blast of light as bright as the sun. The bubble of light seemed to slowly shrink. I looked at the guards.\n\"So you're going to incinerate me here?\" I said patiently trying to hide my fear.\n\"Fool! That's a teleportation pad. Didn't Patzcu tell you you're going to die a long, hard death?\", he chuckled.\n\"You're going to a hell-world!\", another said as they all started laughing at me. \"There is no escape from Hades! We will even give you something to protect yourself with.\"\nAt least they weren't going to kill me. They didn't even know who I was. This type of imprisonment is something I had never heard about. I wondered what I had got myself into. I wondered how I was going to get out of it.\n\"You all seem like you're in a hurry to get out of here.\" I said. That comment made one of the guards angry enough to approach me.\n\"After you raided us you led the Great Terror here! There's no way we can defend against his force.\" He glanced at Patzcu and begged, \"Let me kill him now, please!\"\n\"Let him die at the hands of the beasts of Budacon III. There he will fear every shadow and noise, because they all carry death.\" Patzcu said.\n\"There no one can save you. No one knows the name of this world you are to banished to, so how could they ever find you?\" said one.\nPatzcu interjected, \"That's assuming anyone wants to find you, a foolish terrorist\"\nHades, Budacon, a planet that is a living hell, I thought. A nervous feeling in my belly told me that I might be in real trouble. They gestured for me to walk onto the pad.\n\"Just keep on walking,\" one of the three told me.\nI thought that if there was any time to escape it would be now, but I was unarmed and too far away for hand to hand combat. I looked back then and saw them placing my weapons behind me. The quiet guard wielded his plasma weapon as he got into a crouched position and escorted me with the cross hairs of his gun down the pad. I tried to look back again and the world turned black.\nThere was a feeling of weightlessness. It wasn't like the feeling of falling. I felt... incorporeal. I lost my sense of hearing too, as if a blanket was thrown over me. The pit in my stomach dropped to the ground.\n\"Bastards!\" I yelled as I remembered those who died quickly were the lucky ones. I did not hear my voice.\nAnd then I saw the blue night sky blessed by a billion stars. A blue haze drifted from the sky and the stars down to the horizon all around me. I heard the distant echo of my voice.\nIt seemed to be late-evening but as my eyes adjusted I saw that it wasn't that dark, maybe just beyond twilight. I backtracked and found my weapons. They left me my sword and a projectile hand gun. No food. No water. No shelter. Already I could feel the cold atmosphere of this world. My suit, which they generously let me keep on, was capable of keeping me warm.\nThe landscape was indigo. There were no moons but the sky was lit bright by the stars. The pit looked like a dark pool. I walked away from it. In the distance the land become hilly and what seemed to be forests patched what I could see. Perhaps dead trees. Dark shadows passed the hills and cautioned me but I realized that they were merely clouds in the distance.\nI sat down. My head was still hurting from the fall. I tried to move abruptly but light-headedness overcame me. I moved away from the pad area. I rested then on the bare ground.\nI rested there for I don't know how long. I dreamt well that night. I dreamt of the Emperor and the days of his rule. In the dream we were in a comfortable room. There were tapestries of woven silk metal on the walls with heraldic avians guarding this sanctuary of past times. The Emperor's stone throne was etched with the dead languages of the past, the intricate lines were like trails of fine smoke. The throne was carved from gray and black stone, smoothed like glass. The Emperor put his arm out and opened his palm as if to give something to me. I was full of wonder at this and moved forward to collect what was in his hand. I never reached him though. As I approached a white fire engulfed us both. I lost the Emperor in the flames. I felt the fire only in my chest, in my heart.\nI woke up suddenly and my dream ceased. I saw a bubble of white light growing dim as it expanded into the stars. Its beauty startled me. The landscape was briefly lit. The teleportation blast revealed a bright gray landscape that slowly turned brown and the light faded into the night sky. Someone else had been sent. I walked onto the pad and wondered what kind of desperado would be joining me.\n\"Hey out there!\" I yelled.\n\"Don't kill me!\" the stranger yelled back.\nThese \"hell-worlds\" held an evil reputation. I wondered what the life expectancy was. I wondered what dangers awaited me.\n\"Don't worry, I'm a good guy!\" I said with a smile that he probably couldn't see.\nAs he came closer I could see he had some sort of auto-gun, probably a rapid succession projectile launcher. It was on a shoulder strap. He did not raise it but he gripped the butt of the gun. I, on the other hand, had a pistol. He would probably cut me down if I tried for it. So I let him come to me. As he walked he staggered and I could see more of him take shape from the darkness. He wore light urban armor. On his helm he wore eye wear, on his face a smile formed.\n\"Mutual survival?\" he said loudly so I could hear him.\nWith those two words I knew he wasn't a threat.\n\"Sounds good to me!\" I said. I let go of my sword's hilt which was hidden behind my back and walked over to him with my arms extended.\nHe reached me and looked at me oddly. I could see in his eyes that he was still amused, wary. We exchanged stories of how we came to be here. He told me a story of how he had stolen grain for his family and killed an inspector who was chasing him.\n\"The Soache clan burned the cities and stole everything. When the people would stand up against them they would execute them.\" He paused for a moment. \"Or they would send them here.\"\nThe states of Soache and Soick had been the dominating force in our galaxy after the fall of the Empire. They plundered the loyalist planets after there no one was left to defend them. They were ruthless and wicked. Genocide was just a tool for peace to them. After the major purges of the loyalist states and after the smart ones hid away they turned into another bureaucratic system.\n\"And you? Are you a mad killer?\"\n\"No. I guess I'm one of those people that got caught in the middle and got sent here.\" He didn't ask for any details so I didn't tell him any more. I didn't even introduce myself. I wasn't sure if he should know my real name, not yet at least.\nThe stranger looked at the darkness about us.\nHe asked as he looked at his periphery in blindness, \"So what do you know about here?\"\n\"Not much. I've been here, maybe a few hours. It seems desolate. A beautiful sky,\" I said as I looked over the mans head. \"Hills over there,\" I pointed.\nWe looked around but no one was in sight. Others had been here. There were many tracks on the ground. As we moved away from what might be a danger zone we found little life. The landscape seemed to be bare, yet something not quite like grass carpeted what we could see. Everything was blue. The shadows were worlds of darkness, portals to every dark crack that led to that place we dare not go, the unknown. The hills led us to a vantage point where we could see a wide expanse of prairie. It was bald and looked like an easy passage.\nA few hours later we encountered a lone fugitive. He had been surviving here for months. He was dirty and unshaven, as was to be expected from people in his situation. What worried me was the expression on his face. There was no hope in his eyes.\n\"I saw the welcome lights and came to find out if we got anyone famous,\" said the new encounter. He moved closer two us and exposed the plasma weapon he wielded.\n\"I'm Gave. We're no threat really,\" said the stranger with me,\n\"I'm... Arathorn,\" I said not hiding my reservations.\n\"We'll see. Let's hike it back to my camp. It's probably not too safe here. It is too easy to be seen on this flat land and others, less friendly people may be on the way.\"\nHe led the way and we followed. He let us keep our arms. We trekked until we found a hole in the ground, It seemed to be the remains of an old complex.\n\"My name is Dajourn,\" he said, more relaxed. \"They call this world Budacon, I call it Darkensoul. Months I've been here without one minute of daylight!\"\nWe sat around a fire and told our stories of how we were banished to this dark world. He asked us what we remembered of life before here. He seemed to cherish all that was gone for him.\n\"So what is this I hear about a new terror in the galaxy?\" Dajourn asked. \"I hear there is a new power taking states from the Soache clans.\"\n\"Before I was banished I heard that they couldn't deal with political threats and a new war at the same time. That's why I'm here,\" Gave said as he looked at us both.\n\"The Soache clan is exporting more and more people so they won't join up with this mad man,\" said Gave.\n\"Bastards. It's this new Dread.\"\n\"But this 'dread' is not only in our part of the galaxy. This man has taken worlds from most states around in this sector. He's blitzkrieging through all the reform states. He's trying to bring back the Empire,\" Gave warned us.\n\"That would be good,\" said Dajourn as he stared into the fire.\n\"What? So he could be the Emperor?\" Gave spat out.\n\"I hear that this new threat to the break-away states is Eressar, the fallen general of the Emperor,\" I said.\n\"Who?\" Asked Dajourn.\n\"He died 75 years ago, When the last of the Empire fell, or so the legend goes,\" said Gave. \"That's about all I know about that. What do you know of him Arathorn?\n\"Do you want to hear a story? The story of Eressar's infinite sadness?\"\n\"For months I have been here with my conscience eating away my brain. Another day with no-one would drive me off the edge of sanity,\" said Dajourn nonchalantly.\nFor a moment there was silence. We stared at Dajourn for a moment. Dajourn shrugged and Gave spoke.\n\"Go on, Arathorn. I'd like to know of this tale.\"\nI shifted and made myself comfortable. I looked at the sky and tried to picture the story I would tell them. I thought for a moment.\n\"Well, about a hundred years ago there was a great warrior in the service of the dead Emperor. He had served in the ranks and had been promoted often because of his merits in battle. He soon became one of the youngest generals in the Imperial Whole. He guarded the Avalor Province, what are now the Soache and Soick break away states. Some say he was a descendant of the Emperor, or at least engineered from his genes. This was not true. As the Emperor was engineered to be perfect and to live for thousands of years, Eressar was just a man, son of a merchant. He was to die like any other man.\n\"Sometime before the end of the Empire there had been diplomatic talks with states on the verge of breaking away. Eressar was chosen to hold a session with the province of Chicago, one of the oldest and most prestigious 'states' in the Empire. It was a strong state with ambitious leaders. He met a girl during one of the banquets that was very interested in him. He did his duty first and tried to work with the leaders of the state. When it seemed that no headway could be made he looked for her. Her name was Saricca.\n\"She was at first angry at him because he not had time for her. But that was not so. She was very beautiful.\n\"Eressar went to his home protectorate and his ship the Imperial Sentinel Hugo. There he kept communications with Bragand the chosen leader of the State of Chicago, and of course Saricca. They would be together for hours using the Imperial-Sky-Net. And their love blossomed.\n\"As time went on and they desired each other more Saricca came to Eressar. It was during the days of thanks and celebration, a holiday. The warlord found peace and was happy. He knew he truly loved this woman. He asked her to stay with him. She hesitated and went back to her home to put her life in order. When she went home she realized that this could not be. That her father Bragand would not let her go. Eressar called for her constantly leaving messages that told her that he loved her and that he was in pain without her. She could not tell Eressar. Instead she sent him a communiqu\u00e9.\n\"She told Eressar whom her father was. Eressar left a missive for her telling her that he understood and that he still loved her.\n\"She wrote back saying, '...Don't make me feel guilty now. I'm sorry for not telling you but I'm exhausted now. I'm a little fool. I'm not happy either but I can't deal with our relationship, not now. Please wait, I can't take this pressure you're making now...'\"\n\"General Eressar came and went in silence. Everyone on his ship knew that something was wrong. They looked at him for guidance but now he would go to places where no one would be. He would disappear and contemplate his numbness. He revelled in his pain.\"\nThe two were enthralled. Dajourn was lost in the story. Gave looked at him with interest. He paid close attention trying to figure out something about me. I went on.\n\"Months went by when they would talk very little. Whenever they talked he would leave sad and dejected. He would go to be alone. He could not breath because when he did he felt the sadness and the anguish of his loss. Then he got a communiqu\u00e9 from her:\n'...I'm communicating because I thought of you last night and I felt bad that we haven't talked in a while. Major things are happening here. I wanted to say one thing to you, and that's thank you. You cared so much about me, even though you barely know me. I don't have anyone like that, basically I won't let anybody in. This keeps me protected from people, but sometimes it can be really lonely. I can't now, not with all the preparation for war here. So thanks for trying so hard with me, and for listening, and for being there. I'll never forget that. I pray that things will work out the confederation and the Empire.'\"\nI paused and looked up at the stars. I thought my eyes would give me away and shed a tear. They did not and I took a deep breath and went on.\n\"It was a pleasant communiqu\u00e9 but at the same time he did not see that it was a type of release for her. It smacked of closure. The situation between the confederation, the states and the Empire deteriorated into a big intergalactic mess. War was on everyone's tongues. And then it came.\n\"Several states had broken with the Empire years before the actual war started. While they posed no physical threat to Empire the policy was to let them be. Suddenly the confederation states attacked and dozens of other provinces changed sides or became neutral. The Empire was still very strong. It had great amounts of force spread about the galaxy. Where they did not have the force of arms or numbers they had great leaders. Eressar was very important to the rebellion. He could rally the Empire and smash the rebels now that a conflict had begun.\n\"A major attack force of seven battle cruisers teleported to the Hugo which was in orbit over the capital of Avalor, the planet Val-Gilad. The crew of the Hugo gave a gallant fight destroying four of the attacking ships but the ships waiting in reserve engaged. The Hugo was boarded. Eressar took the situation in and was prepared to win the battle or scuttle the ship. With his will he could have destroyed the ship and eventually put down the rebels. As he sat there directing fighter craft and ordering salvo launches he came upon a revelation. These last ships were of Chicagoan design. He sat there astonished.\n\"He stared at the ongoing battle. He focused on one of his fighters. His Air Wing had destroyed all enemy fighter craft, but this one was going into an attack run against a cruiser. The craft's sleek lines shined brightly against explosions. Its swan-like form moved smoothly toward the enemy ship and dodged a battery of heated plasma. The speed of his fighter could be seen against the girth of the ship. Lines of ports on the ship's hull glowed as it charged for another fusillade. The pilot must have known that this was his last move. He increased speed to ram the opposing ship but it was no use. The fighter was lost on a hail of plasma discharge.\n\"He sensed an unknown feeling of despair. Then his worst fears were confirmed. He received a message from one of the assaulting ships. It was Saricca.\n'I am leading the final assault. Give up or die.'\nThere was no emotion on her face. There was nothing. She could have been a machine. He had one reply:\n'Never.'\n\"And with that he gave his last orders and his heart died. His command center was attacked as he saw Saricca this one last time. His heart sunk and he wished only to die like that pilot. His crew fought valiantly but after he fell their heart was dead. He was struck down by a young soldier. His armor survived most blows but this young warrior closed in and ejected a plasma weapon at close range. The boy was instantly incinerated. The general's already damaged chest plate was blown completely off his body. But he was alive. His aide, who admired him greatly, went to his side.\n'Let me die, Ward please..' His voice was a garbled by his injuries.\n'Never sir!' he replied.\nWard teleported him to a cryogenic stasis lab in the bowels of the Hugo. Ward could not save himself though. Before he could himself escape he was gunned down by a another wave of invaders.\n\"The enemy then left, assuming Eressar's death. The Hugo was left in orbit as a monument to the fall of the Empire. There it stayed for years until its orbit decayed and it crashed into the dead planet Val-Gilad.\"\nThere was a pause as the two of them took in the story.\n\"What then? He survived all those years and then someone rescued him?\", Gave asked sardonically.\n\"Well not exactly. He just awakened. The pain had gone. After his injuries were healed he was put into a hibernation state where he dreamed for half a century. His pain was gone. He was ready to redeem himself.\"\n\"Bullshit. Like we're suppose to believe he woke himself up in a hibernated state? After fifty or more years?\" Gave said in disbelief.\n\"It's the truth, he just awakened,\" I said.\n\"How did you know all this?\" Dajourn asked actually being curious.\n\"Are you this great conqueror's story teller? Were you imprisoned here because you told some governor's children this faithless story?\", Gave said mockingly.\nI let it go. I called it a night and went to bed. The others stayed and argued about my story and how plausible it was.\nAfter a long time in darkness there the bright light that signified the teleportation pad stirred us. We went to see six Old Imperial ships breaking formation and spreading out over the landscape. From their bellies dozens of craft left.\n\"My troops have found me,\" I said calmly.\n\"You're the One?\", said Dajourn.\n\"Yes I am.\"\nGave looked at me, and tried to rationalize in his head how this could be true.\n\"I am the last of the Emperor's generals.\" I said to them both. \"I will make good what I let go of\", I said as the a draft of air from of a bird-like ship landed near us.\nI looked at them both and explained, \"You see I was separated from my armies in a reconnaissance mission into a Soache world. Actually I left my armies because...I had to lose my pain, lose the madness. The Soache presumed I was a lone terrorist. If they had known who I was surely they would have killed me. I would guess there is not much left of their garrison now.\"\nGave then lunged at Dajourn and took his only security, his gun. He pointed it at me.\n\"You're going to die! I'm going to kill the last link to the Empire!.\" I could see the look of insanity in his eyes. \"In killing you I will be immortal!\"\n\"Not after they gun you down Gave!\", said Dajourn, who was standing in a defensive posture. Gave didn't care.\nGave activated the gun and its port started to glow. It exploded in his hands and his surprised faced was engulfed by the exploding weapon. His mutilated body fell to the ground with a lifeless thud.\n\"They gave me that gun because they knew it wouldn't work,\" said Dajourn.\nHe stared at Gave's body, stunned by his misfortune. If the gun worked I could not stop him. But I knew somehow I would not die, not here, not now. I had to restore what was lost. I had to fix what had passed.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The stones had long been smoothed by the buffeting currents, but now slowed and stagnated as the currents rushed toward the colder regions where my colonin could not go. Our sensitive skin could not tolerate the icy water. It was a place of intense vibrations. Huge plates of rocks shifts and sea beds crumbled to jut as mountains and deep canyons. Nor could we ascend to the huge wall of ice; it formed an irregular dome, filled with cracks and bumpy icicles. My colonin and I could sense this, not from touching it with our delicate tentacles and tails, but by high-pitched chirps which would return to us with an echo. With these chirps, we could feel everything and know all that was coming. For this reason we knew we must leave our beloved reef, for ChiZeks were rushing toward us from the north.\nChiZeks were always savage predators. They shed a row of teeth a year, only to jut forth two new rows, longer and sharper than the row lost. ChiZeks bristled with poisonous spines and webbed claws. Its six eyes scanned every direction. It never slept, but dozed, floating with the current, its spines instinctively undulating over the swirling weeds. Luckily I could always hear when a ChiZek was approaching. Its fierce, double heartbeat and the chilling rattle of poison-spines always gave it away. Whenever I heard either of these, I would dive through the swaying weeds and hide in the basin of the smooth lava labyrinth. Most ChiZeks happened to be very stupid, for they never smelled me, though its pungent stench overwhelmed my senses.\nNow, in the far distance, at least twenty-six sea-circles, I could hear the ChiZeks migrating in mass from the frozen ice regions to our warm, weed-waters, searching for food. I knew they weren't close enough to harm me, or any of my colonin, but I listened so closely, it felt as though my ears might bleed from the strain. Nervously, I bit into a tough, fibrous stalk and ground in my small, rounded rows of teeth. A lethargic Bukae, a dome-shelled, slow moving sea-bed dweller, stirred up a cloud of sand. I didn't mind the Bukaes. They fed peaceably on small, scrub-plants and never bothered us.\nA smooth, tiny body nudged my side.\n\"Little Netu! Why are you here? Why aren't you with the colonin?\"\n\"Always worrying about me, Qizi! Can't I eat on my own too?\"\nNetu brushed the half-chewed stalk with her small pointed nose.\n\"Why are you eating this,\" cried Netu. \"We slurp out the flowerets hiding in the stalks. We don't eat the stalks, do we?\"\n\"I'm nervous, so I'm chewing.\" I snapped up a fresh stalk and gnawed on it viciously. \"Netu, go back to the colonin. It's safer there.\"\n\"No! Please! I don't like being in the colonin. The other hatchlings are so stupid!\"\n\"Go back to the colonin.\"\n\"But mamma!\"\n\"Don't call me mamma. You know only tiny hatchlings use that. Besides, you are being cared for by the maternas.\"\n\"But you're my mamma, not the maternas! They're old, scaly and always sliming their tongues all over me.\"\n\"That's because they love you. There are trying to be affectionate!\"\nLittle Netu rubbed her spindly tentacle hard against the left side of her pointed nose.\n\"They did it this morning too!\"\n\"Please, get back to the colonin. We'll be leaving soon.\"\n\"What? ChiZeks? Are they close? Can I see one? Will they rip any heads off?\"\n\"They're close, but no heads are going to get ripped off. Get going!\"\nI nudged Netu and she reluctantly glided on the stream and vanished into the swirling weeds where the colonin lived. I loved Netu. She was one of the few hatchling who had survived.\nI lifted my head, but there was no need to. I could hear the approaching ChiZeks easily in the still water. Their vicious heartbeat and sharp clattering spines grew louder until my tentacles curled in fear. I ripped off another stalk and chewed until the bitter juice flowed plentifully around my head.\nThey cannot be more than twenty-two sea-circles away now, I thought. In two sleep cycles they will be here.\nI spat out the loathsome stalk and spread my tail into a full fan. With one swift beat and my four tentacles flattened against my side, I plunged quickly into the heart of the weeds.\nThe whole colonin floated, waiting for the command of the Head- Materna. She refused to leave, however, until all the young hatchlings were swimming in a straight line.\n\"Not until there in a perfect line can we leave,\" the Head-Materna grumbled, flicking her tentacles in impatience.\"The little hatchling will scatter before we're half-way there. Then we'll have to waste our time looking all over for them.\"\n\"We promised to keep them together,\" I cried.\"Can't we just go? The ChiZeks are fast approaching. I heard them the whole sleep-cycle!\"\n\"What does it matter if they're all together?\"\n\"Quiet! Or I'll order the colonin to leave you and all your precious hatchling, Qizi!\"\nI lowered my head and slowly curled my tentacles in submission.\n\"Good. Now straighten the line more - more. That's good. Keep it there.\"\nThe Head-Materna swam in a broad circle around the excited hatchlings. Many of them waved their tentacles wildly, though we taught them it wasn't polite. The Head-Materna merely flattened her long tail menacingly and the hatchlings straightened their tentacles against their sides. Netu was in middle of the line. She was larger than most of the hatchlings, but then again, she was older. In fifty-seven sleep-wake cycles, she would be an adult. Then she would have to travel across the deep water valley murky with the fuming cone formations. These stone cones spouted heat and acrid-tasting water into the swirling current.\n\"Good,\" cried the Head-Materna,\"Now we shall go.\"\nI took my position to the rear-left of the central hatchling line. I watched as all the young mothers and elderly maternas formed and an impenetrable circle. The Head-Materna led the way at the center. We obediently followed her without the slightest deviation. The Head-Materna had always led us to the safest ground and even though I new the age-old route as well as any of the maternas, I was content to keep my position and watch little Netu flail her small, flat tail with an air of independence, although she almost fell out of line many times.\n\"Netu, keep in line. You know what the Head-Materna said!\"\n\"But the Head-Maternas is a -\"\n\"Shhh! Netu - back in line.\"\nNetu obeyed.\nThe maternas muttered scornfully:\n\"She should not be calling you `mamma' at her age. Very childish. We are her true mothers.\"\nThe lava labyrinth crept along the seabed for twenty-eight sea-circles. It was one of the largest stone labyrinths we knew and better yet, it flourished with thick weeds and edible stalk-flowerets. The small cracks in some of the labyrinth gushed heat and minerals which the plants thrived on. We followed this long winding labyrinth until we reached its end and then dove into its deepest crevices to sleep. While the others slid a thin, opaque film over their eyes, I broke the Head-Materna's strict code and snuck into the hatchling line to visit Netu.\nNetu raised her head groggily.\n\"Mamma, do I have to sleep with the other hatchlings? Aren't I old enough yet?\"\n\"You'll be old enough when you stop calling me, mamma. But yes, you are getting to be a bit too big to be with the hatchlings.\"\n\"It's so tight in here, but the others fit fine. Can I sleep with you and the other adults? The hatchlings always steal my space.\"\n\"But that means you'd also have to be by the maternas.\"\n\"I don't care. I'm so sick of being here.\"\n\"All right. Let's go then.\"\nNetu eagerly darted out of her tiny space and curled her tentacles around me so she could get a free ride. I then nestled Netu into the safest spot first and then snuggled beside her.\n\"Mamma, when will I see a ChiZek?\"\n\"Hopefully never. Your brothers and sisters were killed by a ChiZek. It was lucky you weren't.\"\n\"I was eating with you, I remember.\"\n\"That's right. And the others were with a materna. She was killed too.\"\n\"ChiZeks are really evil, aren't they?\"\n\"Very, very evil.\"\n\"But what about Bukae? Aren't they evil?\"\n\"They just eat plants and sleep. They can't harm you.\"\n\"Then why was a Bukae looking at me so funny?\"\n\"A Bukae? Where? I didn't see one.\"\n\"Silly! A Bukae was hiding in the weeds!\"\n\"But Bukaes don't like the weeds. They only like the ocean bed.\"\n\"I swear, I saw a -\"\n\"Where was it? Show me.\"\nNetu hovered low over the labyrinth and wound carefully through the weeds. She stopped suddenly and pointed with her tentacle.\n\"There's the Bukae. It's been eating animals too!\"\n\"What?\"\nI squeaked out a high pitch cry which returned quickly to me, revealing a thick bed of weeds. At the center was a small, flat boulder in which the round-shelled Bukae rested. I was certain, however, this Bukae was a strange mutation (as I had sometimes found among the Bukaes). It had the typical domed, smooth shell, but it had a pronounced, pointed nose and stiffer fins. It also had the strangest mouth, a long, tentacle-like appendage in which it would suck up its food in a gulp. And as Netu said, the Bukae wasn't eating plants, but animals.\n\"Keep away from it, Netu. It might want eat us too.\"\nNetu darted swiftly away from the tentacle appendage which continued to forage among the weeds. A skittering \"sand-spike\" was suddenly caught under its deadly suction. It vanished completely, with only a slight stir in the sand.\n\"Mamma, I thought no creature eats sand-spikes! Not even the ChiZeks!\"\n\"That's right. They're too sharp. How could a Bukae eat it? They're soft on the inside.\"\n\"This Bukae might have internal armor.\"\n\"Don't be foolish, Netu. No creature has `internal armor.'\"\nI wound my tentacle around Netu and rushed back into the labyrinth. The Head-Materna was sleeping peacefully in her angular nook. I felt bad waking her, but nudged her anyway. An animal-eating Bukae!\n\"Head-Materna! Wake up! Please!\"\nThe second eye-lid, opaque and glassy rolled back. The Head-Materna looked at me, then Netu, before she brushed Netu away out of my grasp with her tail.\n\"How many times, Netu, have I told you I'm your mother? Don't go -\"\n\"Head-Materna! The Bukae ate a sand-spike,\" cried Netu.\n\"What? Impossible! No Bukae can even eat a tube-worm!\"\n\"But it did, I swear!\"\nThe Head-Materna glared at me.\n\"Are you teaching your young hatchling to lie,\" demanded the Head-Materna.\n\"Look! The Bukae is eating sand-spikes, just as Netu said!\"\n\"Nonsense! Maternas! Awake! We have Qizi and Netu to deal with... Troublesome pair.\"\nThe maternas slowly awoke and wriggled out of their tight stone nook. Two maternas remained to watching over the sleeping hatchlings, nestled at the center of the lava-labyrinth. I watched as the maternas groggily swam our way. From the they thrashing of their tails and the curling their tentacles, I could tell they were angry. I shot out a brief, high-pitched cry which returned to me swiftly, revealing nothing but swaying weeds. The Bukae either had left or was above the weeds. I knew the Bukae was dangerous and must be found. Surely the maternas would not follow me. I was not as important as the hatchlings and nowhere close in rank to the Head-Materna. I felt Netu swimming nervously beside me and on a sudden impulse, I curled my tentacle tightly around one of hers and shot up and over the tall weeds. Netu was so unprepared, she hung like a heavy stone while I dragged her into the clear water. I shrieked a louder, longer cry and when it returned to me, I could locate the Bukae. It had not moved far, merely one and a half sea-circles from its original position. At least it was moving slowly, like all the other Bukaes.\n\"Stop her! The hatchling! Bring the hatchling back!\"\nThe Head-Materna burst from the weeds, followed by an explosion of infuriated maternas. They swarmed furiously, weaving in and out of their dense cluster, reaching us with incredible speed. Just half a sea-circle short of the dangerous Bukae, the Head-Materna shot out with her long tentacle at Netu. Netu batted it violently with her tail, but the Head-Maternas grabbed a fin and tried to yank her out of my grasp. I tried to hold on, but when I heard her shriek, I let go and watched as the Head-Materna wrapped Netu securely in her four tentacles and swam safely out of my reach.\n\"Evil Qizi! You would kill your own hatchling? Your only hatchling?\"\n\"Not kill! I wanted to save - to show you the Bukae. It's dangerous. You must see -\"\n\"No! We must punish you first,\" the Head-Materna cried.\" For trying to kill your hatchling, we must slash one of your fins. Escape from the ChiZek then! If you survive, you shall live without us - and your hatchling.\"\nTwo maternas grabbed me on both sides and entangled me completely. I struggled, but could not loosen their grip even slightly. They both lowered me down to the sea floor and pressed me against a flat, round boulder. A third materna swam toward me with a sharp rock. I shrieked piercingly, hoping to hurt their ears enough that they might let me go, but they didn't even wince. The materna on my left slipped her tentacle away from the base of my fin. The sharpened rock grew closer. I thrashed violently, now trying to dig my teeth into one of their tentacles. I flipped over onto one side and nearly bit into one before the blinding pain and that awful smell of one's own blood.\nPain throbbed, then drained out of my left fin only to be replaced by a vague needle sensation over my skin. For a moment, I thought I had brushed against a venomous plant or creature and I was slowly being poisoned. But instead, it was merely my fin losing sensation from the loss of blood. They did not cut off the fin completely, but severed it half way up. I opened my mouth and blood flooded in. It was nauseating.\n\"Now let us see this Bukae,\" cried the Head-Materna.\nI sent out a weak, short-distance cry and found they were all swarming near the Bukae in curiosity. I gagged on the blood, then thrashed my tail toward the Head-Materna, hoping to get Netu away.\n\"Look at this! Harmless, just like any other Bukae.\"\nThe Head-Materna prodded its smooth shell with her tail. The Bukae was horribly still. I propelled myself swiftly through the water. The dizziness began to heighten. I kept myself alert by constantly shooting warning signals at the maternas.\n\"Get away, Qizi! Go! Leave us forever, unless you want us to cut off your fin completely!\"\nThe wound began to burn. The maternas hoarded around the Head-Maternas and beat me with their tails.\n\"Let me through! The Bukae!\"\nSomething long, but flexible bumped against me. I dropped down in the water while the maternas scattered. I heard a swift rush of water. I wished all my blood might drain away when I heard Netu's shriek. Despairingly, I cried out toward the Bukae, but found it was gone. Instead it was charging toward the lava-labyrinth in a panic. I darted out of its path and fell into one of the labyrinth's narrowest passages. The Bukae raced over the surface, but swerved in the wrong direction. The thickest weeds entangled one of its fins. It tugged furiously before it collapsed onto the stone labyrinth, breaking off the underside of its shell. The cold, smooth shell drifted down toward me and lay heavily on the stone, over my head. Another piece of shell then drifted down and then another. I didn't understand how this could be happening, since it crashed at least half a sea-circle away. A small body passed by me, then stopped to nudged me in its old, affectionate way.\n\"Netu!\"\n\"Mamma! Look! The Bukae's broke its shell.\"\n\"Yes, I know. But what happened to you?\"\n\"The Head-Materna got eaten. I escaped though. I was too fast for it.\"\n\"My wonderful, clever little Netu!\"\nI moved close to curl my tentacle around her, but a sharp pain burned in my fin again. I shied away.\n\"Does it still hurt,\" asked Netu.\n\"Very much.\"\n\"Will the ChiZeks be here soon?\"\n\"Yes. I hear them. Their heartbeats and clattering spines are very loud. I'm sure you can hear them - by now.\"\n\"Yes, that's why I'm pulling down the shell. It's very easy.\"\n\"But what good will that do?\"\n\"If you can't move, then we'll have to stay, right?\"\nNetu waved her tail, impatient for a response, but when I gave her none, she swam away and returned with another piece of the shell.\n\"Netu, this is useless. The ChiZeks will be able to smell us. They'll come after - the blood.\"\n\"No they won't! If you can't bite through a Bukae shell, they can't get to us.\"\nThe two remaining maternas crawled through the lava-labyrinth, staying close to their cluster of hatchlings.\n\"What, Qizi,\" one cried.\"You're hurt?\"\n\"Yes, didn't you hear from the Head-Materna?\"\n\"We did, but we didn't believe it.\"\n\"Please, help Netu. Can't you hear them? The ChiZeks will be here by tonight's sleep-cycle.\"\nThe maternas bowed their heads in assent and helped Netu rip off the rest of the cracked under-shell. Occasionally the wounded Bukae would sway violently in the water, trying to free itself from the imprisoning weeds. Other times it would unfurl its suction-tentacle, but now it thrashed so uselessly, we were certain it was dying. Many times we might have taken compassion on the poor creature, but the ChiZeks would be here by tonight and we needed its shell for protection.\nWhen the last shell was fitted in place, we secured it in the toughest weeds and floweret-stalks. It formed a crude dome, filled with many cracks and inverted curves, but it was enough to protect one whole sea-circle across the lava-labyrinth. We herded the squirming hatchlings together at the center. The maternas, Netu, and I remained on the outside of the hatchling circle. I continually ordered Netu to take her place among the hatchlings, where it was the safest under the largest span of complete shell, but she always refused. She instead swam around in agitated excitement, eager to see the first ChiZek, and if the dome worked. I was more nervous and afraid. Although the pain from my wounded fin hardly made me value my life, I knew if the shell gave out, the ChiZeks would jam their sharp-toothed mouths into the labyrinth in a frenzy of hunger, driven by my own blood.\nIt was half way through the sleep-cycle when the first dull thud echoed off the dome. We all awoke and stared at the protective ceiling. Another heavy thud echoed in the silence. I could hear the fierce heartbeats of the ChiZeks and their clattering spines brushing against the shell. As the attack grew fiercer, teeth and claws scratched against the dome. One desperate ChiZek threw all its weight against one shell piece. The shell was dislocated, but it did not crack. The weeds woven around the outer pieces kept it in place well enough. But through the cracks we could see the swarming ChiZeks, mad with hunger and blood. Their mouths gaped, revealing rows of razor teeth and their spines bristled, sharp and deadly. A clawed fin jutted through one crack and swiped; we pressed ourselves flat against the floor. The claw's range swept short of us and eventually slipped away.\nThe exasperated ChiZeks, near the wake-cycle, scattered in search of new prey. They snapped up anything in sight, larval crawlers, water-beaters, rotating jelly-globules. Even slinking, blind worms wriggling their way beneath the sand's surface. The ChiZeks found their greatest meal when they smashed against the wounded Bukae and the last of its shell gaped wide. A great bubble escaped its inside and long, spindly creatures floated in the water: obviously the last thing the Bukae ate. The ChiZeks snatched these up and in a single bite, crushed and swallowed them.\nThree sleep-wake cycles passed since the ChiZeks left, searching for new food. Netu dared to go out and pick up a few more pieces from the shattered Bukae, lying dead on the sea floor. The maternas insisted we leave this place and find the same area we always fed and lived, according to the age-old dictates of the Head-Materna.\n\"But why do we have to leave,\" cried Netu,\"we have plenty of food here. And we're safe too. So are the hatchlings. We couldn't find a better place.\"\nNetu shifted the strange odds and ends she gathered from the dead Bukae. She picked up a thin, pointed object. I assumed it was the Bukae's tooth.\n\"Besides,\" said Netu.\"Mamma is hurt. She needs to heal first. We can do that by staying here awhile.\"\nNetu waved her fin happily. This was the first time she called me \"mamma\" without having to worry about the Head-Materna. She floated over to the nearest wall and began to scape the stone with it. The rasping sound was very annoying. The maternas and most of the hatchling shied away from the sound. A few stayed and watched in curiosity, as I did. After sending out a few, low-pitched sounds, I could interpret what Netu was doing. She was carving little figures in the rock.\n\"See, this is you and this is me,\" muttered Netu.\"And this is the Head-Materna and this is the Bukae.\"\nNetu carved into the rock every detail, from our leaving our original feeding ground to here. She carved my flight with her, the Head-Materna capturing her and my wounding. Finally, with the last carving in place, after the ChiZek attack, Netu included one last curious figure I could not understand.\n\"What is that Netu?\"\n\"Why, that's me, with you and everyone. I'm carving here and this is the dead Bukae nearby.\"\n\"But what is that, beneath the Bukae?\"\n\"Why, that's its name,\" cried Netu.\"That's where I got the idea to draw. It was stuck right on its side. No Bukae I knew had that on its side before.\"\nI sent out one last signal and when it reflected off the wall and returned to me, the name made no sense. It meant no more to me than the formation of random rocks on the sea floor. It had no sound, no image, no life. All Netu carved beneath the image of the dead Bukae were the jagged marks: NASA.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

However, he inadvertently revived Amanuensis (\"Manny\"), the multitalented datadroid with whom he was confined, and the two escaped from the slave quarters. On the Concourse - while seeking sanctuary with the local agent of the alien Rulatuvani - Bobby and Manny encountered the Security Garda, and ducked into the antique shop of M. Kandu. While Bobby admired Kandu's valuable antique Website datacards, the shady dealer saw an opportunity and captured the two valuable data operatives. He intended selling them, himself, as slaves.\nBobby and Manny reached an agreement with Kandu. The dealer promised to sell them to a person or organization of their choice if they cooperated with him in this illegal enterprise of commercial theft. Bobby was sent by Kandu to a public dataterminal on the Concourse to steal Kivo Artish's slave records so Kandu could alter them and file them in his own account to provide a seeming legality for the sale of his captive datadroid and datajack.\nBobby had seized root-control in the Arcade central computer's NUNIX operating system, and was in the process of transferring Kivo Artish's records of himself and Amanuensis to Kandu's account for alteration, when he felt the touch of cold metal on the back of his neck.\n\"Don't even think about running, Crawley,\" said a high-pitched voice, which sounded to Bobby like that of a nonhumanoid. \"Please continue with your records deletion... Then, remove your illegal root-account from our central computer.\"\nBobby had lowered his robe's cowl - that of a Brother of the Order of the Holy Fire. He had been turned by Kandu into a bearded member of that Order - all for nought, it seemed.\nHe did as he was told, without looking around to learn the identity of his new captor. But the fellow's word, \"our,\" was an ominous reminder of the ubiquity of Arcade's security. \"I hope you've got a good reason for allowing me to steal myself from Kivo Artish - whoever you are.\"\n\"The oldest reason in the universe, Crawley: greed... So you thought you could use your WebPoss techniques here on Arcade, did you?\"\n\"Why not? The NUNIX system is a Swiss cheese. It was reasonable for me to believe you'd only plugged a few of its holes. And you had.\"\n\"But I caught you, anyway... Can you guess why?\"\n\"You put an alarm-applet on Artish's records because you thought I might try to alter them. I got careless and forgot to look for such things... I guess I'm not as good as I think I am... You must be the station's data-security chief.\"\n\"Wrong. I'm merely a plainclothes detective. But I got the computer man to install an alarm, just like you said. You're mine, now - Brother Robert.\" Bobby would forever be stigmatized for his long-time membership in the datacult, Web Possibilities, Ltd... He removed his illegal root-account from the central computer.\n\"Okay. I've cleaned up my dirty work.\" He turned to face a short, beady-eyed policeman. (\"Oh, God. A damned Rat.\") He sneered, \"Do you have a name, Sherlock Holmes?\"\nThe detective was a Quartorian, a near-humanoid species. His face resembled that of the familiar, omnipresent rodent of Old Earth. He had a long, pointed nose and short rat-whiskers which twitched as he continually sniffed the air - for what Bobby couldn't guess. His skin was grayish, but lacked any rodent-fur. This species had produced several well-known detectives, and they were sought for police and private security positions by the Galaxy's more-fearful employers. Many, though, distrusted them.\n\"Of course. Just because I'm not a human doesn't mean I don't have a name. But my honorable name's only for my clan, and not for you, Crawley.\" He showed his teeth; his rodential incisors were the most visible. Bobby wondered if the guy had to chew on hard stuff to keep them down to a manageable size. He kept this and other provocative speculations to himself, though.\n\"Just call me 'Ratt' - with two 't's, please. I know that's what you're thinking.\"\nBobby smiled wanly. \"So what's next, Detective Ratt?\"\n\"I want to know where you're hiding that lummox datadroid.\"\n(\"Does Ratt know about Manny's 'defensive' talents? If not, he might just have to learn about them the hard way. I've got to search for the police records and find out what they know about Manny and me.\")\n\"I want the two of you to remain confined until I can make some arrangements. Then, I want you gone from Arcade - and me rich.\" He clicked his incisors together in an unmistakable gesture.\n\"A crooked cop... Is there anyone on this miserable cheesebox who doesn't want to sell me and get rich?!\"\nRatt smirked. \"Reverend Davey, maybe. At the Full Gospel Chapel, he tries to reform juvenile delinquents like you.\"\nThe Detective retrieved Amanuensis from Kandu's workroom, where he was still standing in the corner. Kandu put on an elaborate show of innocence, claiming that the android was a burglar he'd caught.\n\"I was holding him for the Garda... Is there a reward for him?\"\nDetective Ratt replied, \"Yes, Kandu. Your reward is no punishment for your complicity in the escape and attempted resale of two registered slaves... Provided you forget everything, that is.\"\nAfter receiving Kandu's abject apology and his assurance that the two escaped slaves were no longer his concern, Ratt escorted Bobby and Amanuensis into the Maze. Bobby gave the android a highsign to request that he not take \"action\" against the detective, yet.\nAfter many twists and turns, they arrived at a private compartment. It was a bit more luxurious than the policeman's status and salary would have normally entitled him to. Bobby was certain the smarmy detective had his hands into many nefarious enterprises - the kind that were so prevalent on Arcade.\n\"This is my former mistress's compartment. Unfortunately she was banished from Arcade for possessing the psychodrug, nephedrine... I arrested her, myself... You two'll stay here until your new owner is ready to ship you out. There's food enough for you, Crawley - but don't count on using that terminal in a creative way. I had our data security man cripple it at the central computer. You can use it to read the Code of Conduct, though,\" he snickered.\nWith that caveat, Ratt closed the compartment's door and locked it from the outside. Bobby and Amanuensis looked at each other. \"Did Ratt lock his mistress inside here? No wonder she took dope... What a thug he is.\"\n\"I could have neutralized him, sir.\"\n\"I know, Manny. But I need some time to think... We're just going from one evil opportunist to another. We've got to get to get to Jerash Norin's tailor shop.\"\n\"I will open the door, sir.\"\n\"Not yet, Manny. I want to check something.\"\nHe sat down at the terminal and began pounding the keys. Before he could accomplish anything, it chimed and a message appeared on the screen: \"THIS TERMINAL IS NOT AUTHORIZED FOR INTERACTIVE USE.\"\n\"We'll see about that.\" He tried every trick he could think of to access the central computer. \"I've never had so much trouble, before,\" he explained to Amanuensis. \"He must have hardwired this terminal out of the loop - or something... Damn.\"\nHe stood up and pointed at the door. \"Do your thing, Manny.\"\nRatt's electrolock was the same type as Kivo Artish's. It quickly yielded to Amanuensis' deft touch.\nDetective Ratt had been so confident he'd canceled the Wanted Notice for the two escaped slaves. With the Garda no longer seeking them, Bobby and Amanuensis were able to hasten to Jerash Norin's tailor shop... When they reached the shop, they received yet another surprise.\nNorin had been arrested, and his shop had been sealed.\n\"How the heck did Ratt find out about Norin?\"\n\"Perhaps the tailor committed an unrelated crime, sir.\"\n\"Maybe... But I think Ratt knows more about us and the Rulatuvani than I gave him credit for... Where do we go, now?\"\n\"The Full Gospel Chapel, perhaps. I am not a juvenile, but you could represent me as your servant, sir.\"\n\"Oh great - a juvenile delinquent with his Paramount datadroid... Even a preacher couldn't be naive enough to believe that.\"\n\"Where did you obtain this expensive 'droid, my son?\"\nThe Reverend Davey Wilfurd stared at Bobby and Manny over his half-moon reading spectacles. He was in his fifties, tall, his hair streaked with gray. He sat at the altar-table before his lectern. He'd pushed aside the altar's golden cross so he could write notes for his Sunday sermon... He'd looked up to behold a young fellow and, seemingly, a monster he recalled from the old videos he'd secretly watched in his own youth.\nThey'd requested sanctuary.\n\"I'll level with you, Reverend. I and my 'droid are escaped slaves. We escaped from Kivo Artish's slave quarters.\" He didn't mention they'd also escaped from M. Kandu and D. Ratt.\nWilfurd took off his glasses. \"Well, you know slavery is legal here. If I hid you in my Chapel, I could get in big trouble with the Arcade Management.\" He pondered the situation for a moment, then, \"Tell me about yourselves.\"\nBobby gave him a censored version of their backgrounds.\n\"So you worked for WebPoss, but you had to God-given sense to escape before that madman Dee made his flock commit suicide. That's most gratifying to hear... I suppose you learned a lot of useful skills at WebPoss?\"\n\"Yes, I did.\" (\"What's he getting at?\")\n\"Well, if you could teach me some of them, I might be able to risk hiding you from the Garda. Of course, I only want to learn enough datajacking help the less-fortunate here on Arcade.\"\n\"Of course.\" Bobby fought to keep from smirking.\n\"Often, I'm asked to assist people who conceal their circumstances from me. It would help me to be able to access official personnel records which are denied to the public... You see?\"\n\"Oh, yes. That's a good idea, Reverend.\" (\"Boy. This really takes the cake: a holy wannabe-datajack.\")\n\"While we're burrowing into the station's central computer, perhaps we can take the opportunity to arrange your escape from Arcade.\"\n\"I sure hope so, Rev.\"\n\"I want to know why you removed the Wanted Notice for my two escaped slaves from the public dataterminals?\"\nKivo Artish was quite annoyed, but he knew better than to berate Ratt. The detective had a reputation for ruthlessness, but he was trusted by the Management and the Garda Chief. Artish, however, trusted no Quartorian - especially this one, who had created such a secure position for himself that he feared no entrepreneur.\n\"I've received reliable intelligence that your two slaves have been smuggled out of Arcade, Mr. Artish. I'm in the process of verifying that, but I judge it to be true. They were too valuable to remain in hiding, here. Allowing them to escape was equivalent to dropping a couple of 100-credit gold pieces in the Concourse, I'm afraid.\"\n\"I want proof of your claim, Detective.\" Artish ignored Ratt's gratuitous analogy.\n\"If you don't hear from me to the contrary, you'll know it's true... Now, I have work to do. Good day, sir.\"\nKivo Artish scowled, but left. There was little he could do about the missing slaves but file an insurance claim. The insurance company, a big one, would take up the task of annoying Detective Ratt - to avoid paying the claim. (\"Let's see him handle their investigators so rudely,\") he thought, with satisfaction.\nBobby worried that Detective Ratt would recall his jocular reference to Reverend Davey, and come to the Full Gospel Chapel seeking the thrice-escaped delinquents.\nHe hastened to tutor the preacher, who was an avid student. Often, after a datajacking success, Wilfurd would exclaim, \"Praise the Lord!\" - or something similar. Bobby found this amusing.\nWhile teaching the preacher datajacking skills, Bobby had the opportunity to jack intelligence data on himself and Amanuensis.\nHe found a police report which detailed his history. Only his love affair with his former datahandling associate and girlfriend, Ranavalona, was missing... He also found out about Amanuensis. The android had been owned by a superwealthy media magnate, Delbert Madoc. Madoc had purchased him, through an intermediary, from the Rulatuvani. The records indicated the magnate had wanted both a bodyguard and a datasecretary in one being, so he must have known about Amanuensis' defensive abilities... So might Ratt, then.\nOne day, while datarambling, Bobby remembered the public bulletin board, and the message he had written for Ranavalona. He accessed the BBS, and with his reestablished root-account, he looked for all the messages to and from Terrinforma personnel.\nHe found one addressed to him!... It was from Capt. Brickbender.\n\"Sorry to hear of your enslavement. DO\/3D Ranalova has been restored to her former position aboard the Terrinforma. She briefed me about your troubles. Please feel free to visit my ship anytime we dock at Arcade, if you are able to do so. \/S\/ Harold Brickbender, Master.\"\nCapt. Brickbender was telling him, circumspectly, that he was welcome to smuggle himself aboard the Terrinforma if he could escape from his Arcade owner. Bobby was elated. He immediately checked the list of stopover ships for the Terrinforma... He couldn't believe what he found.\nThe dataship was docked at Arcade, now, for a few days of crew R&R.\nHe yelled, \"What outrageous luck!... Manny, I've found a way for us to escape from Arcade.\"\nThe android refrained from answering. He was standing in the corner. Since Bobby's initial jocular order to him in Kandu's workroom, he regularly took up a position there. Perhaps he felt \"comfortable\" in such an out-of-the-way place... But he had a good reason for his current silence.\n\"Too bad you won't be able to use it!\"\nBobby turned in his chair at the sound of the familiar squeaky voice. Ratt was pointing a radpistol at him. He'd entered this room from the Chapel's miniauditorium.\n\"I've been monitoring your datajacking for some time, Crawley.\" (Actually, the detective had only just recalled his remark about Reverend Davey, and had rushed 'round to the Full Gospel Chapel to see if the two escapees might really be there.)\nRatt advanced toward Bobby, buoyed with success. \"Your illegal skills have improved. You somehow avoided the alarm-applets I had attached to certain records... I'll be asking a lot of money for you.\"\n\"Thanks so very much, Detective,\" snarled Bobby. Then, he sought to distract Ratt. \"I was just examining your personal records. You've been a naughty fellow.\"\nIt worked. Ratt put his pistol to Bobby's head and bent to the screen. \"What're you up to now, Crawley?\"\nHe never heard Amanuensis approach from behind.\n\"Ow!\" Ratt shrieked as his arm was whacked in a sensitive spot, and the pistol was snatched from his paralyzed hand. He tried to turn and face his attacker, but didn't quite make it. The 'droid quickly immobilized the little Quartorian with one arm, and silenced him with the hand of the other.\n\"Gee, Ratt, you sure look funny with your legs dangling like that,\" joked Bobby with satisfaction.\n\"Bobby! What's going on, here!\" Reverend Davey had arrived to find the infamous Detective Ratt being manhandled in his Chapel.\n\"We're about to ship some cargo, Rev... Would you happen to have a big box handy?\"\nBobby watched as the shipping container was loaded into the cargo bay of the dataship Terrinforma. It contained two live individuals: Amanuensis and Detective Ratt - the former in control of the latter. The container was not examined by Arcade customs. Bobby had created official records validating a transfer of food, computer components, and Web antiques from Arcade to the dataship. Everything was in order.\nReverend Davey had been persuaded to allow Ratt to be boxed - after Bobby reminded him of his own complicity in their escape - and of the consequences he might suffer if Ratt were released... One of Davey's reformed delinquents who worked in the station's warehouse provided the cargo container.\nBobby was in the uniform of a crewmember, now. It was a new copy of his old uniform. He'd returned to being DO\/3d Eldon Roath - his old pseudonym - and to his old position of Data Organizer, Third Class.\nCapt. Brickbender had brought the uniform to him at the Full Gospel Chapel. Bobby had altered the official file of visitor records in the central computer to indicate that DO\/3d Roath had alighted from the Terrinforma with the other funseeking crewmembers. When he slipped into a party of returning crew, Visitor Control allowed Bobby to enter the ship with his crewmates.\nHis reunion with Ranny was joyous... She took him to the Captain's readyroom to report to Brickbender about the \"shipment.\"\n\"Cargo loaded, Cap'n,\" he reported.\n\"Good. I hope they're still alive.\"\n\"Ratt is well-packed, and Amanuensis can lie doggo 'til doomsday.\"\n\"I'll open the container after we're well away from Arcade,\" said the master of the Terrinforma. \"We'll drop-off the Quartorian on Minas Gerais, a mining colony where he can find out what slavery is really like... But what am I supposed to do with the android?\"\n\"He'll serve you well, Cap'n... You see, he has a very-large data storage capacity. That's why he's so big. You can upload your most valuable Web data into his storage, so when datapirates board the ship, you won't lose so much. He can pose as a cargomover 'droid.\"\n\"Why, thank you Roath. We can sure use him.\"\nThe Captain was impressed with Bobby's resourcefulness. He keyed the ship's intercomm. \"Chief, open that box we loaded on Arcade, and bring the 'droid up to my readyroom... Put the other guy in the brig.\"\n\"Now, Roath, tell me what happened to you after you were taken from my ship by Morganski's pirates.\n\"Wow. It's a long story, Cap'n.\"\nAmanuensis stood before Brickbender and his younger master.\n\"Manny, demonstrate your Web storage capability for the Captain.\"\n\"Aye, sir,\" he replied like a good crewman. Then, he unzipped his jacket and shirt and spread them to reveal his chest-screen.\n\"Great nebula!\" exclaimed Brickbender. \"He has a display, too!\"\n\"Aye, Cap'n,\" the 'droid replied... On the screen flashed the intro page of a classic SFF&H ezine - the one Bobby had mentioned wanting when they were in Kandu's antique shop.\n\"Manny! You stole that 'tique from Kandu's!\" Bobby gestured his innocence at Brickbender. The Captain smiled.\n\"I merely copied the datacard, then replaced it in its case while Kandu slept, sir.\"\n\"I see... Thanks, Manny.\"\n\"And, sir, no amputation was required.\"\n\"Amputation?\" inquired Brickbender of Bobby.\n\"I'll have to explain that, Cap'n.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He thought silently.\nBut he still felt the adrenaline pumping throughout his body like a runaway starcruiser as the alien laughter, mixed with raucous yells, filled the large room around him. His gray eyes again surveyed his new surroundings. Straightening up to his six foot frame, he brushed his fingers through his dark hair. Closing his eyes, he tried to clear his mind.\nBut as he opened them they were again drawn to the prisoner.\nHe was a hairy alien, slightly smaller than a human, while generally humanoid in shape. The face reminded him of a rodent, though the large leather-like ears took something away from that picture. The tail was obviously prehensile, curling up just behind the furry head. Though trapped in the tiny prison that floated above one end of the bar, he stood erect with a quiet dignity. As he swayed slightly with fatigue, he would suddenly jerk his body back upright.

As the tired alien again swayed, this time too far to one side, the harsh sound and flashing arcs of light announced the sudden pain that had been inflicted.\nSomeone wanted him to die; slow and painful.\n'A Staeurian', Chase thought, though he had never seen one in person. 'Must do a lot of climbing on its home world. He was going to have to look the species up in his ship's computers when he got back later. Adding another alien species to the growing list in his personal database'. Chase slowly shook his head before he took another drink. Could be he deserved his fate, though he would not have wished it on his worst enemy, and there were plenty of them right now. He brought his thoughts back to the here and now.\nThe bar was larger than most, and it was packed with vicious low lifes from all over this quadrant of the galaxy. Something flew through the half-lit air to crash against the head of a Nerillian. Purplish blood began to stream down his wide jowls as the large bulk of the Nerillian quickly rose to his feet and chased down the drunken alien on the other end of the toss. As they became, momentarily, the center of attention for everyone else, Chase surveyed the prize that he had travelled so far to obtain.\nAbove the back of the long bar, seemingly unprotected as it floated in the air, was the Gaspierr Ruby. Bigger than a man's fist and cut in shape close to an Earth Marquis, the light glimmered seductively off of its red surfaces. The centerpiece of the crown jewels for the House of Gaspierr, somehow it had found its way to this sink hole in space.\nBut then the galaxy was a big place. And like any wide open frontier, with the arm of the law far away, there would always be those who would make their own. Pirates, smugglers and thieves have existed on every inhabited planet since the beginning of time.\nHow much easier for them to work in the wide open regions of the galaxy.\nAlzacabar was home planet to such in this quadrant. And it had as much of a shady past as its denizens. It was not to be found on the main Galactic database. Of course it was mentioned on the navigational ones, but if you went by the official description, Alzacabar had nothing to offer. Hell itself would have been a better place to visit.\nYet there was a small thriving population. On second thought, seeing the type of aliens that based their fast starships here, there could be more than one way of interpreting that statement.\n\"Hello, Chase. I got the software preload finished. We're ready for tomorrow.\" Lydia said, playing her part for any aliens close enough to overhear.\nThe sultry voice belonged to his newfound partner. The warmth of her arm brushed against his as she stood close to him. She wore her auburn hair down tonight, the long strands curling down to her shoulders. Her beautiful smile seemed out of place.\nChase's pulse quickened at her nearness as she ordered a drink. But he would have to keep this professional for a couple of more days. Then maybe...\nAn uneasy feeling came over him which he immediately shook it off. Normally Chase hand-picked his crew. But not this time. Lydia had been chosen by someone very close to The Gaspierr, the original owner of the ruby, so he had never met her before the start of the mission ten days before. And with both of them training and preparing for this little escapade, there had been little time for chit-chat.\nShe was competent enough, Chase had discerned that from their preplanning counsels. And she was experienced, though they both kept their past out of the conversations. It worked better that way.\nBut Chase felt uneasy. He couldn't really place it, though he attributed it to how they were thrown together.\nAnd there was the other, obvious, reason. She was a woman.\nChase secretly laughed at himself. With all of his expertise in alien cultures, their ways, their motives, etcetera, his one failure had been with his own kind. He had never enjoyed a long term relationship with a woman.\n'Perhaps he tried too hard', he mused?\nLydia took the drink the bartender brought her. She tipped the glass his way and then drank deeply.\nChase felt they had worked well together so far. He had even sported thoughts of the two of them together in less work-like situations.\n\"Enjoying yourself Lydia?\" He asked with a wry smile.\nArching an eyebrow, she spoke in low tones.\n\"Yes, quite an interesting place. A friendly security officer bought me a drink earlier.\"\nThey smiled at each other. A few tables away a fight broke out as aliens scrambled away from the combatants. The sharp noise of a blaster settled it quickly.\n\"Friendly was he?\" Chase asked.\n\"Mahvahs are known to have a weakness for Earth women. He was true to his kind. He's even invited me over to his place for a private drink,\" she said in mock surprise.\nChase looked into her emerald eyes. This was a good break.\n\"Can you handle it?\" He whispered, trying to keep his concern hidden.\nShe laughed. \"No problem.\"\nThe sensual smell of her perfume caused him to pause before speaking. And then her face was close. Without any warning, she kissed him. Sweet and lingering.\n'I could learn to like this', he thought.\nShe placed her forefinger on his mouth before he could say anything else. And then she left.\n'So much for keeping it professional', he sighed inwardly.\nHe watched with a smile as she made her way between a group of Gargarians.\nChase almost spilled his drink as a small, high pitched voice interrupted his racing thoughts.\nA tiny alien about two feet tall, slender with a silvery glow, climbed up the seat to finish its drink next to him.\nHe didn't know what the alien was, but he wished it would go away.\nThen again, he was waiting for their 'inside' contact that would assist them. Chase waited for the 'line' to see if this pip-squeak could be it.\n\"Do you like humor, human? He chuckled with a sly smile of his thin, silver lips.\nChase grunted, turning away.\nIt wasn't the contact line.\n\"Now, now, its only a little joke. Hear it out.\"\n\"I'm not in the mood for humor.\"\n\"Come on, you'll like it.\"\nWith a sigh Chase turned back. He hated friendly drunks.\n\"Now then,\" the silver alien smiled widely. \"How many humans does it take...\"\nChase backhanded the alien ingrate before another word came out, launching it about fifteen feet across the room.\nAnd then it felt like a rock had gripped his shoulder from the rear.\nTwisting his head, he noticed the large clawed hand now attached with his shoulder. And then he was forcibly wrenched around to face the claw's owner.\nChase tensed.\nThe large snout opened wide, revealing the nasty fangs of a Nerillian. The beady red eyes were alight with anger.\n\"That's my little friend you just slapped, human!\" The last word was growled with drunken contempt.\nChase's mind raced. He knew he had been set up instantly. For what reason he couldn't discern. Huge muscles rippled under the stout alien's shirt. The two huge nostrils on the flat snout opened wide as the alien's other arm reached back to strike. And then his memory served up one of this alien's weakness' in hand-to-hand combat.\nChase spit directly into the right nostril. The alien screamed in pain as Chase then slammed his fist into the snout. The leathery skin gave under his blow. But the grip on his shoulder only got tighter as the clawed fist flew Chase's way.\nThe alien's blow dazed him, but the grip on his shoulder lessened enough to allow him to jump down off of his stool. Weaving slightly, he warily faced his antagonist. Chase noted with satisfaction that the Nerillian weaved himself as he went into a battle stance.\nIt charged him.\nSide-stepping and avoiding the huge fist, Chase twisted and kicked. But the Nerillian's stout body was as solid as it looked. It didn't even grunt from the blow. But the alien glanced at Chase's legs with newfound respect. Roaring, it charged again.\nChase felt the fist pound his ribs as the alien slammed him against the bar. Another blow quickly followed, sending a sharp pain throughout his body. As he struggled to get out of its grasp, the bleeding snout appeared right in front of him. Raising his head, he headbutted with all his might.\nThe alien screamed this time.\nClutching the bruised and bleeding snout, the red eyes seemed to glow at him. Again it went into a battle stance, and then charged. Murder was in its eyes. If it pinned Chase again, that would be the end.\nFaking a blow with his fist to the Nerillian's midriff, the alien responded by lowering both its fisted claws. Quickly twisting around, Chase brought his leg around with a tremendous blow to its tender snout. The Nerillian went down with a crash.\nThe observing alien faces returned to their immediate surroundings, the fun temporarily over. Leaning shakily against the hard surface, he tried to breathe normally again.\n\"Not bad for a human. Not bad at all.\"\nChase turned to find a very large figure standing over him. The grinning teeth filled the laughing mouth of its owner. It started laughing harder.\nHe felt a little uneasy at not being able to place this species, but his open laughter offset that feeling. Other than that, Chase's first impression was that the creature was quite overweight.\n\"Bar tender! A Taillen whiskey for me and the human!\"\nChase looked warily at the drink offered him from the heavy handed alien. For the first time he noticed the uniform. A pirate Captain no less. The glass was put under Chase's nose, the warm smell enticing. Shaking his head with an audible sigh to take the plunge, he grasped the small tumbler and downed the contents.\nWild and exotic lights filled his senses as Chase lost all concept of where he was. There was no longer a place, or any concept of time. It felt like he was floating... and then the moment faded back to better known sensations.\nA roaring laughter brought him completely back to reality.\n\"You humans make such faces! Oh ho-ho-ho,\" the heavy-set captain slapped a giant thigh as he bent over with laughter.\nChase brushed back his dark hair, and then shook his head, trying to clear it from the effects of the whiskey.\nEmptied of his humor, the large brown eyes of the alien captain came closer. Clearing his deep voice he said, \"I could use another good fighter on my ship. You may of heard of her,\" he smiled as he paused for effect, \"the Devourer. And I,\" he straightened up, putting an arm across his round chest, \"I am Captain Haigeg.\" The jovial deep voice had gone very serious on the official introduction, though a huge smile still graced his alien face.\nChase was still trying to clear his head. Pushing himself up, he finally stood on his own feet. Turning to the towering Captain he spoke shakily, \"No, afraid not. I'm not from around these parts.\"\n\"Yes, yeees. I know that. It's very obvious to see.\" The Captain looked around with a calculating eye. \"Why don't you join me over at my table. Maeei is there.\" As the Captain literally picked Chase up by his arm, they made their way into the middle of the crowded room.\nChase was able to finish the journey under his own power as the huge captain loosened his grip. Now that he could think again, he wondered what this unforeseen incident was going to cost him. He had a slim enough time frame as it was. Tomorrow night was the deadline. Why he did not know, he had gotten no answer from his clients. But tomorrow night it had to be done, and it seemed this captain was going to be as long winded as he was big. He felt his stomach turn as they approached the table.\nMaeei was an ugly one, about three hundred pounds of jiggling, spotted Aalvian flesh. She didn't smell too good either, Chase noted with a wrinkling of his nose.\n\"Isn't she beautiful!\nChase nodded as he smiled widely at the Captain's mistress.\nThe Captain leaned closer to Chase, \" You know,\" he whispered slyly, \" if you treat her right, she just might take a liking to a puny creature like yourself.\"\nChase swallowed.\nMaeei winked.\nGrasping the Captain by his collar, Chase pulled the big alien's ear closer and whispered sincerely, \"I'm afraid she might be a bit too much for me to handle.\"\nHaigeg laughed so loud that the empty glasses on the table danced around. The slap on Chase's back was almost as painful as his confrontation with the Nerillian.\n\"I like you human.\" And then to his female. \" My sweetness, leave us for a moment. We have business to discuss.\"\nShe puckered her huge lips and flapped a kiss his way.\nChase watched as the huge female pushed her large frame up. He also noted that she had sat upon two chairs.\nTaking a deep breath, Chase began plotting how he could untangle himself from this pirate and get back to the bar and meet his unknown accomplice. The half whispered words caused him to hold his breath momentarily.\n\"I understand the winters are pretty bad in Miami? No?\"\nHaigeg had spoken the code.\n\"Yeah, it can get up to your waist at times.\" Only someone very familiar with Earth would know that this was hogwash. And most aliens cared little about humans or their home world.\nHaigeg smiled as he raised his bushy eyebrows knowingly. He took a long pull from his glass and pushed another at Chase. He declined it.\n\"Taillen whiskey, good stuff. Grows hair on your throat, no?!\"\nChase rubbed his throat. He hoped this was just a jovial expression.\n\"I know, you want to know if my ship, if she is a good one. Come,\" the big Captain gestured broadly. \"You'll beg to join my crew after you see her.\"\nChase looked around the dimly lit room. \"Lydia is supposed to meet me here in about an hour...\"\n\"Yes, yes, I saw your woman. Kind of skinny human with reddish hair. Maeei will bring her, meet me over there.\" With that Haigeg got up and walked over to his mistress as Chase walked toward the entrance but stopped at the end of the long bar.\nAgain his eyes were drawn to the prisoner. The prisoner's jet black eyes stared back at him.\nWhat was he feeling?\nChase nodded at him. The prisoner nodded silently back.\nHaigeg's large frame moved beside him.\n\"What'd he do to deserve that,\" Chase asked as Haigeg followed his gaze up to the prisoner.\nLooking at the poor creature Haigeg spoke somberly, \"Treason I hear. I wasn't at the Council of Captains when he was sentenced, so I know not what the treason was.\" With that they stepped through the doors into the chilly night air.\nFifteen minutes later they were aboard the Devourer.\n\"I must apologize for the Nerillian.\"\nChase eyed the Captain as he sat at one of the terminals.\n\"I thought it might be a good way to meet discreetly. You humans draw attention just because you're so rare out here.\" Raising his arms he continued, \"And Nerillians are so easily provoked. I just mentioned how you humans detest them, and well...\" Shrugging, Haigeg stood beside him as a plan of the bar came up on one screen, while the security system came up on another.\n\"You must make it look like a real break-in. I don't want any suspicion my way. That's why I fly out of here tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Won't you be under suspicion by my coming aboard tonight?\"\n\"No, it's common to interview prospective crewers met at the bars. Especially ones that show prowess in battle. That was why I used the Nerillian. Of course you had to beat him first. But that was your little detail to work out.\" The jovial face smiled down at him. \"I had heard you were good in tight situations, Chase Broughton. So it seems you are,\" Haigeg said appreciatively\nChase nodded as he turned and studied first one terminal, then the other. He didn't notice the passage of time as he went deeper and deeper, screen after screen.\n\"Ah, company.\"\nHaigeg's words brought Chase out of his deep concentration. Lydia stood next to the Captain. The jiggling bulk of Maeei filled the rest of space behind them.\n\"How'd it go?\" Chase asked.\n\"Not as well as I'd liked. These security types are always so paranoid. By the way,\" she smiled, holding an empty vial. \"He'll have a real nice hangover tomorrow.\"\n\"Good. We won't need his information anyway, our contact here has all that we need.\"\nLydia seated herself and started studying the security system. Her fingers danced over the keyboard as her green eyes rapidly ran over the data.\n\"Very good system. All the latest,\" she said with awe in her voice.\n\"Has to be. The planet's full of thieves and pirates!\" Haigeg laughed.\nBut Chase saw the logic. Whatever kind of loose allegiance or organization they had here, it was obvious they didn't all trust one another. Security was pretty tight even here in the docking areas for the ships.\n\"Two days from now the ruby will go with a private collector.\" Haigeg's voice took on serious tone. \"These passwords will get you into the system tomorrow night. With this kind of clearance it will be easy to hack and crash the system for a few minutes, before the backup system takes over. That I can't help you with, only the most trusted know about that. Anyway, you should be able to put in a virus or something to cause problems. The defences around the ruby are another story.\" Looking at Chase he gritted his teeth. \"You will have twelve seconds to get the ruby once the system goes down initially. But the hardest part will be getting from the bar back to ship. The place is always full. That's one reason they keep it there. The other's because it's the best heist since the Gorist Treasure ship.\" He laughed out loud, \"Hey, we're proud of it.\"\nChase nodded and turned.\n\"Lydia, three basic things that I will need to get the ruby and get back in one piece.\" Lydia's green eyes fixed on him. Chase continued, \"First, their surveillance system, put it out of operation for at least fifteen, maybe twenty minutes.\" She nodded as she sat at console next to him and started typing. \"Second, at precisely the time I will set, the field around the ruby needs to come down. I will then have twelve seconds to retrieve it and put the fake in its place.\"\n\"The system will no doubt detect it is a fake!\" Haigeg said in a loud voice.\n\"Yes, though I hope they won't have the complete system back on-line right away. Anyway, the fake is for the eyes, I don't want anyone in the bar to notice its gone.\" Haigeg laughed. Chased turned back to Lydia. \"Third, and most important, after you crash the security system, you'll need to stay in the system fight their efforts to bring it back on-line until we're underway. I'll only communicate if I run into something unexpected.\" His voice became grave. \"Study their system like our lives depended on it. They do.\"\n\"Right.\" And then Lydia was intently studying the console as her fingers flew over the keyboard.\n\"Haigeg, what about this passage from underneath the kitchen back here,\" Chase pointed to a map, his finger at the end of a passage leading back to the docking area. It was one of many that criss-crossed underneath the main level. They were narrow with no climate control whatsoever.\n\"Underground, human. Nobody uses it but sanitation. And it's patrolled by a single YR-17 Attack Robot. The fast hover models,\" Hiageg's voice was deadly serious. Reaching up, he pointed to a side door out of the same kitchen at ground level. \"This might be a good way, security will be coming from over here. You'll have to get to this branch and head back before they cut you off.\"\nChase noticed that there were several places that led down to the lower level all along the path Haigeg pointed out. His gut feeling was to go down. But a YR-17. Tapping the keyboard, he brought up the file on the robot.\nIt was relatively small, its main body a sphere about three feet in diameter. Sticking out horizontally on both sides were twin rapid-fire blasters. Directly in front and behind were its visual sensors. They weren't going to sneak up on it! But, being a model designed for isolated duty, such as tunnels or underground retreats, it didn't have any motion sensors, though it did have heat sensors all around its equator. And it was heavily armored for such a small flying 'bot. It's only weakness was its service door, where it was turned off for maintenance. But how to get that close? The only weak points in its sensors were the areas directly below and above.\nChase shook his head and went over other avenues back to the ship. He knew the guards would be near-by, with all of the trouble brewing at the bar. Hmmm, he thought. He might use that potential powder keg to help him with the guards.\nThe Staeurian suddenly came into his mind.\n\"Lydia, I'm thinking we ought to free the Staeurian, maybe as a diversion. The more craziness the better at the bar.\"\nShe turned slowly, considering. When she spoke, her words were like weapons.\n\"Stupid idea.\" She said viciously. \"It'll bring the guards that much quicker. This is our only shot at the ruby. If you blow it, well...\"\nChase looked at her strangely, as if seeing her for the first time.\n\"Just make sure you keep your comm link on, the ruby and I will be coming to you.\" Chase's words were sharp in return. Their eyes fixed on each other as tension filled the air between them. And then she went back to work.\nShe was right about not bringing the guards too soon, but... Well, if he couldn't find a valid reason, the Staeurian would just have to die. Clenching his teeth he turned to the pirate Captain.\n\"OK. Haigeg, got some Earth coffee on board? We're going to be up awhile.\"\nThe alien snapped his fingers.\nThe hours dragged on. Chase memorized every exit, every possible way back to the ship. But, deep inside, he still felt the best way back was underground. But how to take out the robot. He had the tool to open the YR-17's access door, he had found it as part of his store of supplies, though this would be its first use. But how to get close enough? Ambush it from below? Chase felt tired. As he turned his tired eyes back to the security screens, his tired slouch suddenly straightened with interest.\nHe had found a heading on the prisoner, some kind of report. Chase smiled widely.\nPerhaps his gut feeling had been right all along...","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

In addition to the ruby, the bar contains a variety of fierce aliens and a Staeurian prisoner in a force field. Surviving an encounter with one of these aliens, Chase meets up with pirate captain Haigeg whose ship is to be used as a base of operations for the heist. Chase, Lydia and Heigeg discuss how they are to steal the gem, replace it with a fake, and bring down the security system before escaping.\nIf anything, the place was louder then the previous night. Music, loud and pulsating, pummeled his ears.\nGood. The atmosphere was right.\nHe had a blaster strapped to each hip. Across his back he carried the short military issue assault blaster. Quite illegal, but probably more at home here than in the Galactic fleet. He sauntered to the edge of the bar, ready for action.\nEarlier, Lydia had vehemently disagreed with him. She had noticed that all of his weapons were set to stun. Heavy stun, but stun nonetheless. Chase didn't like to kill. After all, he wasn't a pirate, he wasn't an assassin. He would do this his way.\nShe had laughed strangely as their argument ended.\n\"What'll it be, human?\" The seven foot feathered bartender asked.\n\"Ale, from Earth. Make it room temperature, too.\" Chase paused as the feathered being turned and punched in his order. He held a disc up as the alien turned around with his drink.\n\"What's this?\"\n\"Earth music, late twentieth century Rock & Roll! You see,\" Chase leaned closer, the weapon on his back shifted slightly, \"I'm going to rock this place tonight.\"\n\"We judge our music here by how many fights it starts. Any particular track?\"\nChase smiled widely as he glanced at his chronometer. Three more minutes till the security system went down.\n\"Track Nine.\" Chase took a long pull of the dark liquid.\nThe primeval throbbing of drums were at home here, but the roaring and screaming of electric guitars caused the multitude of conversations around the bar to stop. For many of them, the raunchy and powerful sound was new to their ears, or whatever else served them for aural input.\nThe lyrics, automatically translated into Standard, initiated appreciative nods and smiles. Others weren't so pleased as it became known, via the consoles on their tables, that this music was from Earth. Arguments predictably began, more than the usual outbursts. Of course in this kind of place, especially under the influence of alien whiskeys, it really wasn't that surprising.\nChase ducked as the lighting dimmed further. The guitars screamed on as blaster fire started to cut the air, and some of these blasts were not set on stun by the sound of them.\nMayhem and madness were what he needed tonight. It was being eagerly delivered.\nAnd then everything went completely dark as Lydia shut them down. Moments later the red emergency lighting took over, casting an eerie red glow over the proceedings that now got completely out of hand.\nChase had already leapt over the bar.\n\"Hey, you ca...\"\nRolling over, Chase quickly drew his right blaster and stunned the bartender down.\nHe turned around as the nearby crashing of glass caught his ear. Another bartender had drawn a weapon and was about to bring it to bear on him. Chase fired off two quick blasts, sending him crashing backwards unconscious. He looked up at the ruby, still floating in the air, surrounded by its invisible force field. He waited crouched behind the bar for the signal that Lydia had shut down it's protective field. The flash of the field dropping around the ruby almost made him jump.\nAnd jump he did as he half climbed the shelves behind the bar and leapt for the gem. As he landed on the floor, it was his.\nQuickly putting it in a pocket, he reached in another and pulled out a seeming twin, the decoy. Casting a calculating eye at the empty space above him, he gently launched the fake ruby into the air. The slow arch upward was suddenly stopped as the backup system took over. It was time to leave.\nEasing himself to eye level, Chase took in the red lighted room. Both exits were effectively blocked by fighting mobs as the music roared on unabated. And then new blasts lit the air around those two doorways as aliens fell. The rapid fire of assault blasters. But from the sound they were still set to stun, showing that the security guards still didn't have an idea what was happening.\nHopefully.\nA door crashed open down the bar from him as an armed alien, not a security guard, looked at him. Chase sent him down with a quick shot as a blast whipped over his own head. He quickly went to the door that led behind the bar. As he got there, he found himself face to face with the Staeurian.\n\"I set you free Staeurian.\" Chase said simply, punching the keys on the base. In his mind, Chase remembered the extra coding he had secretly slipped into Lydia's lines that would bring down the security system, which had also shut off the prisoner's field. \"You can come with me, or...\" he shrugged toward the melee beyond the bar.\nThe Staeurian nodded at Chase who unlatched his left blaster and handed it to him.\n\"It's on stun. Keep it there.\"\nAgain the alien nodded. And they were through the door.\nTwisting and turning, they both stunned some more workers as they made their way to the rear exit. But it wouldn't open. Lydia should have kept it open. Either her coding had been overridden, or...\nAssault blasts laced the walls around them as they jumped to either side. Chase holstered his blaster and pulled out his own weapon over his shoulder. Seven guards poured into the room firing as they ducked for cover. The Staeurian stunned one.\n\"Hey, \" Chase whispered loudly. \"There!\" He nodded at the sanitation dump station that led below ground. And then he stood, his automatic fire sending bottles, pots and pans flying as the Staeurian jumped through the swinging door.\nSeveral guards stood and returned fire. Chase stunned three with one deadly sweep of automatic fire which also sent the others back under cover. Reaching into his waist pocket, he pulled out a small round device. He knew from his research last night that most of the guards were Lynzz. Two of the three left conscious were such. Maybe the gas from this would do something to the other. Throwing it up into the air, it exploded, sending a vaporous gas streaming outwards.\nChase leapt into the same swinging door amidst the coughing and the tracers of automatic firing as more guards suddenly burst inside.\nHe was sliding at a steep angle as he tried to hold the assault rifle behind him. He didn't want anyone shooting down at him in this position. This was probably more for laundry than food disposal he realized as he suddenly slammed through another swinging door and landed in a pile of soiled linens. It was surprisingly quiet down here.\nThe Staeurian was holding the blaster on him.\n\"Which way now?\", he asked with a strange accent.\n\"This way to the fourth hallway, then right, go two more, right again and up at the next one. I've got a small hovercraft parked up there that will get us to my ship,\" Chase said hurriedly as he got to his feet. Looking back at the still swinging door, he could not hear any signs of pursuit for the moment. And then he pulled the S-comp from his waist. Quickly punching it's keys, Chase's brow furrowed with concern.\n\"But there is a YR-17 on its way to stop us.\" Flipping off the unit, Chase looked at his new companion. \"And it knows we are here.\"\nThey ran quickly down and made the first turn. The Staeurian glanced quickly back as he spoke.\n\"It is almost impossible to stop a YR-17 with the weapons we have.\"\nChase smiled knowingly at his companion as he ran.\nHe stopped suddenly as the faint glow of a force field caught his eye. They were trapped.\nLooking around hurriedly, Chase grabbed at his communicator as he whispered loudly into it.\n\"Lydia! I've got a problem.\"\n\"Go ahead, what is it,\" her voice answered.\n\"There's a force field stopping us, underground level, corridor twelve in sector B3. Get rid of it!\"\n\"OK, OK, I'm working on it.\" And the comm link went out.\nChase again pulled the S-comp from his belt. The YR-17 was moving fast. Lydia wouldn't be quick enough. Clicking the short assault blaster to full power, he handed it to his furry companion.\n\"We don't stand a chance unless we can get past this. There's a place where we can fight it, but this is not it.\"\nThe coal black eyes gazed back at Chase as it exchanged weapons with him.\n\"Then our lives depend on your friend.\"\nBut Chase's mind was racing, going over the weapons he had on his person. Everything else was for the guards, in case... and then he was moving back toward the hallway they had just left, as his hand pulled out a small round object. It was another chemical bomb, but for Alesas. When it went off the thick, black fumes would put them out. Maybe, just maybe, it would disorient the robot's visuals.\nAs he reached the doorway, he carefully looked around the corner, and saw it.\nIt was silently flying down the middle of the corridor, the red visual sensor glowing ominously toward him. The twin blasters spat death as he ducked back, chewing huge chunks of the wall onto the floor at his feet. Setting the round weapon live, Chase counted.\n\"One thousand, two thousand.\"\nHe threw the bomb around the corner and brought his arm back as more chunks of the wall spewed away from the robot's blasters. The explosion came quickly and thick black fumes shot past the doorway and around Chase as he ran back to the barrier.\nIt was still there.\n\"Lydia. Now! Do it now!\" He barked into the comm unit.\nAnd the glow of the force field stopped.\n\"Go!\"\nBoth Chase and the Staeurian were through.\n\"Turn it back on!\" That should slow it a moment, Chase thought, until the robot sorted through the virus filled security network and reopened it.\nLooking around briefly, the entrance was still filled with the black acrid fumes. But the YR-17 had not made the turn yet. They made the last right turn and ran to within ten feet of the outer door. Almost out, though Chase knew it would take a few moments for him to get past the electronic combinations that locked it. Too many moments.\nLooking up, he knew this was the spot for their battle. A utility shaft went several levels above them at this spot. Chase spoke hurriedly to the Staeurian.\nTaking the small tool, the alien's furry face cast a very doubtful look at him.\n\"You are sure of this?\"\nAn alarm went off on the device on Chase's belt.\n\"It's our only shot. Go! It's almost here.\"\nBacking against some thick pipes that ran up the side of the shaft, they barely covered Chases's body. The alien leaped and climbed easily, grabbing with both his tail and hands as he braced himself above, the tool held in his mouth.\nShrinking behind the large pipes that ran upwards, Chase waited, his finger on the miniature holographic projector on his belt.\nAfter it had briefly retreated from the bomb and smoke screen that had blinded its sensors momentarily, the YR-17 was moving steadily down the corridor. Its visuals showed no intruders, and its heat sensors showed only heat from the piping systems that ran up the maintenance shaft. The computer stopped just short of the shaft, its electronic brain racing through the possibilities.\nAnd then its visuals picked up a human running from behind the pipes toward the outer door. Instantly its twin blasters roared, sending chunks out of the wall as it followed the running human. The electronic brain raced with a kind of confusion. Its visuals showed that it had hit the human with a ninety-seven percent ratio of hits, yet the human ran unhindered. Also its heat sensors had not registered...and then its visuals picked up movement near the pipes again. Slowly, the unit moved forward, concentrating its resources forward.\nIf the YR-17 could have registered surprise, it would have, as the unseen Staeurian landed squarely on it, sending it hard to the ground. The twin blasters erupted with fury.\nAnd then it was off at high speed.\nChase hadn't counted on that. The computer's profile had indicated that the grav-motors were not strong enough to fly with that much extra weight. But there it went, with the Staeurian hanging on for dear life, hanging on with both hands and feet wrapped around the twin arms that held the blasters. Even its tail was wrapped tight.\nAs the YR-17 picked up speed, it started to spin completely around, causing its rider to shift and change it's precarious hold. And then it was heading for a wall, apparently off-balance. Quickly the Staeurian shifted away, to keep from being banged off it's angry mount. And again the small robot spun him around, just barely missing first the right, and then the left wall.\nIt was a wild ride.\nRight at the very end of the corridor they stopped suddenly, and with a burst of high speed energy, the YR-17 began to spin furiously in that one spot. As Chase watched, the metallic ball and rider became almost a blur. But still he held on. As suddenly as the spinning started, it stopped, as the robot floated and wavered.\nIt turned and began coming back, but now in its straight arrow flight it slowly sank towards the floor.\nThe sound of steel skidding against concrete announced that the rider had ridden it down. Only for a moment. As the blasters erupted now into an endless stream, sending showers of rubble all around, the drunken duo headed back towards Chase.\nEvading the blaster fire coming towards him, Chase turned the corner that led to the door. He felt his heart stop as he realized he would never open it before the robot cornered him. He would have to try and jump on the robot as well, bring it down if they could, and open that access door to put it in maintenance mode. He didn't like the odds. But it was the only plan he had. He waited as the blaster fire came closer.\nAnd then the blaster fire eating up the wall to his left abruptly stopped, just as he expected them to round the corner. Still he didn't move. Without warning the Staeurian sauntered calmly around the corner.\n\"Let's go, human.\"\nChase managed a smile.\n\"How'd you get the door open, hanging on so hard?\"\nThe prehensile tail whipped from side to side.\n\"First I opened the access door. Then I got the tool out of mouth, after it stopped bucking and came straight at you. I inserted and turned, just like you said.\" Laughing, he flipped his tail and sent the small tool into Chase's quickly opened hand. \"Except I did it with my tail. It was easier that way.\"\nA few minutes later and they were outside and speeding towards the ship. At the docking bay all was quiet, Lydia's diversion of sending out a false report of his whereabouts had worked.\nAs they ran into the ship, the doors had barely closed as she lifted off, turned the ship ninety degrees, and sped toward the stars. Two small fighters picked her up on their screens and gave pursuit.\n\"Can you outrun them?\" The Staeurian said, out of breath.\n\"I've got oversized engines in her. Both ThunderStar. We'll blow'em easy ,\" Chase said with confidence.\nAs they streaked over the housetops, the Lightning gained momentum as her engines roared to full speed. Her two wings spread out in an almost triangular fashion when viewed from above or below. About a third of the way from the blunt nose , peering out the glass view port that wrapped around the thickest part of the ship, Chase and his two companions watched the azure sky quickly turn to the black of space.\n\"Hands in the air, and don't make any sudden moves!\"\nChase looked at the blaster leveled at him. And then he looked at the stern green eyes.\n\"Turn around, both of you. Slowly,\" Lydia ordered.\nChase's mind raced, but he had no answer for this. She had been picked by Gaspierr himself, so he had trusted her from that. Turning to the black eyed alien next to him he spoke, his voice edged with disgust.\n\"Never trust Earth women.\"\n\"SHUT UP!\" Lydia ordered.\nA single pair of binders were slung at their feet. Lydia continued, \"Put them on the alien, hands behind the back. Then you get real still while I put yours on. Any moves and I nail you, and my blaster isn't set to stun.\"\nChase did as he was told. As he stood behind the fur covered being, the tail dropped quietly to the floor as Chase put the binders on with a snap. Stepping just to the left of the Staeurian, he put his hands behind his back for his bracelets.\n\"If you're doing this for yourself, you won't get far. Not many people can afford...\"\nHe felt the blaster grind against the back of his head.\n\"No, not for me. Remember the private collector due here tomorrow. Well, he plays both sides of the fence, to get the best deal. On one side of the fence is the House of Gaspierr. His contacts at the Royal House informed him of this little escapade. He saw a way of maybe getting the ruby at the best price. FREE!\"\nChase snarled at her laughter. And then the binders snapped together. He looked over at his fellow prisoner. Ever so slightly, he nodded at Lydia.\n\"You know, Lydia, you won't be able fly this ship without me. You'll..\"\n\"I've already overridden your petty defense programs. I'll fly it easily, now move it!\"\nShe pushed against his back with her free hand as she waved the blaster at the alien to get him to move. The tail moved with a blurring motion.\nIn an instant it wrapped around her hand and forced the blaster loose. As she stumbled back grabbing her bruised wrist, she faced the barrel of the blaster pointing at her.\n\"I hope your tail isn't trigger happy, for Lydia's sake,\" Chase chuckled.\nTwo days out and all signs of pursuit by the three pirate corsairs were no more. The corsairs had picked them up as they left the planet. But ,though fast, they had been no match for the Lightning's speed. Aaff, the Staeurian, turned to Chase.\n\"Why did you set me free back there. I could have been anybody?\"\nChase smiled.\n\"It was part instinct. The other part was I found out from the pirate's security files that you were a Yizing government spy that had infiltrated one of their crews, trying to put an end to their hijackings in this quadrant. Besides, Staeurians are quite a noble race from what I've researched, not too many go in for pirating.\" And then Chase sighed.\nAaff twisted his head as he studied the quiet human before he spoke. \"Why so down-hearted? We have escaped... we have the ruby?\"\nLooking back to the prisoners room, he spoke with a melancholy air.\n\"It seems with all my planning, all my research, I still can't figure out my own kind. Who I can trust, or if I can. I was even planning on...\" Crossing his arms, Chase stood for a moment silent. He finally turned with a wry smile. \"I have an especially hard time figuring out the opposite sex.\"\nAaff's furry mouth curled in a smile. \"We have a saying among my people.\" Spreading his arms wide, he continued, \"The ways of love are like the ways of the stars.\"\nChase looked at him questioningly.\n\"And what does that mean?\"\nAaff's large smile revealed rows of pointed teeth. \"The males usually discuss it's meaning over drinks.\"\nChase leaned back in the pilots chair, \"I can relate to that. But I have one request.\" Casting a knowing look, he said,\n\"Anything but Taillen whiskey...\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Out of his bathroom window he miraculously squeezed his 200 pound frame and dropped to the grass below his apartment. Only a two story fall, Barry had made the jump without breaking any bones and then frantically darted up the slanted street in his black trench coat hoping he had been quiet enough not to have awakened the attention of the crowd forming outside of his apartment door. Any one seeing him run up this steep hill in the fog would think he were a San Francisco ghost running away from a crime in his heart.\nLooking back at his followers who surrounded his life and kept vigil at his apartment day and night, Barry knew that he had finally escaped the line of people who demanded to be touched by him, the block long snake waiting to eat him alive.\n\"My God! When will they ever get a clue and find a real Messiah?\" Barry panted as he finally made it to the top of the hill. By instinct he could feel the sea stretched out from the bay even though Barry couldn't see it through the fog. The ocean breeze comforted him as he stood alone, unclear where to go or who to turn to now that he was free from the grips of his confined life. He pulled his trench coat closer to his naked body and rushed forward, anxious to find a dark corner to hide in the shadows of the early morning before anyone on the street spotted him and sideswiped his attempt at desertion.\nBut it was too late in the morning to expect that the true commuter pedestrians of San Francisco would stay indoors on this day just because Barry needed his solitude. His life just didn't work that way. People appeared transparent through the fog, rushing past him to jobs and responsibilities. Once, a couple of years back, Barry had been one of these strangers he saw scurrying past his shadow. But now his life moved against the foot traffic, against this bustle of the city. instead, Barry ducked and hid in alleyways and took cover in closed the depth of closed store fronts, away from the chance glance of a curious onlooker who might be looking for an unusual sight to liven up this Monday morning drudgery.\nToo concerned for his own safety and nestled in the comfort of the fog, Barry did not see the man in front of him rollerblading down the hill at the same moment Barry stood on the sidewalk, deciding which direction to take.\n\"Hey, man! Watch it!\" The well-built man's flight soon ended as Barry and he collided. The rollerblader flew a few feet in the air and fell to the pavement. \"Jesus Christ. What the hell are you doing, you jerk? You got right in my way!\" Seeing the man spilled on the concrete ground scared Barry. He wanted to help the man but instead looked to ground and pulled his blue snow cap lower on his head. With skates twisted into angry angles, the man sat on the pavement, bleeding from his elbows and knees. He examined his ankles; he gripped his thighs and threw his head back in agony as he struggled to bend his skinned joints.\nBarry struggled with his instinct to bring this man back to balance while he moved closer to the victim bleeding on the pavement. \"Hey, look. I'm really sorry.\"\nStruggling to rise up from the concrete on his own without Barry's help created more anger in the man. \"At least you could give me a hand.\"\nInstead of giving in to the man's wish, Barry backed away from this potentially dangerous scene and fastened every button on his trench coat. Hide as much of me as I can. Maybe he won't notice, Barry thought, struggling with his impulse to rescue the man from his pain.\nTurning to run off and continue on his way, Barry was caught by the steady anger in the man's voice. \"Where you going so quick? Bastard like you think you own these damn streets. Just spill a man and run, you stupid freak.\" The man bent his body forward and sat on his knees. With full force and will power, the man rose up like a giant. Composure regained, this towering Cyclops searched through the fog for the nobody who had blinded his eye sight.\n\"I was... uh... just... uh....\" Barry stumbled with his words, afraid to further anger this man who could so easily squash Barry like a bug. Becoming uncomfortable with the rock hard stare the man gave him, Barry reached for the hood of his trench coat and put it over his head, bracing himself for the inevitable confrontation since the man moved closer into Barry's space.\n\"I was just taking a walk,\" Barry mumbled, his eyes darting to all sides of this stranger. Just get away quick, now. Run straight into him if you have to.\n\"Hey, I know you....\" The gravity of the hill interrupted the man, and the wind sought to drive him down to the pavement again. But he held his stance battling the pull with every expletive he knew. Now balanced on the street for the second time, the man came back to focus on the man in front of him and looked Barry full in the face, eyes widening in obvious acknowledgment. \"Jesus Christ, it's you. I can't believe it. I was just on my way to see you,\" the man blurted out like a nuclear factory horn warning of danger on the job. He automatically reached for Barry's hand. But no such luck with Barry. He never shook hands with strangers he knew nothing about. Knowing so little bit about their past and their present health made their ritualistic greeting a danger.\n\"Nice meeting you. I was just on my way. Gotta go,\" Barry managed to say before the man reached out and grabbed the sleeve of Barry's coat.\n\"Look, I'm sorry. I know how busy you are, but you've gotta help me. It's my father. He's killing me. He's too much for me to hold inside. It's destroying my family.\" The man pulled and shook and clung desperately to Barry.\n\"Help me. You are the only one who can. The newspaper's all say you can cure any evil on this planet. If that's true, then I'm a definite candidate for healing.\" The man struggled to keep Barry from running off while Barry tried to free himself from the tight hold. \"You are the Messiah, praise you! I will give you anything you want- my daughter, my BMW, my Victorian chateau in downtown- if you would just please take my violence away.\"\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't help you today. I've gotta go. I can't do this any more. This healing is just too much for one man.\" Barry pushed himself forward with all of his strength freeing himself from the man's grasp but leaving his trenchcoat behind. Stripped of his trench coat, Barry stood with only his striped boxers and white tank top to cover the body he wished to hide. For the condition of Barry's body, he might as well have been naked. He realized how hard hiding would be for him now that he stood out from the normal commuters rushing off to work. \"One hour to myself for one day is all I ask,\" he said to no one in particular as he ran up the hill, again on his way to nowhere in particular.\nAs Barry reached the top of the hill and turned into an alley, a crowd stood in a pack, blocking his escape, angry faces showing them to be witnesses to Barry's confrontation with the rollerblader.\n\"Hey! What's wrong with you? That man needs your help.\" The crowd moved closer to him, jeering at him, showing their disappointment at Barry's unwillingness to work his magic. \"Heal the ones you hurt.\" With the blader gaining speed from behind and the crowd pressing closer in front of him, Barry knew his opportunity to be alone today had blown away with the San Francisco wind, eaten away by the aggressive needs of the crowds that never stopped coming to see him.\n\"I just needed the day off. One day and then tomorrow I will be back to heal all of you.\" Barry stood, hands in pocket, eyes cast downward, caught in his followers' stares. Guilt racked his mind, What a selfish bastard I am. Can't even clean up my own messes. I can't stand to see that man's blood flow. For once Barry exposed his full body to the crowd that had only seen his media-fed heroic image on the front pages dressed in a purple sequined gown with the title of \"Superstar\" stitched on the back of his costume. Shivering, body tense, ready to run once the opportunity approached, Barry felt his pores open and his ink come alive as the wind continued its steady pace.\nBarry felt the points of the lightning bolts on his chest as they moved and swirled in the wind. He could hear the gasps in the crowd, comments about the skeletons rising up on his skin, seeming to stretch in the morning dawn, The tattoos were awakened by Barry's own adrenaline rush as the crowd circled around him. Never before had anyone seen Barry's flesh up close. Sometimes even Barry forgot that demons adorned every inch of flesh on his body. Every evil spirit that had ever been exorcised from his followers had planted themselves under Barry's skin, using him as their personal temple.\n\"My God! Look at them all!\" one of the followers gasped. The colors on Barry's flesh swirled with movement as Barry shrunk under the lasers of the people's stares.\nA man - six foot, pot-bellied, and a cigar sticking out of his lips - moved right into Barry's face and glared at him. \"Who said you could have the day off, freak? We didn't.\"\nWith this man's obvious dominance over Barry, the crowd's hungry mouths opened and begged for fulfilment. The crowd's voices were indistinguishable to Barry; the crowd was like one brain with the same desire.\n\"Heal us! Touch us! Take our demons away!\" they yelled in unison, the chant that normally sent Barry into a welcoming trance. But not today. Turning around, looking for a way out, Barry saw flailing arms in front of him, raised in the air in praise of their Messiah, beckoning him to save them, desperate for his healing touch, desperate for his magic to take their pain away. Nowhere to turn as more of his followers joined the crowd and blocked his path of escape. Closer they pushed towards the man who tried to fight their need for him until he had to kneel on the ground in front of them in beggar repose- the only space left for him to breathe. Some day I will escape all of this. Chanting mantras, dancing hands, snapping fingers calling on their heaven in the foggy sky, the crowd became lost in this rabid ritual.\n\"Help us!\"\n\"Give us relief.\"\n\"We need you.\"\n\"Touch us.\" The people begged, whined, pleaded.\nOne of the women in the crowd moved forward from the rest, unbuttoned her blouse, and revealed her chest to Barry's hands- colors swirling in multiple dimensions in his palms, attracted to her closeness- coaxing him to touch her heart as he had done for so many thousands in the city over the past year. \"Please heal me. I won't do you any harm. Set your spell on me.\"\nKnowing from past experience that he could not escape the crowd's aggressive nature when they were in the throes of passion like they were now, Barry tucked his hands between his legs and wrapped himself into a fetal position, letting the warriors on his skin protect him from this surging crowd. Axes raised, spears readied for bloodshed, Barry's demons raised themselves to the surface to protect this man they also saw as their savior.\nAs a last attempt, Barry yelled, \"Please, just go away. All of you.\" He tried to push the woman away. The woman instead saw the ink designs stretching up the full length of his arm and immediately breathed onto the face of one of the warriors.\n\"My God! Look at you. You are so beautiful.\" Her eyes travelled further down to Barry's legs, his calves, each individual toe, back up to his chest, his other arm, every fold of his flesh. \"Look at all of these faces, these demons you have captured in your skin. How beautiful their darkness is.\" She looked at Barry's face and wiped away his tears. \"Like silk you must feel. Let me feel you as you are, sweet one.\" She reached out to touch Barry's tattooed body, \"Let me have some of your dark power, baby. Let me heal some of your wounds.\" She reached out for Barry as he recoiled, his voice begging her to give him the privacy he desired.\n\"Don't touch me. Please! Just leave me alone.\" As if they had heard an invitation rather than a rejection, the crowd as one creature reached out and stroked Barry's frame, felt his smoothness, felt its heat. Anonymous voices swept through Barry's buried ears.\n\"Yes... I can feel his magic in my veins.\"\n\"Oh yes, let my healing begin.\"\nViolently Barry's body shook with each caress. The tattooed images on his skin came alive as the crowd dug deeper into his silky flesh. Barry gave up the fight and curled himself into a tighter ball. The crowd continued to feel him, penetrate him with their need, and caress the heat of healing Barry offered like a sacrifice and at one time a gift to the citizens of San Francisco. Snarled, raptured beasts enjoyed the stroking of his skin as Barry lay still, no longer trying to control the direction of his life on this day. His consciousness fully retreated into his own fog, and the crowd was left to dance with the images tattooed on the flesh before them. The tattooed warriors readied themselves for a fight and rose up in caution at the crowd's aggressive but instead found themselves enjoying the faithful crowd's touch of admiration.\n\"My god, they are still alive within him, all those evil spirits taken from others just like us.\" The woman, bare breasted, deeply breathing, reached inside Barry's white cotton tank top and felt the dominant tattoo on his chest- the two-headed skeleton with a dead woman strangled in his fist.\n\"Oh, I like this one,\" she cooed. The tattoo swayed with her touch, and she quickly ripped Barry's shirt from his body to better feel the tat's full effect from her touch. The demon's spine arched, ready to pounce on her, ready to take his next victim. \"Amazing,\" she uttered as she pulled Barry's boxers to his knees. The creature's body extended down below the Messiah's waistline, covering the man's privates and backside. Amassed in barbed wire and dripping of blood, the tattoo was becoming fully fleshed at this woman's provocative touch. I've got another fist to clench you in, this demon sneered through Barry's mind, ready to leap on this woman he saw as his prey. The woman reached out to Barry's penis, hoping to get a rise out of the savior, but saw the tattoo she had been playing with quickly losing its three-dimensional shape.\n\"Ah, man. He's getting cold,\" the woman sighed, seeing the demon retreat back into its line form. \"He probably fainted or something.\" The crowd stopped probing Barry's lifeless body and rose up to move on its way.\n\"Where's the heat, now?\"\n\"Damned burned out, Messiah.\"\n\"He's no good to us now. He's cold as stone.\"\n\"Let's get out of here.\"\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" the woman, once so intrigued, buttoned up her blouse, sighed and spit on Barry's face, leaving him for dead in the middle of the foggy alley.\n\"Just when we were having some fun, he's gotta check out.\"\nWhile talking rapidly of the miracle of healing they had felt through their bodies, the crowd moved on to the local park where a beating could occur, a purse snatching, or any form of excitement imaginable. They felt energized and alive, while Barry lay helpless in the streets, in the fog of his own coma, defenceless, ready for the taking by the next passerby to do what he wished to the city's Messiah.\nIn the fog of this busy morning, foot traffic scurried along, downhill, uphill, and most people did not have time to stop and wonder why a crumpled form lay in the alley, naked, writhing in pain. They saw the tattooed man seemingly dead in the street but this scene was nothing new to them. Most of the commuters had seen this type of scene before- maybe on a different street with a different victim, who might be conscious and begging for help. But work was work to the commuter moving on, not bothering to stop and call the police for the victim of the street. They kept their noses in their own business and cast their eyes to the ground while moving to the pace of the rhythm flowing through their headphones. Besides, the fog cast a spell over anyone who dared its thickness.\nMost of all, it was comforting to the citizens of San Francisco to know that not much was new in the city today.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Well, I did recently but before I speak of that, let me back up a minute and fill you in on some items.\n1) Find a weekend event.\nMost states have their own events. Obviously, if you can't find an event, you can't go, now can you? A web search, if you are on the Internet, will come up with some. Try searching under Adventure, Guild, Fantasy, Myth, and other like words or phrases. You should come up with several. I have a couple from people that I have met on the Web. Fantasy Quest and Mythical Journeys. They try not to schedule events on the same weekends because they are vying for the same people for the most part. Does the adventure game have its own Web pages? These are a good indication of what has been going on in the continuing history of the game.\n2) Send off for the rule book.\nThese will run you from 10 to 15 dollars. Also, arrange to get the newsletter at the same time. The rulebook should tell you everything you need to know about the events. History of the Realm, major races, system of combat, system of magic, how to build your character, how to build safe weapons (called boffers), how to handle anything that comes up. Believe me on this: reading the rulebook is not sufficient preparation for the real (?) thing.\n3) Ok - you have decided on which event you want to go to, they have a cool Web site, you've read the rulebook, now - you need to select your character and name -\nMost adventures have races like human, elf, Ork, dwarf, and others. The one I was at, Mythical Journeys (MJ for short) also had some specialized races: Ra'Kash - a feline race, Famori - an offshoot race from Ogre roots (the Famori got the looks and brains - the Orks, their cousins, got everything else), and Warg - a hybrid race - incredibly ugly - I never saw a female Warg - possibly there are none.\nThere are also the professions: fighter, mage, thief, cleric (which comes under mage in some systems), ranger, ninja, etc. There are also combination classes - fighter\/mage, mage\/thief - you get the idea.\nOk - you have decided who and what you want to be and you have come up with a really nifty name for yourself and you have given yourself some great abilities - now you look through the rulebook and find out - oops - those abilities are really expensive - especially for a new character. At MJ, a character starts with just 110 points which must be divided in such a way as to support your character, so, you start paring down your wish list of abilities. Does your character use a weapon? He\/she had better have some way of defending\/attacking!\nDoes your character use a shield? If the character can get by without one (especially a new character), don't bother.\nSpecial abilities - is your character a spell caster? Then he needs to be able to read! That's right - reading ability is not a given. If a thief, the character needs to be able to skulk unseen. Will you be handling poison? You need poison craft or you will poison yourself every time you handle it!\nCan your character use spells? Better get Mana (the ability to work spells) or you will have lots of nifty spells but not be able to use them.\nNow, send your proposed character history to the game-masters for review. If you e-mail it in, do not send your character history and profile as a separate text file. Not all machines can read all text files (mine got totally garbled in transmission). Send the entire text in the e-mail and not as an attached file.\nLet's see - you have your character generated, you know where and when the event is going to be - so it's time for:\n4) Making your costume.\nNow, this doesn't have to be really expensive but let's face it: the better it looks on your character and for the medieval period, the more expense! If you have someone else make it, this can mount up fast! Let's say you have access to a sewing machine and that you have some (minimal) skill. Fabric costs from 2 to 6 dollars per yard. I found out while pricing mine that a yard of fabric is not a yard wide by a yard long... no... it's a yard long by however wide the bolt of cloth is - usually 5 to 6 feet. That made the fabric prices easier to live with.\nGot a pattern in mind for your costume? Then you will just need appropriate colors and thicknesses. Buttons and zippers didn't exist (or don't exist - you figure it out). Closures are with ties - if the ties are going to be under a strain (like a bodice), brass grommets should be used and a thick enough fabric (or leather) so that they don't pull out. You are going to be falling down wounded or dead a lot, so use durable fabric.\nSeveral changes of costume are recommended.\nBoots are not a firm requirement but do not wear white tennis shoes - this jars the \"suspension of unbelief\" too greatly. No wristwatches or beepers and only wear costume jewelry.\nNow you need an appropriate weapon for your character. Two-handed sword, short sword, dagger, axe, club, staff... the rule book tells you how to make a safe weapon. The MJ rulebook, however, does not include pictures of what the typical weapon looks like, so you have to go with your imagination until your first event and see what others have come up with. If your character uses a crossbow - the NERF crossbow is acceptable. Until you have been to at least one event, I would not recommend using a bow and arrow as it is very difficult to make them safe. The bow must be very under-powered (range about 30 - 40 feet) with the arrow tips covered with a lot of foam rubber.\nNow we come to:\n5) Provisions!\nThere is, for the most part, no food or water at these events. You must bring everything with you. Nothing that needs refrigeration (unless you bring plenty of ice in a cooler). Some camps require no alcoholic beverages - you can be ejected if caught with any. Unless you bring a hibachi, don't bring anything that requires cooking. On the other hand, cheese, beef jerky, and hard salami gets tiring very fast. Bring treats to trade with the other players (Rice Krispy Squares are popular). A cooler with ice and soft drinks (to keep in your cabin) is recommended. A bota (one of those leather Spanish wine flasks) is also useful for carrying water or other potables around.\nIf you are handicapped, remember that these things take place in the woods. Not all areas are wheelchair accessible. If you have any physical condition that would make it hazardous to fall down or you have limited mobility, at MJ you wear a bright yellow arm-band - this warns everyone to take special care with their attacks. Other events will have similar signals. EMTs are on hand for emergencies.\nAlso lots of Scotchgard is recommended. These events are not called on account of rain. You take what comes and work around it. I forgot the Scotchgard. Your costume gets very heavy when wet.\nFinally, bring someone along! Two have much more fun than one. You can also share driving duties. Or even arrange for a group to go - that way you can have a lot of interaction otherwise impossible. Arrive in plenty of time. Extra game points are given for helping to set up and take down the camp-site. Also check in with the game-masters about what items you can bring to donate to the game for extra points and to improve everyone's enjoyment. These extra points can come in handy!","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

That was when I discovered that my character profile had not arrived. (The game-master, Eric, said that they had tried to get in touch with me but had been unable to.) So, with the help of one of the game proctors, we rebuilt my character. Since nothing else was working right, I became a half-elven thief. Fortisven Half-elven by name. It's real easy to come up with an Elven name: just pick a long word and add and\/or subtract vowels until it's unrecognizable. As I had no Elven ears (all Elven characters have to wear Spock ears), I wore a head-band covering my ears. (Sort of like Spock did in the Star Trek movie, The Voyage Home).\nWith the 110 points I was allowed, I chose: One-handed weapon, poison craft (the ability to work with poisons), apply poison (this lets me make a poison blade), waylay (useful for a thief), and avoid traps (self explanatory).\nMy sword was then inspected to make sure it was safe. After a minor alteration, it passed inspection. I did everything wrong that weekend but still had fun - I'll know better next time what to do and what to avoid.\nI, Fortisven Half-elven, came into Lowtown for lodging (the prices were lower than Hightown). I had heard rumors that I might find somewhere here the Amulet of Change that would allow me to control my were-wolf side. Fortunately, the moon was at new, so I needn't worry about changing yet. My money was almost gone, so I must needs 'liberate' a few pouches to increase my ready coin for bribes and information. A pity that I haven't had much practice what with living in the wildwood. I hid three of my coppers and took two with me as I had forgotten to bring a pouch for money. When I left my room, I was set upon by a pair of green-faced monsters, the like of which I had never seen. After defeating me (it didn't take long) they threw my battered and bleeding body into the bushes and went off in search of more prey.\nWhen I awoke, a Necromancer was lifting his hands from my body. He had raised my dead body as an Undead! I must obey my master, the Necromancer, and search out others to kill. He later met with a Succubus to complain about the dearth of bodies for his army. In disgust, perhaps because his army wasn't big enough for his purposes, he then slew me.\nAs a spirit (and nothing that happens as a spirit is remembered by a character), I went to Fate. Fate was annoyed because of all the spirits he (it?) was having to process. I was briefly instructed in how to approach Fate, told to choose four cards (face down - the first time I pulled it face up), and then told to choose one of the cards to settle my fate. (I am told other places do it differently.) My fate was to loose half of my armor - I wasn't wearing any - my Mana and life points were restored completely and no memory of events just prior to my \"death\". I was then dismissed to return to the living.\nI found that I had missed a battle in which the Necromancer was killed and the Succubus returned to the Void (both Non-player characters). So I went to the Silvermane Inn for an ale. No one had bothered to search my body and so I still had my two coppers with me.\nNothing appeared to be going on so I wandered around exploring. In Hightown, I found a Seer. I consulted with her about the Amulet but she knew nothing of it. She then read my future. She told me that, while I would confront many difficulties and trials, I would in the end achieve my goals. She didn't tell me everything she saw in the cards though. She appeared to be disturbed by something she saw there.\nAfter I left her, I went to the Temple of Baku but the priest wasn't there. I didn't attempt to rob the Temple. Something told me that it would be a very bad thing. I went over to the Mage's Guild Hall to look around. Several chests invitingly on the tale roused my suspicions. Using my (admittedly slight) talents, I opened one chest and narrowly avoided the poison needle that sprang out. The chest was empty. Not wishing to push my luck, I reset the trap, closed the chest, and quietly left.\nOn the way back to Lowtown, I decided to try my skills at waylay. I picked a likely looking Ra'Kash and attempted to knock him out. Unfortunately, he sensed the blow coming and dodged. Good thing he didn't get a good look at me. Continuing on to Lowtown, I decided to get a bite to eat. I saw movement in the shadows... the next thing I know, I'm leaving Fate again. I'm still hungry so I return to Lowtown. A Guardsman that I meet tells me to beware, there are strange lights in the wood. That's fine by me. About now, I'm getting angry enough to fight anything. I go down the path slowly, letting my eyes get accustomed to the dark. But I find nothing. For now, I eat and go to bed.\nMorning and I get up and take a trip to the communal showers. I was surprised at the level of the amenities. I was told that there were none! (While in the showers and until I got my costume on, I was out-of-game so that, officially, I didn't see the monsters creeping up on Lowtown - talk about a rude awakening. If you are in bed, you are fair game for monsters... you shouldn't be in bed that late anyway. They still hadn't attacked by the time I got back to the cabin, so all I could do was dress and urge my cabin-mates to get up. Alas, I finished dressing before anyone got up.) As I started out the door, I noticed movement out the window. Drawing my sword, I yelled a warning to my cabin-mates. I, of course, fell beneath the first rush, but as there were several Healers in the cabin, I wasn't too worried.\nSure enough, after a brief fight in which the monsters were driven off, I regained consciousness to see a Cleric's glowing hands leaving my (now healed) body. Taking two coppers from my fast diminishing stash, I headed for the Silvermane Inn.\nThere I found, to my delight, a supply of Black Potion (coffee) and sweetcakes (muffins). I noticed a game of chess in progress and wandered over to observe. The game was ending. I was asked if I played by the priest of Baku. (I never learned his name. Pity, that) As we played, one of the Inn's servitors came by, singing badly in a strange language. It was most annoying. It put my game right off! So I excused myself for a moment to get my sword from where I had left it by the pot of Black Potion, went over to the servitor, and slipped my poisoned blade into his gut! He screeched rather well, and fell over. I apologized to the priest of Baku for the disturbance and continued our game. Some people, though, just won't leave well enough alone! A Healer was called in and cleansed the fool and a Mage came in and turned my right leg to stone. As if I would leave a good game of chess! However, all the commotion threw my game completely off. So I was hauled off to jail. This annoyed me, too, so I pig-snorted at the guard-private that was taking me. Big mistake! Now, I'm a trouble- maker in addition to being a poisoner. Once in the jailcell, I was beaten severely by the guard, fitted with a ball and chain on my ankle and another on my wrist! The idiot put it on my right wrist, apparently not noticing that my sword was set for a left-hand draw. I was searched but the guard didn't find my money.\nTo amuse himself while waiting for Corporal Mudd to arrive (Mudd is the Lord Sheriff's right hand), the guard had me do laps around a puddle, dragging my ball and chain. The indignity of it! I, who was raised for better things, forced to perform for a guard!\nI had a brief conversation with an Oriental gentleman who thought that I was training my arm and leg to greater strength. I went along with this, hoping to convince him to help me out of the weight while the guard wasn't looking. I claimed to have lost the key and wished to change legs and arms so that I wouldn't develop lop-sided. He wished to help but had no way of opening the locks... Grrrr! But I kept a pleasant smile on my face. Fools must be suffered until time to fleece them.\nSoon Corporal Mudd arrived to hear my case. I freely admitted to killing... well... stabbing, anyway ... the servitor at the Inn, and gave my reason. The priest of Baku backed up my story (always smile at priests and donate to their god and you can get away with a lot), but it didn't do much good. Fortunately, Mudd didn't want to spend the day watching me in jail, so he let me go. But he took my sword! I pleaded with him to let me keep my sword. It's dangerous out there for an unarmed man! He was adamant. I strode off, seething.\nAfter I calmed down, I went back to the town scribe and asked nicely to talk to the Captain (getting Mudd's rank wrong - so I was sent to someone else). The scribe sent me to the Lord Sheriff! Oh well. I tried convincing the sheriff to give me my sword back but he checked my story against Mudd's first. He then fined me one silver and gave me my sword on condition that I return by noon the following day and pay the fine, or have the fine increased and be branded. Where am I going to get a silver by tomorrow?\nNothing for it but to waylay someone. And that's not easy in broad daylight! I finally saw someone trailing a little behind another group but my dagger got stuck in my robe. I had already made up my mind to take her, so I used my sword - I swear I didn't realize that there was still some poison on my blade! Her scream brought the others running, so I couldn't search her for some coin. Blast - my luck is running foul today.\nI managed to evade the chase and then took off my hood to change my appearance.\nOnce I got back to my cabin in Lowtown, I changed all my clothes to alter my description further. As I left my room, I noticed that there had been a fight outside. Two bodies were in the road. I checked one and he had no pulse. Quickly searching him, I came across two coppers. Going to the other, I saw that it was the Ra'Kash gypsy from my cabin. Searching quickly, I took a pouch containing one silver and nine coppers! A fortune! Also, enough to pay my fine! I left quickly as there were other people about. But as later events show, not quickly enough.\nI divided my take, taking the silver and three coppers and hiding the rest. As a courtesy, I left my roommate's money pouch (now empty) on his bed. Still having no pouch of my own, I stuffed the money into my cheek to hide it. Then, off I went to pay my fine.\nI no sooner got to the Inn to celebrate my new wealth, when I was arrested! It seems that I was seen after all as I was searching those two bodies. I was again beaten but now I was searched extensively. In frustration at finding nothing, the private took a practice sword and beat me bloody. After one such blow, the money flew from my mouth.\nI was then beaten senseless and the money taken. But the Ra'Kash could not identify me so I was released, protesting my innocence. Well, I still had my stash. Going back to my room, I checked my stash. Empty! I've been robbed! I hurried to the town scribe to ask the sheriff for an extension but the scribe told me that the matter had been given to Corporal Mudd to dispose of. Ouch! Nothing for it but to bite the swordhilt and go see him. I found him in the Inn.\nI explained my situation, offered services, even volunteered (gulp) for the guard (shudder). To no avail. Mudd wants the money. He must be getting part of it for himself. I looked up the scribe again and asked his advice about making some money. He suggested that I become a bounty hunter. Now that sounded interesting! However, I soon learned that to be a legal bounty hunter, I must register and pay a fee of two coppers! Me, with no money! I was considering my (short) future when the Famori mage, Psyche, made me an offer: if I could obtain the ingredients for a potion of Mana, she would pay me two silvers. Saved! I checked with an apprentice alchemist and found that I needed powdered ruby and Tantalos berries. Surely I could find the berries and I was sure that I could find a citizen with an extra ruby to 'share'. I set off with high hopes.\nI found out what to look for and searched far and wide but found nothing but a two-headed bear. Very friendly. Rub his stomach and feed him and he goes to sleep. I finally gave up the search and headed back to Lowtown. When I got there, red-faced monsters were running amok but seemed to be confined by the running water at the bridge. Here was my chance to make a difference! I called my intentions to the others so that the knowledge would not be lost if I died. I taunted the monster who was by the bridge to see if it could cross. It hesitated, then stepped onto the bridge. Running water, then, does not stop them. I called out this information and prepared to delay the monster so that the others could escape. It ripped me limb from limb.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Of course, Marge doesn't like to see me naked. Only the president of a nudist colony could blame her. I've got these blue-veined stork legs and a flabby body the color of baking soda.\nMost of the time it was, \"Charlie, did you remember to change the potting soil in the begonias?\" Tell the truth I never did and never remembered to put Rover's used Kibbles in the trash or clean the little brown ring out of the toilet either. Except for you couldn't get me to a rock concert at gun point, I guess you could say I was a standard issue 1974 husband give or take a bald spot or two. So anyway I was secretly thinking about divorce. A guy thing.\nYou know how that is; a guy always fantasizes about some slinky aerobics instructor in a red sundress and white sandals, never bothering to deal with the part about whether she'd be attracted to a shiny-domed number-cruncher in size 44 pants. So I said to Marge, \"Betsy's married now and our love life is pretty much on a par with sea anemones, so why don't we think about starting all over again.\"\n\"Charlie, if you're talking about divorce you'd better shut up, Mister,\" Marge said, twirling her sewing scissors. \"You leave me for a younger woman and I'll drag you through every divorce court between here and Las Vegas.\"\n\"Charlie,\" she said. \"A marriage is not about sex!\"\nWell she had that right! So anyway there I was driving to work my head full of stay or go or make a lawyer rich via alimony when I get backed up in traffic in one of those freeway construction deals - ALL TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT. I must have poked along for fifteen minutes hardly moving ten car lengths when something snapped and I swung past some orange barrels and took a left.\nIt was just like sliding through a revolving door. I came rolling out the other side smooth as whipped cream at a custom's inspection booth - ALL VEHICLES MUST STOP HERE! Was I carrying concealed firearms or any fresh fruit etc.? No, but did having my grandson's broken potty chair in the trunk by mistake count? OK, no problem.\nThe custom's inspector, an officious-looking bastard with a bow tie and a clipped mustache, ordered me out of the car for a briefing, so I ducked inside where it was air-conditioned.\nHis little office was plastered with gigantic pink wall maps and lists of Do's and Don'ts that I pretty much ignored.\n\"You understand you're here voluntarily for exactly six months? After that time period elapses you'll have to fill out paperwork and register an intention to become a permanent citizen. In the meantime you'll be able to do whatever you choose within the parameters of our bio\/social makeup.\"\nI wasn't quite sure what exactly the hell he was talking about; I was just damn glad to be out of the traffic jam, so I nodded my head yeah, yeah like I was right on top of things.\n\"Occupational choice and body build?\" he asked. \"Choose carefully. Decision irreversible.\"\nWell sure I was going to spend a new life being a bookkeeper and umpiring softball games all over again. \"Pro basketball player -- large,\" I said.\n\"Done!\" he said, handing me a card where to report and an instructional manual which I promptly managed to misplace somewhere in the clutter of my Cavalier. So away I drove. Everything there (wherever the hell there was )was tinted electrical blue with a nice moderate temperature and no traffic lights. The custom's guru had mentioned something about this place being the refracted mirror image of my native society, but frankly it didn't register. I'd never been much on science.\nWell anyway the team was over-joyed to have me. Why not? I was 7 feet 6 inches tall, could run like a gazelle, shoot like a rifle, dunk with either hand, dribble behind my back at full speed, and sell a little beer during timeouts if necessary. With me leading the way we were rolling through opponents like a nuclear bowling ball on a hundred pin alley. On the other hand, I wasn't getting that friendly with my new teammates. After the games I'd say, \"Hey let's go catch a beer, Vladimir.\"\n\"Nope. Hitting the pool.\"\nI'd try Jimbo. \"Hey, Jimbo, let's go suck up some suds.\"\nHe'd wink. \"Nah, going for a swim.\"\nSwimming sure! I'd flunked dog paddling and stopped laying out at the pool when I was sixteen and some wise teenage girl wanted to know if I was really that skinny or did my momma put me through the clothes' wringer. Anyway I'm whiling away my evenings in this brew pub when I spot this gorgeous redhead. You know what she reminded me of? She was a dead mirror image of Marge before she turned into a bag of flour and got the sixteen extra rhinoceros bulges on her abdomen. I don't know why, but the redhead and I hit it off from git go. Two weeks later she was up in my room.\nWrong ! Sorry Charlie! Somehow I'd failed to notice that the new slam-dunking me was lacking the appropriate instrumentation for an earth-type hookup. Hell, all I could do was laugh.\n\"Seemed like a great idea at the time,\" I said,\n\"That's ok, Charlie,\" Margel (that was her name) said. \"I'm missing an appropriate part too. Anyway we don't have to have sex to enjoy each other's company.\"\n\"Damn right,\" I lied, thinking \"but it sure would be nice.\"\nWell it wasn't that long after the debacle at my hotel room that Margel invited me to go swimming.\n\"Hey, what do we want to go swimming for?\" I said.\n\"Well we're both new here and that seems to be the thing to do in this country,\" she said.\n\"Sounds pretty ignorant to go do something we both can't just because every creep in this country thinks he's Mark Spitz.\"\nOf course I lost the debate and so we're down at this triple Olympic-size pool that looks like its filled with grape jello that hasn't quite set yet and we're splashing around and we see six gazillion teenagers holding these little blue five-dollar radios up to their ear.\n\"Wonder what's the big deal with the radios?\" I said to Margel.\n\"Beats me,\" she said, \"Let's borrow one and find out.\"\nWhoa ride 'em cowboy! Turned out to be the greatest thing since Elvis in leather pants and chocolate-covered graham crackers. Margel had the radio up to her ear and I was close by holding her hand and gangbusters! My eyes bulged out of my head, my hair stood on end, a silent scream went shooting through my left brain and rattled the window in my right brain. From the looks of Margel it hit her too except she stormed out of the pool with murder in her eyes.\n\"What the hell's going on here?\" I kept asking myself on the drive to the game. \"Why'd Margel have to go and get pissed off? I guess I better get a hold of one of those instruction manuals the custom's inspector was dishing out when I got here.\"\nThat evening after the game I rummaged around in my dit bag and scrounged up the guide book the custom's agent gave me when I came through the check point. \"Let the reader be warned that ignorance of the rules does not constitute forgiveness from the rules and blah, blah, blah.\" Then there it was on page 61 under POOL RULES - \"Be it understood that each sexual stimulation during natatation will result in forfeiture of two years of one's life expectancy; therefore, swimmers are advised to use discretion upon using battery-charged devices during pool experience.\"\n\"Hey two years no problem,\" I said to myself. \"Better call Margel, though, and let her know the deal.\"\n\"Oh, Charlie, you're nasty,\" Margel said when I read her the lowdown, \"What happened in the pool was not nice!\"\n\"Not nice? It was dynamite times six.\"\n\"For you maybe, Charlie, but I thought it was a disgusting violation of my privacy. And two years off one's life is a horrible price.\"\n\"C'mon, Margel; who's going to miss two years of sitting in the rocking chair looking for false teeth and reading prescription warnings.\"\n\"Oh, Charlie, no! Life is a precious thing. What about an old person's wife, and children, and grandchildren?\"\n\"Hey, they're happy to see you gone. No more listening to stale stories over and over.\"\n\"Oh no, Charlie, that's not right. People have feelings.\"\n\"Oh oh. So much for the swimming pool,\" I thought, but I said, \"You know what, kid, maybe you and I should go bowling tonight instead of the pool.\"\n\"Well that would be OK.\"\nNo sooner than I hung up with Margel I got a call from a familiar-sounding voice.\n\"Charlie Fullavet? This is the Bureau of Customs. You have completed five months and 22 days of your trial period. This is a reminder that you must report to our offices in one week and inform us of your intentions as to whether or not you plan to seek full-time residency status here. Thank you.\"\nWhoa six months had fast-forwarded and just when I'm getting to know the ropes of the place, whammo one week left and I'm faced with the toughest decision of my life.\nCount on it I didn't spend the first day of my last week practicing my free throws. Carrying my own little battery-powered radio, I was down at the pool when it opened. Bingo bug eyes at 7:02. Hair erect at 7:14. Screaming out loud at 7:21, and flat on my back under water with a mega at 7:33. That's when this huge blond lifeguard dragged me out.\n\"Hey, buddy, you realize you just zonked eight years off your life?\"\n\"So?\"\n\"So you're committing suicide, man. I can't let you do it. Page 303 of the rules.\"\nDisappointed in one way, but glad the jerk stopped me in another, I got my clothes on and headed out to a pub. I was sitting there nursing a pint, thinking about Rover, Betsy, the grandson, and even Marge and feeling the blues when in walked Margel. There was a storm cloud distorting her face and it looked like we were headed for a red tornado.\n\"Charlie, the more I think about it the more disgusted I am with you.\"\n\"Disgusted with me. What'd I do?\"\n\"You should have known the rules. You took advantage of me in that swimming pool and we're not even married. In fact for all I know you might even be married yourself.\"\n\"It was an accident, Margel, and besides nobody's married here.\"\n\"Well I'm not from here and neither are you, and where I come from people get married before they climb into swimming pools together.\"\n\"We hardly even touched each other, Margel!\"\n\"That's the point, Charlie. It's so impersonal. It's just sex. Love should be more than just a buzzer going off. And this morning you down there in the pool six times all by yourself. Don't think I didn't hear about it.\"\n\"What did it hurt? It didn't mean anything.\"\n\"That's what's wrong with it, Charlie. It's got about as much meaning as eating as running a vacuum cleaner. And you slowly committing suicide over it. And besides you looked awful in a swimming suit. So the bottom line is I just don't want to see you anymore. You understand?\"\nThe lecherous, blond hunk that Margel took up with looked like he'd been carved out of stone. I swear if they'd gone near the swimming pool I'd have done something stupid. I couldn't even stand to see them stare into one another's eyes. It was down right erotic - without a doubt the worst week of my life.\nOn Monday the customs inspector looked at me like I'd grown an extra nose. \"You're going back? Nobody goes back,\" he said. \"Back to headaches and heartaches and hassles; back to plumbing and peeing and monthly payments?\"\n\"You got it, buddy,\" I said. \"You see I've got a loyal wife and family and a dog back in the states.\"\n\"If you just want a wife and a dog, we can supply you with several of each. You're making a stupid mistake. You do understand your decision is irrevocable? You realize we have an extensive waiting list of malcontents?\"\n\"Well then there's one other thing,\" he said. \"The telegram.\"\n\"What telegram?\"\n\"This one.\"\nI opened the little green envelope with a feeling of dread and tried to absorb the words, but they just wouldn't sink in. \"Please return immediately for funeral. Mom died unexpectedly on 28 June, 1999. Believed cause - broken heart. Betsy. Daddy, come home.\"\nI guess I was still sitting there with wet eyes when the driver in the cars behind me started honking like I was parked on his foot. When I looked up, the construction bottleneck had started to unclog. The flagman at the side of the road was grinning like an idiot, waving us through like he hadn't noticed we'd been frying in the sun for a half-hour.\nEven though my eyes were blurry with tears and I felt a little dizzy with the sun, I tromped on the gas, determined to turn around at the next exit and head for home. Sad part was, however - now I realized it was already too late.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

They had been married for 18 of those years, happily so, and neither had any complaints about their life. Their one child, Jon, was at a sleep-over at a friend's house and they had spent the evening reminiscing over a candlelit dinner and an old movie they both loved.\nAs they lay down to bed there came a scratching at the front door, just across the hall. At first both pretended not to hear it, dismissing the sound as the wind or imagination. Then it came again, more distinct.\n\"Bill, what is that?\" Mary turned toward him, her face dimly lit by the moonlight.\n\"Just the wind, or maybe a stray cat. Jones' ran away, Jake said. Maybe that's it. Don't worry about it or you'll be up all night. Get some rest.\" Bill rolled over and slept.\nMary turned over, but couldn't sleep. The sound of the scratching kept coming louder and louder, but Bill apparently didn't hear it. Mary looked at him thoughtfully, then closed her eyes.\nThe scratching came again, much louder and Mary's eyes shot open.\n\"Bill, wake up!\" She shook him violently.\n\"What? What is it?\" He rubbed his eyes and looked at her.\n\"That cat is going to scratch the door to pieces, by the sound of it. Can't you shoo it away for me?\"\n\"Mary, if you need that cat gone so bad you're going to have to take the broom and shoo it away yourself. I'm not going to get out of bed just so I can get rid of some vermin at my door. After all, Mary, it is just a cat.\"\n\"Fine, if that's the way you're going to be-\"\n\"That's the way I'm going to be.\" Bill closed his eyes and turned his back to her again.\nMary got up out of bed, muttering to herself, grabbed the broom from the corner and proceeded to the front door.\nWhen she got there the scratching had stopped.\n\"Stupid cat anyway, keeping people up to all hours of the night \" She said as she opened the door, but there was nothing there.\nShe knelt down to look at the door in the dim moonlight, but the bottom of the door was unmarked. She looked up and gasped as she stood.\nThe top of the door, eye-level and above, was scratched and splintering, looking as if someone had taken a hacksaw to it. \"What kind of-\"\nShe stopped short when she felt warm breath on the back of her neck, and a clawed paw on her shoulder. Before she could cry out it was upon her. Bill was awakened by the sound of the front door slamming shut, and a shuffling sound in the hall.\n\"Mary, is that you? Come back to bed, the scratching stopped.\" He tried to see her shape in the darkness, but couldn't. \"Who are you?\"\n\"Just a cat,\" it replied. \"I'm just a cat.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He may have once or often been tracked during a less nervous era, SIMCHA mis-analyzing the transmissions as public-noised pulsars, sunspots, vague starspots or ubiquitous background radiation.\nOr because his transmission style hadn't stood out, might have been a patchwork based on static-loaded snatches he'd picked up second-hand, federal security and smugglers' codes, soccer play-by-plays, stock quotes, navigators' musings.\nOr because the coded tongue he used, when broken down, is too much like the long-dead Island talk - the one they'd cooked up just to deal with strangers.\nOur Island folk, the Old Ones for sure, must have wandered to the Boss's node long years ago to trade and left their tongue, and memories. Brigham ponders, hates to have to tell me this, but \"They don't seem the sort,\" don't have, never had, the fit technology, \"fit\" meaning what I think it means.\nWhat went wrong? Wood, stone and bone are what their hands speak now (away from their city, un-slept-in as it reamed its way to the future) but in pre-dawn times their hands spoke copper, iron, silica and gold, canoes slipped out beyond the narrows they keep watch on now. They've no great gray crabs today to raise their sunken hulls, each hull a name. What made them drop the long strides and the broad paddle strokes? Or made them say the hell with it.\nOr the Boss himself had wandered through when young (if young) to study, rob or save us, learned the Island talk and took it home, along with - we don't miss it. What evidence would he or his coach or his trainees or his camp followers have left behind? Baubles, trinkets, sealed and buried canisters, sand-clogged gunsights. Or living evidence: Marsupials or viruses or unusual varieties of maize or unusual ethnic groups huddled in the wings, not eager to be next.\nThe evidence would be obvious. The Boss's brethren free on someone else's world, without permit, would leave scars. Not obvious; we wouldn't know they were scars.\nDr. Crespo had been covering those Islands since the summer of 4.5\/3 (n.c.). Of his dry dispatches to wisdom journals over the years, only the note on \"the Abandoned\" of Island 518 sparked controversy.\n\"The implicit assumption,\" he wrote carefully, \"except where scholars lose their appetite - or shall I say their guts ['i suoi testiculi' in the first edition; 'i suoi visceri' subsequently] - is ever thus: The confectioner who creates the pastry, the urchin who endeavors in vain to fly off with it, and the patron who ultimately delights in it, share the same taste, die for the same spoonful.\n\"And why not, I ask, for the kitchen toiler and the dining hall glutton are, I am sure it disgusts you to learn, intrinsically the same. But reluctantly, and I suspect to your relief, one makes an exception.\"\nHe explained.\nThat dispatch drew Rose Benedict, then a young professorella, to 518, not to prove Crespo wrong - that's petty - but to see and feel for herself.\nShe returned home in less than a month, her flaming red hair now white. She never published her findings.\nCyrus Hagstrom came to 518 to put this folk on his map, and found they had an old map of their own. And a wrinkled leather alphabet. Scholars with lost appetite have sworn to hunt up any Mayan, Khmer, Nilotic, or Phoenician influence, assuming\/proving\/hoping Islanders never harvested their own thoughts, never hoarded them on paper, rag, wood, bronze or stone without a ray or two of strangers' inspiration.\nIn the rush to claim or blame, Renfrew narrows it to the Fathers glimpsed at the Mont Saint-Canaque mission. Brother Theobald snorts, shares Malcolmson's view of the Fathers as too hide-bound to teach things as radical as literacy.\nFather Miereanu concedes converts in these Islands were fewer than elsewhere, where strong chiefs (Curzon's word; Fornander: \"kings\") ruled broad lands and obedient multitudes. One solid God-book-talk with such a chief, with his clear view of the gunboats offshore, and he was converted; through him, the whole valley, the whole world perhaps. But how does one convert an endless chain of small autonomous Islands? Threaten and preach to every one? Every single... good God.\nBrigham suspects a king hides in the Islands, the last true king, who'd seen the trouble coming, disbanded the kingdom and disguised himself as one more dense village elder\/ bossboi\/topfella, the missionaries could never figure out. He spends his vacations searching for that king or the king's successors; pretends not to search, not to care, which makes the folk suspicious. He says he's found nothing, or no one, but he fingers his silica bracelet, and mumbles to it, and bows to it. Or nods, which is almost a bow.The Compleat Adventurer, part 3 \u00a9 1998 Fred Noweck\nWhen next I came from Fate, I noticed something different. I now had faith! I, who followed no gods! I went to Laric, the Elfin Cleric, for advice. He brought me to the High Cleric. He told me that the gift of Faith must be used and that I could probably Heal with it. This was a wonderful gift! I told Psyche and the Human Warrior who shared my cabin and we decided to search the woods for supplies together. Psyche and a Ra'Kash female had gone off to freshen themselves when Rudolfo, the Gypsy King, approached us. He asked if we would help him retrieve a very special magical item for him from the Famori Undercity. He had no permits to go there, so if we were caught, we were on our own. He told us that anything that we found we could keep as long as we gave him the item he was looking for: a special fortune-telling card made by the Master Mage Bruce. \"You can tell it is a Bruce card because it says 'Bruce' across it!\" We agreed.\nWe left the women behind, not for any reasons of chivalry, but because the inclusion of the Human and myself made six in the party - a mystic number and the most that could enter the Undercity unnoticed. The Famori built underground, so Rudolfo led us to the entrance of the caves, and left us.\nAs we entered, we found that only the Human had a light spell, and then we found that the spell had spoiled! It was useless! As we waited for our eyes to adjust to the faintly glowing fungus on the cave walls, I took the precaution of applying poison to my blade (I was surprised that the small vial was back in its hiding place. I thought that I had used it all.) We crawled through the tunnels, fog following us, making things even dimmer!\nThe Ra'Kash Warrior found the first chamber (her sword was bigger than she was!) and we all straightened up to get the kinks out that crawling puts in. But we found nothing there. I, then, took the lead. Putting all my senses to work to detect what might lie ahead... the tunnel divided... I took the right fork. Ahead was a chamber. I cautiously entered... but to no avail. A shadow rose in front of me... I cried out a warning even as I was cut down. When I was revived, the fight was over. The Healers were going among the wounded (myself included) casting healing spells. I searched the monsters' bodies while the others searched the chamber. There were some coins on them but I couldn't tell what they were without light. We continued on. We came to another branching tunnel... again I chose the right-hand path. And there, in a small chamber, was a richly dressed corpse. I checked the body and found a couple of coins. Then I checked the altar at the corpse's head while the Dwarf checked the body again. In this near darkness, this is a wise precaution. There, on the altar, was an Amulet that positively stank of magic! I checked it for traps but found none. I removed it and checked the rest of the altar - nothing. We explored several other chambers, finding nothing. Until we came upon the final chamber. There a monster awaited unlike any we had ever seen. What we could see of it in the dark. I fell to the first attack as I was leading again, but was quickly Healed and back into the fray. I awaited my chance and when opportunity beaconed, slid my poisoned blade into its chest. Rather than let it suffer, we granted it a quick death, then searched it. We found a few coins (So far all the treasure has been in dribs and drabs). There was a box on the table. I carefully checked the box, but could find no obvious traps. I settled myself, set my mind to avoid any traps that I sprang, and carefully opened the box. No trap. Now I had to get my heart back under control! Checking the box, we found several coins. Curse this darkness! We can't see what we have found! We searched the chamber but found no other exit. We re-entered the tunnels but were unable to go any farther. We turned around, with myself in the lead again. I sniffed the air. My senses told me that there was at least one other chamber that we had not gone through. I let my senses guide us now. There! A narrow opening that was not noticed before! I led the way through to another chamber but found no guardian monsters. A chest of drawers by one wall. I sniffed again... there is something familiar here but it escapes me momentarily. I cautiously pick up a Scroll tube, but then realize to my horror that I wasn't careful enough. My senses had tried to tell me. Contact poison! I barely managed to croak out a warning before losing consciousness.\nThe Dwarf was the only one with a cleanse spell left (and what was a Dwarf doing with such a thing?). When I recovered from the effects of the poison, the others were already taking the chest apart. The Dwarf kept the Spell Scroll. The coins were handed to me to hold. I led the way again, my senses telling me that there was still another chamber. After several deadends, I finally found it. An Alchemist's Study! There were potions in a rack, several coins, and a mortar and pestle with poison in it according to my nose. I had nothing to get a sample in, so tried to take the mortar and pestle. It wouldn't move! A fortune in fine poison and I had to leave it! Oh, the injustice of it all! Finding nothing further, we left toward the tunnel exit. After we left the caves, I realized to my chagrin, that we had failed to check one place - under the rug in the first chamber! Perhaps I can come back later by myself and check it. Meanwhile, we need to check out what we have away from prying eyes and while we still have light as the day is far advanced. I pull the coins from my pantaloons where I stored them - a good haul, but not when split six ways. We examine the Amulet but aside from being magic, can tell nothing about it. The spell scroll and potions we will have to have someone who can read the runes to tell what we have. We go to the Silvermane Inn to look for a (reasonably) trustworthy soul who can read the runes.\nAfter dividing up the coins, the Dwarf approaches one that he can trust to check what he has. The potions are a potion of Healing (always handy) and a potion of Air Mana. But the Mana potion is of low quality. We sell it to a Mage for six coppers. The Dwarf is sure that the Scroll is worth at least ten silvers but in the interest of a quick sale, we agree on six silver ( the more easily to divide it). I have my fine! I agree with the Mage to trade my portion of the Amulet (which is worthless to me anyway) for his portion of the scroll. Two silvers now! I am wealthy! I must find Corporal Mudd and pay my fine before anything else happens! I hide most of my money and take one silver and four coppers with me. In view of the way my money had been stolen the last time, I don't hide it in my room this time.\nI located Mudd and paid my fine - he showed no curiosity about how I obtained it so fast - curious - I will have to investigate further when I get the chance - perhaps a little blackmail is in order? Remembering the Scribe's advice, I look him up and register as a Bounty Hunter. You can't have too many irons in the fire, after all! In an excess of good feeling, I go toward Hightown to donate two coppers to Baku.\nBefore I leave the Inn, I notice a gypsy reeling in weakness. On finding out that his Vitality is low, I grant him one of the Vitality points made possible by the gift of Fate. He is somewhat recovered and promises the Friendship of the Rom for this favor. Things are looking up!\nI go toward Hightown but on the bridge I meet a Jester who offers to buy me a drink at the Inn. I never turn down a free drink! Maybe I should have. When I pieced it together after I returned from Fate, when the Jester touched me, he cast a spell of Drunkenness on me and then goaded me into a fight - I had no chance.\nI also noticed something else - the Faith that I had as a Gift of Fate was now gone.\nI headed toward the Inn, when Rock (one of the Warg guards) told me that I was wanted at the guard hall. Wondering what was amiss, I went with him. For a Warg, Rock is a fairly decent sort. He led me to the jail, took me inside, and then locked me up! Although, he did forget to take my sword from me. Once Mudd arrived, I found out that I was accused of killing a Priest! I never! As the story came out, though, I found out that it was the woman from the (botched) robbery of just that morning. She couldn't identify me but others made a partial identification from the clothes that I had worn that morning. I denied everything, of course. I did feel bad about that one, though.\nWhen the Guard Captain arrived, he told me that I could either stay in jail all night and face trial in the morning or I could trust in the judgment of the gods by being in the front ranks of the defenders when Abraxas attacked that evening. It seems that a special alignment of the planets would open a vortex to the Void that night, releasing Abraxas and his Demon Horde. At ant rate, the Guard Captain told me that if I survived, obviously I had the favor of the gods and was innocent, and if I didn't, well, what was one less thief? I thought that there was something wrong with his logic but I wasn't about to point it out. Then I found out that I was to be chained in the front ranks! There would be no retreat for me!\nOf course, I was killed in the first rush, revived by a Battle-Cleric, killed again, revived again, and finally killed without revival. As my spirit went to Fate, I wondered what would happen this time.\nI approached Fate. His features distorted even to spirit-sight. He had me kneel and choose four of his mystic cards to represent Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Of those four, I had to choose one as my Fate. Of the four elements, I chose Fire. Fate looked at the card chosen, and told me to return to life with all abilities intact and with full memory! I couldn't believe it! No one ever left Fate with memory! However, you don't argue with Fate. Returning to Life, I saw that the battle was over, so I went to bed.\nSunday morning - I awoke and left the others to fend for themselves. If they couldn't get up, they deserved what happened. I made my way to the Inn and smelled the aroma of black potion and sweetcakes. Greeting several of the townsfolk that I had met the previous day, I finished my potion and left the Inn. There I heard that someone had stolen the High Chancellor's banner! Perhaps a reward would be offered! I joined a search party and headed to Lowtown.\nThe search went badly. We found nothing. Upon returning to town, we found that Ken Shai, the Oriental Mystic, had confessed to taking the banner and been arrested! Impossible. The man wouldn't hurt a fly. (He would gently kill you but he wouldn't hurt a fly) What's more, he could neither read nor write Common and could not say what had been written on the banner by the perpetrator(s) . He was obviously protecting someone. While I was speaking to him, a Ra'Kash female came up to me and asked me to escort her to Hightown as she could not find her papers. This was my chance to get in good with the sheriff and collect a bounty at the same time! Fool that I am, I agreed. As we were passing the guard station, I grasped her shoulder so that she could not escape, and called out to Corporal Mudd. \"I've brought you a Ra'Kash who has no papers!\"\nThis got immediate attention, as all Ra'Kash must have their papers on them at all times. Whereupon, the Ra'Kash purred sweetly, opened her pouch, and produced the 'lost' papers. \"Here they are. I found them.\"\nI realized then that I had been set up. If I turn her in, I make the sheriff angry for accosting a registered Ra'Kash. If I don't turn her in, I am arrested for trying to smuggle an illegal Ra'Kash through town. I glared at her, memorizing her markings. I'll keep an eye on this one.\nAs I returned to town, Rudolfo pulled me aside.\n\"You see? I got one.\" and showed me the Bruce card. It was the Kantara card and he was right: it was incredibly beautiful. I filed this information away for future use. Perhaps the Brigand Band would pay for this information. I congratulated Rudolfo on his good fortune.\nWhen I returned to my cabin, I learned that someone had told Mudd that I had the Lord Chancellor's banner and he had torn my few belongings apart searching for it. A chill went over me. I have a deadly enemy.\nNow it is noon and the weekend is over. We all get out of costume and return to the 'real' world... until next time.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Edwards, U.E.S.S. Uluru Maiden Voyage.\nSomething has gone very wrong.\nI am alone, the sole survivor from the explosion. But not for long. Life Support systems have failed, as everything else. In a few hours I will be dead.\nBut it is not the nearness of death frightens me, that presses in all around me, like some invisible power that chokes me so I can hardly breathe. Or am I breathing the last dregs of good air left, even now?\nNo, it is fear. Fear...and loneliness.\nUnlike any explorer before me, I alone take the thankless honor of being the loneliest human in history. In the uncharted and unknown depths of space, unable to return to Earth, I sit amid the darkened corridors of my dying ship. To die alone. And I don't even know where here is.\nSo, that makes me the most lost explorer too.\nI never have liked to be alone. But here I am, untold light years from another human, the deep blackness of silent space staring at me from the unlighted portals. Silence. Not even the artificial, lifeless sounds of the ship or my beloved computers.\nSilence. Darkness. And the silence seems to grow, to roar in my mind. I never realized how loud silence can be!\nMy only friend, my only solace, is the solitary beam of my flashlight against my pad and paper as I write. It is my only link to sanity right now. As I wait...\nWhy couldn't I have died with the rest! Why couldn't one other have lived, to keep me from this dark loneliness? For to die alone must be the greatest of tragedies.\nThey died together, selfishly.\nMy only hope is that death will come soon. And yet, where there is hope...\nNo. There is no hope of rescue. This was Earth's first attempt to exceed the speed of light. There are no other ships like the Uluru back home to come after me. She was the prototype. And even if there was another ship, how would they find me in time! How would they know where to look?\nSo, I will die out here, surrounded by the vast emptiness of space. As I stare outside the porthole, I recognize no known constellations, no familiar stars. Nothing.\nThere is one star nearby, I can see it outside the port viewing area. It is red in color, the disc I can barely make out. So, it must be close. And even though its light is faint, it gives me just the faintest comfort from the darkness, and my loneliness.\nAll systems are down. I have just returned from a quick survey of this portion of the ship. It is a dead ship. The air is harder to breath. The darkness presses in.\nI have no reason to say good-bye, I have no one to say good-bye to, back on Earth. They made sure of that when they signed us aboard. Either the few relatives signed off on any legal rights, or like myself, we had no relatives to leave behind. Fewer lawsuits that way. Keeps the profits intact, I guess.\nEverything started fine. Of course, I know nothing about the new engines or the mighty processes that powered them. But I know they fired up just fine. I watched some of the readouts in my area. Hours passed. When the officers suddenly left my area, I was sternly ordered to stay put. I wanted to go, but I stayed. I knew something was very wrong.\nThere was an emergency venting of anti-matter, I saw that message. That's about all that I know before everything started to fail. It happened at full speed. And then the massive explosion.\nI wish I knew more. Maybe it would help, if anyone ever reads this.\nThe main computer room was sealed off from the rest of the ship. That's what saved me from the initial release of atmosphere until the ship sealed off the breached sections. Battery power must have taken over immediately. I must have been knocked unconscious. Sometime later, after I had regained consciousness, I walked slowly through the sections of the ship still accessible to me. Only then did it dawn on me that I was the only one left.\nIt was a very bad feeling.\nJanuary 28, 2188\nI did finally eat something, I think it was roast beef mush. It probably was my last meal. I will go to the port view screen and watch the red star and its faint companions until I join the rest of the crew. After I write this last little bit.\nI wish I had someone to talk to. I have known loneliness in my life, but I have never felt so alone as now. Looking out at that black emptiness, faintly dotted with those faraway pin-points of light, the loneliness threatens to overwhelm me. I am shaking so much that I can barely hold the pen to write this. Perhaps it is the cold, I cannot seem to get warm anymore. I hope the end is near.\nSomething strange is happening! Some of the stars have gone out! I thought I might be hallucinating, but I suddenly saw one go out right before my eyes. It was so fast! What is happening?!?\nI am shaking uncontrollably. The cold seems to be gripping my very heart. My breath is a white vaporous cloud and it hurts to breath too deeply. All of the stars have disappeared now, even the close red one. There is nothing but a stygian blackness outside. My penlight is low as well. So is my life. Maybe I am already dead.\nIt is a ship!\nIt is alien.\nIt has drawn close alongside. Strange orange lights flood towards me. I can see an eerie orange glow reflecting back on the winding, gnarled, snaking contours of the ship. It's color is black. Ribbons or bands seem to wind infinitely around and around the overall oblong shape of it. It is huge.\nI wonder what they will do.\nI hear them coming. Strange scraping sounds mixed with loud snaps. They're getting louder. Now I hear a high pitched buzzing sound!\nI have tried to stand, but I keep sliding back down somehow. I wish I had a weapon, but I don't think I could use it. My hands shake too much.\nI am afraid.\nJanuary ?? 2188\nI do not know where I am or how I got here. I do not know how much time has passed. But I do know that I am no longer on the Uluru.\nThe room I am in is round in shape, there are no corners anywhere, like the inside of a hollow egg. Where I lay is flat, but all around me the room curves upward to another slightly flat area directly above my head. There is a pile of food packets next to me, enough for several days. My spent flashlight, a pen and my notepad are the only other items here.\nBut at least I am warm.\nSecond day.\nI have met the aliens.\nThey look more comical than frightening. I am glad of that.\nThey walk on three long spindly legs, each about two feet in length, which connect to a round black body about three feet in diameter. Hundreds of small rubber-like tentacles encompass it's body, each about six inches long. Among this ever waving throng seven longer, though not as long as the legs, stick-like arms protrude. These seven appendages remind me of a spider, though the three legs seem much stiffer and bend outward about halfway down. There is no semblance of toes or fingers that I can discern. I can't tell if they have eyes, though there is some kind of black globular mass near the very top of the little round body which they seem to point at each other. I have seen at least three small openings that could be mouths.\nThank God that they don't seem to have sharp, pointy teeth.\nI believe I scared them. I didn't mean to. As several of them crawled into the room I stood up. The rearmost one quickly scrambled back out of the circle door that had suddenly opened to let them all inside. The other two froze as I rose above them, except for their hundreds of waving appendages, which really began to wiggle.\nI felt my heart sink in disappointment as they drew near me. I tried talking to them, and I think they tried to talk back. But all that I could discern were high pitched humming and whining noises coming from them. They move in quick, jerky motions. And they are always moving about, except for the moment that I scared them. They seem to have a metabolism similar to humming birds.\nFunny, I have never thought of myself as important. And yet, here I am, the first human to meet an intelligent race. Of all the billions who ever lived, I will represent my kind.\nIt scares me a little. These beings may judge the whole human race by what I do now. I will have to show them our good qualities such as love, intelligence, cooperation and the like. I will do my best. I just hope my best is good enough.\nI hope they can learn to communicate with me. It may be difficult for me to learn their humming language. And though I am no longer afraid, that heavy feeling of loneliness is again weighing on me.\nEarth is far away, and I have no one to talk to.\nThird day with aliens.\nThey hurt me today.\nI was shot first with some kind of spray. I panicked when I realized that I couldn't move anymore. I watched helplessly as they took their instruments and gathered around me.\nThey used them on me.\nI wish that I could have been unconscious, instead of being able to watch everything. I wish I could have run. I wish I could have screamed.\nIt is night now as I try to write this. They sprayed me again just before they left and now I can move, though even the slightest movement causes excruciating pain.\nI cannot put my clothes back on.\nI lay curled up naked and shaking with the pain for a long time, going in and out of consciousness. Blood seeps out of every orifice of my body. Before I could put my pants back on, my underwear was wet with blood. Even my tears are stained red as I wipe my shaking hands across my swollen face. And the pain inside my body, where they probed. I must sleep...\nI am awake again.\nMy eyes are swollen almost shut, the throbbing pain of my torn sinuses keeps me from even sitting up. And a loud humming must mean my eardrums have been damaged. At least the rest of my body, and my bloody wounds, are numb now.\nI lay here trying to write again, unable to sleep because the pain wakes me, wondering if it might have been better to have died with the rest.\nIf I could only communicate with them! I could tell them that they hurt me.\nThat is now my goal, to talk with them. After all, I am the first human to meet an alien race. It is my duty.\nI only wish I knew what to do. What is the first step??? I must observe them and find a way.\nMaybe, when we learn to talk, I can get them to take me back to Earth?\nI will try.\nDay Five?\nI think they worked on me again, but I am not really sure. Maybe I just slept an extremely long time due to the pain. Anyway, I feel a little better though my side is extremely sore and my nose is completely stopped up. I breathe awkwardly by mouth, and I can feel a heaviness inside my sinuses. It is burden almost to breathe this way.\nOne of the aliens is with me. His three legs are bent up under his body, so he seems to be sitting and watching me while I write and eat my breakfast. Or maybe he is asleep?\nI will try something.\nI flicked my pen towards him and it fell just short of him. The short hairlike appendages moved all at once and then stopped. He used one of his seven arms, encircled the pen with the tip of one of them, and threw it back at me. His throw was short too!\nHe imitated me!\nI am now writing down the letters of the alphabet. And two words. I am going to try communicating.\nI don't know if it worked or not.\nI showed him the word man and then pointed to myself. Then I showed him the word alien and pointed to him. For the first time, they really reminded me of a black basketball that can walk. It remained totally still while I pointed and spoke, again and again.\nI probably should have showed him the word stupid and pointed to both of us.\nI just tried again. He stood very still when I drew close and then I pointed to that mass on top of his head with the sheet of paper. Then I carefully enunciated the word man and pointed at myself.\nHe didn't even make a sound.\nThen I pointed at the word alien and started to point at him when he suddenly leaped into the air and backed into the wall. I think he must have been disappointed when the circle door did not open because he began tapping with several of his seven arms on the wall quite rapidly.\nThe door opened seconds later and he jumped through it but seemed to hesitate halfway through.\nI crumpled up the message and threw it through the door which shut after it had landed near him.\nI must have done something wrong, but I don't know what. Well, there is nothing else for me to think about or do, so I will try to think of some other way of communicating with them.Poem: strata \u00a9 1998 David Kopaska-Merkel\nEach hole sunk\nuncovered ghosts:\nplaster doll's foot, pill bottle,\ncharred bone.\nThey began to lay their own\nstrata in the centuried soil.\nGifts for the nonforged hoe.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Most studies had ended a month ago but select classes ran over with special exams and other forms of evaluation. Had Ian known that Environmental Science required a field study after the final exam had been given to give closure to the course, he would have never signed up for it to begin with. He should have had enough to since not to listen to a statistics major.\nThe crevices in the aged parking lot gleamed a furious red under the tall lights that had been constructed into the small campus' parking lots. Ian couldn't remember having had any rain that evening. If there had been, it hadn't been hard enough to provoke the trademark drumming on the ceiling of his cramped bedroom. Even if it had rained, that didn't account for the red tint of the liquid standing tranquilly in every crack of the asphalt. But Ian wasn't up for analyzing and there were far too many possibilities to support a flawless excuse.\nBy the time Ian had reached his decrepit ticket home, his train of thought had altered to numerous random subjects, none linked to the one before or after. He reached into the oversized pocket on his jeans and pulled his sphere of keys from the lint-smothered depths smelling of winterfresh gum and gasoline from countless lighters. He leaned his body against the driver's side door of his car and surfed through the keys, searching sluggishly for the key to the door. When he finally found it, he grasped it loosely and trembled the sphere until all of the temporarily useless keys fell to the lower half of the ring. With an unprecedented smirk, he jabbed the rigid key into the keyhole and attempted to turn it counter-clockwise.\n\"Not again,\" he mumbled under his breath as he continuously tried to turn the key in its hole, some mechanism inside broken for the third time in two months. His wrist tired, the flesh under his fingernails white, he callously pulled the key from its slot and began to trudge around to the passenger side of the car. Once there, the key easily slid into the keyhole and turned clockwise until the silver door lock inside jumped up in rapt attention. Ian pulled open the door and reached inside to press on the automatic door lock located on the door handle of the passenger side door. A muted click emitted from hidden springs and Ian proceeded to close the passenger door and swing back around to the driver's side door of his rusted Ford. He climbed in, leaving one foot out in the parking lot, and rose his set of keys to the small light located in the center of the car behind the front two seats. He rotated the collection of keys around again until he found the key to the ignition, which he slid carelessly into the ignition and turned clockwise until the engine whined, sputtered and fell silent.\n\"What the he-\" Ian began before feeling a twinge of body rattling pain run down the back of his neck and to the base of his spine. Before he could bite his lip to mute a painful groan, his vision tripped to black and he slumped over in the driver's seat of his car.\nIan's vision lingered in psychedelic colors before creeping back to normal standards. After gaining some composure, he looked around to find himself still sitting in the driver's seat of his car. The sun was midway through its daily trek and the parking lot remained empty except for himself. He leaned back in his seat and stretched his arms back, attempting to loosen muscles tightened after spending the night in an awkward position in his humble vehicle. As soon as the back of his head touched the headrest on his driver's seat, his body rocketed forward in angry discontent, throwing his forehead against the windshield of the car.\nOnce the temporary blindness subsided, Ian arched his neck to look into the rear view mirror. His skin looked surprisingly pale while the bulk of his eyes had turned a pale blue. A red circle was already forming on the center of his forehead as a smudge of oil on the windshield marked his site of injury.\nAs his eyes continued to trace his features with undying curiosity and a feeble desire to remember the occurrences of the previous night, an unsuspected knocking came at his driver's side window.\nAfter lowering his heartbeat to its normal rate, Ian reached down and rolled down the window using the manual crank.\n\"Hey, Ian,\" Professor Briggs began, his eyes all the while searching the contents of the car. \"What are you still doing out here? All of the kids have gone home as well as a majority of the teachers. Why, I'm one of the last ones here and I'm on my way out as we speak.\"\n\"I had some things to take care of, Professor,\" Ian replied mundanely, his voice a deep monotone.\n\"Please, call me Jack,\" the professor proclaimed as he thrusted his hand in through the partially lowered window. Awkwardly, Ian reached up with the appropriate hand. \"After all, classes are out and you passed my class with flying colors.\" Jack Briggs snatched Ian's hand and shook it with masked fervor. His wrinkled brow contorted into random shapes as he did his best to smile warmly in Ian's presence. After numerous failed attempts at appearing friendly, Briggs retracted his hand from the depths of Ian's car and crammed it into one of the pockets on his vest.\n\"Well, I suppose I'll be seeing you then,\" Jack declared as he began to back away from the car.\n\"Probably so, with my luck,\" Ian mumbled under his breath as he instinctively reached to the ignition on the steering column and turned his keys methodically until the engine began. It struck him as odd that the keys were still there.\n\"What was that?\" Briggs asked innocently as he continued to back away on the heels of his Italian leather wingtips.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"You said something,\" Jack persisted.\n\"You must have heard the engine whining. Sometimes I think it's talking to me, too,\" Ian lied.\n\"You have a good summer, Ian. By the way, you have something on your neck,\" Jack concluded as he bent at the waist subtly and revealed his face to Ian a final time, swiping at the right side of his neck.\nNodding a thank you, Ian released the parking brake, threw the car into drive, and pulled away from his assigned parking space in the shadow of his former dorm. As he crept over the series of speed bumps that led off of the campus, he peered up into the rear view mirror and caught a glance of two black specks on his neck. He'd take a shower when he got home.\n\"Ian!\" his mother shrieked as she shot out of the doorway and waddled across the gravel driveway with her arms spread to a wingspan of some seven feet. Her floral nightgown rustled around her in timed sways of to and fro until she finally reached the driver's side door of his car. Before he could even pull his keys from the ignition, Kay pulled open his car door and launched her lengthy arms into the hazy interior of his car. Cheap cigarette smoke crept out from the quarantined air inside and brushed Kay back enough for Ian to crawl out of his car and shut the door, checking habitually to make sure that it was, indeed, locked.\n\"How have you been, son?\" her crackling voice inquired causing the wrinkled flap of skin under her chin to tremble.\n\"As well as can be expected, I guess,\" Ian answered as he dropped his set of keys into his pocket.\nThe thin flap of skin under her chin flared and bloated with sheer glee as Ian's suave voice tickled her memories.\nBut without warning, her aura changed, the alteration showing in her beaded brow. A pudgy hand burrowed deeply into the broad pockets on her nightgown and retreated with a bright handkerchief. Once she had applied it to an eager tongue, she darted it towards Ian's neck, her dentures chewing on her lower lip with belligerent intentions.\nIan deftly swayed to the side, avoiding the relentless onslaught of maternal saliva.\n\"Don't be so childish,\" Kay whined as she continued to stab the dampened handkerchief towards Ian.\nContinuously dodging, Ian replied, \"I'm going to take a shower as soon as I get inside and unpacked anyway. And where is Dad?\"\nThe undertow accompanying the change in subject struck Kay in waves and delayed her instincts. \"He's in the garage working on some wood. At this rate, he'll be deaf in five years. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night only to hear the whining of his band saw. I think the sawdust is killing brain cells.\"\n\"Can I go see him?\" Ian questioned to put an end to her barrage of meaningless banter.\n\"If you really want but you won't be able to get much out of him. If you don't have a mahogany complexion, you're not worth talking to, or so he seems to think.\"\n\"Is the garage door unlocked?\" Ian asked impatiently.\n\"Yes,\" Kay concluded with a sigh.\nIan escaped from the senseless display of maternal affection and spousal differences to hustle into the garage where his father was, as Kay had declared, working on more wood.\nAlthough Dick's back was to him, he could clearly see him sawing intricate curves into a plank of mahogany. His head was bent over as his arms worked back and forth with motions that seemed instinct. Ian worked his way through the garage, dodging randomly placed saws and piles of wood, until he stood directly in front of his father, only the saw separating them. \"Hey, Dad,\" he shouted over the buzz of the saw.\nDick glanced up from his work, his eyes glowing from behind bulky goggles, and turned off the saw. When the hum of mechanics finally faded into the atmosphere, Dick removed his goggles and wiped the sawdust from the bridge of his nose. \"Hello, Son.\" Refusing to show any affection towards his son, Dick turned on his heels and strode to the other side of the garage, wiping sawdust from his clothes as he went. Without speaking another word to his son, he stepped into the house through an already open door.\nIan quickly ran around saws to make his own way into the house, closing the door behind him. \"Same old Dad, huh?\"\nDick grunted from his reclined position on the couch and picked up the remote control from the cushion beside him. Without a second thought, he clicked on the television, turned it up to a deafening level, and ceased to blink.\nIan, used to the lack of animation, turned to the stairs and began the all too familiar climb to his old bedroom.\n\"Son?\" Dick called from his place on the couch, his eyes never leaving the flickering screen of highlighted blues and greens.\nIan quickly backed down the stairs and peeked his head out from behind the wall that separated the steps from the living room. \"Yes?\"\n\"You have two holes in your neck.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\nDick, blindly, pointed to the right side of his neck and repeated in the same monotone voice, \"two holes, your neck.\"\nAfter staring at his father for another dull moment with confusion, he proceeded up the stairs and into the first door on the right at the plateau of the second level.\nIan stared into the bathroom mirror, his index finger tracing his neck, fingertips dipping into two small bores on his neck.\n\"In a nutshell, you're dead.\"\n\"Dead?\"\n\"Clinically, yes.\" Dr. Bennett backed away from the examination table and tucked his metal clipboard under his arm. He reclined back against the counter scattered with test results and not yet discarded needles, and removed his thin-framed glasses. Instinctively, he raised a gloved hand to stroke the ridge of his nose.\n\"How do you figure?\" Ian asked tersely.\nWith his eyes closed and his fingers continuing to massage the sinus points on his nose, the doctor replied through continuous sighs. \"You have no heartbeat, no living blood cells, and your brain is completely inactive. All of your major organs have been inactive for the past thirty-six hours.\"\n\"And you've seen this before?\"\n\"No,\" the doctor managed through a chuckle, \"No. I can't say that I have.\"\n\"And how do you suggest I,\" Ian began to ask before pausing. \"Bring myself back to life?\"\n\"Shouldn't there be some kind of specialist for this?\" Bennett asked more to himself than to the other occupant of the examination room.\n\"I can't just keep going like this, can I? I'm bound to die sooner or later.\"\n\"You can't get much deader than you already are,\" the doctor said while allowing a second chuckle to escape his tensed body.\n\"Well, what should I do now?\"\n\"I'd suggest calling the burial parlor and setting up an appointment.\"\nIan sat with a stone face while his doctor doubled over with laughter, his own wit too much for him.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Bennett confessed while wiping tears from the corners of his eyes. Once he had cleared his throat and placed his glasses back on his nose, he pulled his clipboard back out from under his arm and began to flip through the pages attached under the metal clip, scrutinizing each.\n\"You have an anecdote in there, doc?\"\n\"My only suggestion to you is to keep out of the sun. It makes the body decompose faster.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Ian mumbled sarcastically as he rose and grabbed his hat from the examination table. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\"So, how did you find me?\" the shadowed figure questioned as he stepped out from a darkened corner of the room.\n\"People,\" Ian lied, not wanting to spoil the stranger's tough aura with the fact that he had seen his business card at the SaveMart.\n\"Are you ready for the lesson?\" The stranger's voice was unusually deep and cracked with each new syllable. He couldn't see the man's face but he sounded excruciatingly old.\nIan nodded stiffly.\n\"Then let us go.\" The stranger swirled what must have been a black cape and threw it over his forearm, keeping it off of the floor and out of his way so he didn't wind up on his face.\nIan followed the cloaked man from the abandoned house that had been provided on the business card. It was a three-story mansion with each of the windows boarded over. The front door had been dead bolted numerous times but the stranger had been quick to open it when Ian had rapped his hand against the hard wood.\n\"Be glad you came to me when you did,\" the stranger began as they strode down the street, all of the streetlights mysteriously burnt out. \"A couple more days and you would have wished you were alive again.\"\nIt shouldn't have come as a surprise that Ian did wish he were alive again. Every bit of food he tried to eat made him nauseous, his skin had begun to burn in the daylight all too easily, and he suddenly came down with migraines each time he walked through his mother's living room, her virtual shrine for Jesus Christ. A large bronze crucifix had been nailed to the wall beside the window and framed pictures of Jesus lined the walls. A stranger to the house would think Jesus was buried beneath the creaking wood planks of the floor.\n\"The first thing you need to learn in order to survive is feeding.\" Before Ian could get in a word edgewise, the stranger leading him through the charcoal streets stopped a bypassing woman.\n\"Excuse me, ma'am. Can you tell me the way to the nearest pharmacy?\"\n\"Why certainly.\" The woman spun on the high heels of her black shoes and began to point back in the direction she had come from, her lips flapping perpetually as they gave muddled instructions. The stranger joined his hands behind his back and stood behind her, peering over her right shoulder as he nodded considerately at her directions. As she continued to point, nod, and mumble, the stranger's eyes left the street ahead where the woman pointed and stared down at the woman's revealed neck. Ian didn't have time to protest or warn the friendly lady before the stranger sunk his gleaming fangs into her neck. Her pointing arm dropped to her side and her mumbles turned into frantic gasps for air. Her body paralyzed and her knees gave way from beneath her, rivulets of blood staining the color of her white blouse. The stranger slid his hands under her shoulders and gently lowered her to the ground. She immediately fell back and grasped at the side of her neck, the crimson raindrops flowing from between her white knuckles. Her mouth stretched open in a silent scream as blood began to gurgle up from her throat.\nThe stranger laughed and backed away. \"She's a real live one, Ian. I haven't had a guzzler like this in months.\"\nPeeling his shocked eyes away from the woman lying dying on the sidewalk, Ian shot a glare at the stranger, which was supposed to be of aid to his situation. \"This is what I came to be taught?\"\nThe stranger turned quickly, his cape fanning out in a broad sweep. His brow was contorted sharply and his eyes glowed red in the cold of night. \"This is how we survive, Ian,\" he spat with contempt. \"Would you rather die?\"\n\"But I am dead,\" Ian argued, his frantic eyes darting back and forth from the stranger and the woman now quivering on the sidewalk. Ian glanced helplessly around, hoping to see someone else walking the streets, but everything was locked up tight.\n\"It's novices like you that really piss me off. You don't understand the gift we have been given. You're not dead. You are immortal.\"\nIan found himself panicking, tears threatening to break through the corners of his eyes. \"I never asked for this.\"\n\"None of us did,\" the stranger scoffed. \"But I am fortunate to have had it happen. I would have died four hundred years ago were it not for this blessing. I would have never witnessed this sudden growth in the Lord's kingdom.\"\n\"The Lord's kingdom? This is not of the Lord's doing!\"\n\"Why can't you grasp this concept? You are now one of Satan's plebeians.\"\nIan bit down on his lower lip in deep thought, sharp fangs penetrating the skin and drawing hot blood.\n\"I see you are hungry,\" the stranger said in a calmer tone. \"She lies waiting.\"\nIan glanced down at the woman, which had fallen still and silent, her eyes only half open. The blood from his lip flowed into his mouth and tasted like ambrosia. He sucked on the wounds and swiped his tongue across the ripped flesh.\n\"Do not deny your lust. Feed.\"\nThe word echoed in his mind.\nFeed.\nHis stomach growled and his throat moaned, the sweet taste of his own blood still pasted onto the roof of his mouth.\nShe lies waiting.\nIan crouched down beside the helpless victim, her chest still rising in jerky patterns. The smell of her blood wafted into Ian's nostrils sending him into frenzy. His eyes flashed and his nostrils flared. All hesitancy gone, he leaned over his prey and applied his lips around the still fresh wound. Immediately, blood flowed into the hollow of his mouth. His tongue swirled madly over the deep penetrations in her neck, hungrily sucking out each ounce of blood.\nAs he continued to lap at the fading victim's neck, he felt the cold hand of his professor rest on his shoulder.\n\"Stop, child. She must live.\"\nIan shot his head up at the final three words, his mind rotating on its rusted axis. Blood dripped off of his chin and onto the face of the victim he had just devoured the life of so callously. \"Live?\"\n\"Yes, even we have morals.\"\n\"What was so moral about attacking me?\"\n\"The vampire who attacked you was clearly an invalid.\"\n\"An invalid?\"\n\"Not only do we have morals, but we have a classification. Some revellers refuse to become a member and go about feeding on whoever they please. Apparently, you were just the closest vulnerable target at the time.\"\n\"Am I an invalid?\"\n\"Until you become registered, yes.\"\nIan let a short laugh escape his lips and shook his head. \"This must be a joke. A guild of vampires?\"\n\"It is no joke,\" the stranger retorted, his eyes threatening to glow a second time. \"The guild, as you call it, is a way to keep a check on everyone we can. We try to keep all of the invalids off of the surface but find that it is rather difficult.\"\n\"Off of the surface?\"\n\"We tend to bury them alive.\"\n\"And that kills them? I've never heard of bur-\"\n\"It doesn't necessarily kill them,\" the stranger interrupted. \"But by the time they dig themselves out of a twenty foot hole, they're quite willing to adhere to common policy.\"\nIan glanced back down at the woman lying on the sidewalk and rubbed his temples, his lust gone but his stomach painfully full. With his tongue, he could feel that his fangs had dulled to their regular shape.\n\"Come, son,\" the stranger said, throwing an arm around Ian's shoulder and pulling him away from the feeding scene. \"We have many more lessons you must learn before you begin to survive on your own.\"\n\"And the woman?\" he inquired, looking quizzically over his shoulder.\n\"Her wounds will heal.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The ashtray was sitting on top of his Olympia upright typewriter and if he didn't empty it soon, it would crack from the heat and spew burning embers into the typewriter well.\nWhat difference did it make?\nHe had been sitting at the desk in his living room like this since he got home from work and now it was four o'clock in the morning. F. Scott Fitzgerald had said that in a true dark night of the soul, it was always three o'clock in the morning. But he was wrong. Sometimes it was two o'clock in the morning. Sometimes it was four.\nPeople in general were just as wrong about writer's block. They thought it meant that you just sat hour after hour staring at a blank white sheet of paper jutting out from under your typewriter roller, waiting for an idea that never came. The truth was that he had hundreds of ideas, more ideas than he could possibly use in a lifetime, but none of them meant anything to him. He would halfheartedly try to develop one of them, because he had a deadline to meet and he had to do something, but in a minute or two he'd panic - maybe he should be working on a different one instead. He'd try that for a while, but then he'd worry that perhaps he shouldn't have dropped the first one. Inevitably, a third idea would seem more attractive. And then a fourth. And then it was four o'clock in the morning and all he had to show for his hours of fits and starts was the traditional overflowing wastepaper basket.\nThe trouble was that he couldn't feel anything and so he couldn't get involved with anything, even his own thoughts. His head felt like a gigantic block of ice and he didn't know how to melt the ice so that the wheels in his brain would start turning again and his emotions flowing. He had written radio spots before - why couldn't he do it now?\nIt was like falling asleep. You didn't know how you did it; you just did it. But when you couldn't do it, when you just lay in bed hour after hour making patterns out of the water stains on the ceiling in the faint glow from the streetlight outside, and tried to fall asleep, you couldn't. And you felt as though you'd never be able to fall asleep again.\nJust as Hank now felt that he'd never be able to write again.\nAnd if he couldn't write, life wasn't worth living.\nHe had tried free associating on paper, just mechanically spewing out whatever came to his mind. Usually after ten or fifteen minutes, or an hour or two, something worthwhile would appear on the surface of this monotonous detritus, like a diamond (or at least a zircon) in a landfill. But not this time.\nHe had considered taking a nap, on the theory that something might occur to him as he slept. And even if not, he'd at least wake up refreshed. But after five minutes of lying like a corpse on a mortuary slab, he had jumped up and gone back to his typewriter. He couldn't sleep because he was afraid to let a second of irretrievable time slip away.\nHe knew, too, from past experience, that if he did something to distract his mind - anything, wash the kitchen floor, sew buttons on his shirts, clean out his desk, go for a walk - something might pop into his mind.\nBut he had to have something, anything, to present to his boss at 9:00 this morning. He couldn't just walk in empty-handed and say he couldn't think of anything. So he didn't dare waste the precious hours left before he had to get ready for work.\nAnd yet, if he had taken a nap at midnight or gone for a walk, he'd have been no worse off than he was now. Only he had no way of knowing that at midnight. And now it was four o'clock and time seemed to be slipping away even faster than before, like the last few grains of sand in a hourglass.\nEven if he could, by some miracle, present the head of his ad agency with an acceptable radio spot, it was probably too late already. He had been fired from four jobs in the last two years for just this, the inability to produce, and he would probably be fired from this one too. Then there'd be thirty-nine weeks of unemployment compensation while he tried to find another job (\"Why did you leave your last position, Mr. Morgan? Why have you had so many jobs in the last two years?\"). And then - because jobs for advertising copywriters had steadily been drying up in Philadelphia since he graduated from Central High School ten years ago - his old standby, telephone sales. Turning himself into a zombie and mechanically reciting a spiel for a product that he was just as disinterested in as his prospects. And being canned even from that demeaning job because he was really too introverted to be a salesman.\nAnd then what? How do you explain to friends and relatives that you can't keep a job because you can't think anymore, can't feel anymore, can't write anymore? Already he dreaded their concerned- turning-to-impatient reactions: What's wrong, Henry? Pull yourself together, Henry. Mind over matter, Henry.\nBut don't you understand, he wanted to scream at their well- meaning faces with their well-meaning fixed smiles, I'm scared. I'm so scared all the time and I don't even know what I'm scared of. And I'm so tired.\nIt was all so hopeless. He wished he could leave for work now, face Don Jackson, get fired and then be out on the street again, and it would all be over. And he'd never have to spend another night like this, trying to write when he was too tired and too goddamned scared. What a relief it would be never to have to wrack his brain again for words that wouldn't come.\nWas this the rest of his life? The accelerating terror, the downward spiral, the eternal exhaustion? Where would it end - in the gutter, in the Delaware River?\nHe wished he could somehow see into the future and see what he'd be like twenty or thirty years from now. But even if he could, he'd probably be too afraid of what he might see to look.\nOh, God, he didn't want to have to live through years, decades of this. Oh, God, please don't do this to me anymore. Please. Let me go to sleep - I'm so tired - and never wake up again. Please, dear God. Please.\nHe felt a little more peaceful, as though asking God to take his life had lifted a heavy burden off his shoulders. He folded his arms across his chest, closed his eyes and let his head slump forward, as though he would slip as effortlessly into death as he had once, long ago, been able to slip into sleep.\nHe dreamed he was sitting right here, in front of his typewriter, fast asleep, when someone started knocking on his apartment door.\nBecause this was a dream, it never occurred to him to wonder who would be coming to see him at four o'clock in the morning. All things are possible in a dream.\nThe man in the black raincoat standing in the hallway was old enough to be Hank's father, although Hank's father had been dead for several years now. He was about Hank's height, but heavier, flabbier. His unusually long grey hair made him look like a Nineteenth Century composer, Wagner or Chopin.\nHis face was so familiar that Hank almost called the man by name, except that no name came to mind. He reminded Hank a little of his father, but more of his Uncle Ben, also dead. And, oddly, of his older brother, Sam, who had hanged himself when he was in high school and Hank was still in elementary school.\nThe man had been examining him intently. Now he stepped into the living room and looked around as though he had just walked into a re-creation of an exotic setting, like the medieval rooms in the Philadelphia Museum of Art or the Japanese house in Fairmount Park.\nHe touched the typewriter lovingly, as you would a beautiful sculpture.\n\"I haven't seen one of these in years. I use a computer now.\"\nHe picked up the ashtray of still smoldering butts and emptied it out an open window.\n\"I used to do that all the time and once spent hours cleaning up the mess after the ashtray cracked apart. I almost set the whole place on fire.\" He put the ashtray on the windowsill. \"I gave up smoking years ago, you'll be happy to hear.\"\nNext he went to Hank's bookcase - actually battleship-grey steel shelving from Korvettes - and examined his books. He pulled out Hank's favorite novel, Marquand's Point of No Return, and as he flipped through it, he smiled.\n\"Do you mind if I take this back with me? I gave my copy away to someone a long time ago and now it's out of print.\" His voice sounded hauntingly familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, like your own voice on a recording.\nOrdinarily, Hank would not have given away one of his treasures, especially to a stranger, but since this was a dream, he nodded.\nThe man tucked the book under his arm, as though he were afraid that otherwise he might leave it behind, and looked around the room once more in wonder.\n\"I still can't believe I'm here,\" he said.\nHe turned to face Hank.\n\"I can't believe it's you.\"\nHank had been dumbstruck through all this, as often happens in a dream. Now he asked, \"Who are you?\"\n\"Do you mind if I sit down? I've been traveling a very long time.\"\nHank nodded. The man perched on the edge of the sofa and Hank sat facing him on the spindle-back chair in front of his desk.\nThe man ran his hand along the brown tweed-covered cushion beside him.\n\"They sure don't make them like this anymore...Hank.\" He said the name tentatively, as though he weren't sure how it would sound. \"You'll never know how strange it feels calling you that. I used to be called Hank too when I was your age.\"\nThe man ran his hand along the cushion again. The hand was delicate, like Hank's, only thicker. Also like Hank, and his father, he didn't wear any rings.\n\"I came here to tell you something that I know you won't believe. But I have to tell you anyway. I came here to tell you that everything's going to be all right.\"\n\"Everything?\"\n\"Everything you're scared about.\"\n\"You mean I won't be fired?\" His heart leaped up in spite of his conscious desire to be canned and get it all over with.\n\"No. You'll be fired tomorrow. And you'll be fired from your next job too. You're going to go through years and years of hell before you get your act together.\"\n\"Get my act together?\" Hank echoed uncertainly. He didn't understand what the man meant by that.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"How do you know all this?\"\n\"I've been through it all already, Hank. All the times I asked God to take my life, the few times I tried to do it myself - I'm so glad now nothing happened. That's what I wanted to tell you, Hank - grit your teeth, you'll make it too.\"\nThe man put Point of No Return on the sofa beside him and stood up.\n\"There's something I'd like to do before I go. You probably won't understand it, but it's something that someone did to me when I was your age and it helped me get through a lot of tough times.\"\nHank stood up too, feeling a little wobbly in the legs.\n\"What?\" he asked unsteadily.\n\"I want to hold you for just a minute. I want to tell you how much I love you, Hank, how much I've always loved you. And I want to assure you that everything's going to work out in the end.\"\nHank had never been held by another man, even his father. Normally he would have been embarrassed and backed away in terror. But in this dream he was having it somehow seemed all right. So he walked into the man's arms and let himself be held like a baby. And, for the first time in as long as he could remember, he wasn't scared anymore.\nAfter a moment the man let his arms drop to his sides. He picked up the book, tucked it under his arm again and turned back to Hank.\n\"I'll be waiting for you.\"\n\"Who are you?\" Hank asked.\n\"You.\"\nWhen he woke up, Hank automatically did what he always did: he lit up a cigarette. When he went to throw the match into the ashtray, it wasn't on the typewriter, where he had left it.Serial: Friend, part 2 \u00a9 1998 Tony Chandler\nThe Story so Far: In 2188 Theodore Edwards is the sole survivor of an explosion on the maiden exploration voyage of the Uluru. An alien ship draws alongside the crippled vessel, and Edwards is captured by its crew. Unable to communicate with them, he is wounded by their experimentation, but cannot express his hurt. At last, Edwards is alone with one of the aliens and attempts to establish a bond of communication between them. The attempt is not entirely successful, as the alien retreats with some alarm.\nDay Six\nThey let me out today.\nI was surrounded by several of the little buggers who pointed this ridiculous little tube at me. I started to laugh, but thought better about it, it probably holds a tiny thermonuclear device. I made sure that I didn't scare them with any sudden moves. Besides, this would be my first visit to one of their places. Away from my circle room prison.\nI also recognized one for the first time. They still all look alike to me, but this was the one who had sat with me yesterday for a couple of hours. I recognized him because one of his seven arms is shorter than the rest and he does not seem to use it as much as the other six. Other than that, they all look black and weird and round.\nWalking basketballs.\nThey must not see in color. Because their world has no color. Every object I see, or the glimpses I get out of round windows shows me that everything is black or white or some shade of gray. My biggest insight into how they see came when we got to the testing machine. At least that's what I call it\nIt filled an entire wall. It was all black with thousands upon thousands of small knobs and holes that filled it's surface while at about the height of that globular mass on their heads there were these gray windows of some kind. Off at one side were some steps which led to another level and then I noticed the narrow shelf where they could obviously walk and work more of the knobs and look into more of the gray plastic-like windows.\nThey motioned for me to go towards one of the windows. I carefully sat down cross-legged, ready and willing to try my hand. I was ready, Theodore Edwards, reprentative of the human race. And I have always been a fast learner. I would show them the semblance of intelligence they were obviously seeking to test me for.\nAnd then I looked into one of the gray windows.\nThey must see more depth than we do. I could see into this window, sort of like looking into a hologram. But there were no dials or indicator lights or anything I could recognize. Different strange shapes seemed to wind around inside. On the curved contours of these shapes were shades of grays as well as short lines that went in all directions. There seemed to be no order to it at all. There were no rows of markings, there were no columns. It was all haphazard.\nI felt my mouth drop.\nI then watched as my friend from yesterday came and stood beside me, eye to globular mass ( the tube weapon was still pointed at my back by another of them). He then took all seven of his arms and either grasped one of the curved, oblong knobs, or poked the tip into one of the tiny dark holes.\nHe hummed at me and then began to work the tips of his arms, several of them simultaneously at times. He leaned his mass towards the gray holo-windows.\nIt began to change almost instantly. The contour sides of the largest shape swelled and shrank with his movements while the gray colors faded or darkened and the lines changed as well. It was almost as if they were alive and breathing, this gentle swelling along with the subtle changing of grays.\nThen he stepped back and pointed his seven arms at me.\n\"You're kidding me, aren't you Mr. Basketball?\" I said unbelievably.\nAll of them began to hum together.\nI suddenly hummed angrily back at them shaking my head a bit, and they all went silent. A couple of the guards raised their tiny killer tubes back at me.\nRaising my hands with a sigh, I reached over and grasped one of the knobs with my forefinger and thumb while I inserted three fingers of my left hand into the dark holes. It was warm inside them and there seemed to be some kind of rubbery mass in them. As I twisted my fingers the picture changed inside the holo-window. I turned the knob very slowly at the same time.\nThe curving contours changed drastically as most of the varying shades of grays went toward either end of the black\/white spectrum. The changes were sudden and jerky.\nI grasped another knob and poked some more of the holes to varying depths. This went on for a long time. The aliens barely moved and remained completely silent, only the mulitude of short rubber like appendages waved.\nI wish I knew what the object to this test was. I tried to bring the picture back to it's original form, but it only got worse and worse. No matter how gently I twisted the knobs or gingerly poked the holes, I could not bring back the original shapes I had first seen, much less the variety of grays. There had been such a confusion of line markings that I just ignored them.\nIt finally ended up that two of the shapes were opposite semi-circles with gray objects and line markings, plus some pure black and white objects, and the third contour shape was now a thin ellipse with hardly any features at all. I turned back to my hosts.\nI think I felt their disappointment.\nAnd Failure.\nThey led me back to my prison in silence, not even pointing the little tubes as I walked along dejectedly with my head down. As I stooped through the circle door I collapsed onto the floor. Rolling onto my back, I stared silently at the curved ceiling for a long time.\nThat's when I became aware of the pain again. I am thinking that whatever pain-killer they had applied to me must have worn off.\nI am constantly blowing blood clots out of my nose and my sinuses feel like they are on fire. The swelling on my face and around my eyes has finally subsided though the skin still is inflamed. My head aches too.\nI decided to write this.\nA few moments later I realized that I was not alone. My peg-armed friend had again squatted near the door and was watching me. The mechanism for the door must be very silent, or I was preoccupied with my wounds. It took me a long time before I could motivate myself to write this entry and take another meal from my food packets.\nI think I may be here a long time with no one to talk to.\nI wish I was back in the land of the Roo.\nDay Seven\nFunny. They let me alone today to rest. Or maybe they have just given up on me, figuring I'm too stupid by their standards. I will try to relax and think, trying to figure another way to communicate with them. I am intelligent, and they are. There is a way, and I will...\nNo, they have come again. Another chance at the testing machine. Well, here goes nothing. I will watch more closely this time. I must learn!!! I have to talk with them. I must explain to them that they hurt me. I must succeed.\nThey just brought me back.\nI tried so hard...\nDay Eight\n\"Hello friend.\" I said out loud.\nMy friend, Stubby is what I have decided to call him, has come again to sit with me in silence. He doesn't say much, but then again, I don't hum much either.\nI have had another idea.\nWriting out the alphabet again, I have just pointed to each letter and sounded it out, all the way through to Z. I even sang my abc's again just like in grade school. Same old mute basketball reaction, though. Then I handed the sheet towards in disgust when he still didn't make any move.\nSurprisingly he reached out with two of his arms and grasped the paper. He rattled the paper first, and then he took a third arm and brushed first one side of the paper and then the other. Finally he brought the paper close to first the globular eyes and then he put it against some of the short, wavy rubber appendages and rubbed it again.\nThen he got up and left.\nIt is now late and I am tired again. I had been hopeful, but now hope is again fading. I don't know how much of this I can stand. I have begun speaking out loud to myself. I wonder how long it will be before I begin to answer myself?\nI wish I were smarter.\nDay Nine\nStubby brought me back an answer.\nIt was even on a flat surface. But as he handed it to me and I looked down, it looked more like psychedelic art than a message.\nThere were several layers of something like paint on the surface. Lines and spirals as well as varying shades of gray came through some of the layers, while other layers had obvious ridges and slopes that I could feel as I ran my finger over them.\nI began to laugh as I covered my eyes. Tears began to trickle onto my cheeks.\nThen Stubby left and brought back a larger writing pad. It is sort of like a white plastic. Then he quickly left and brought back some small jars of with varying shades of gray paint.\nHe encircled a short straight object with the tip of his arm and dipped it inside one of the jars. Sometimes he would use the tip of his pen, at others he would use it long ways. And then he handed it to me.\nI just stared down at it all feeling helpless and lost. But I had to do something.\nSo I quickly grabbed a couple of the jars that had the darkest colors and splashed them onto the pad.\nStubby backed up suddenly. I was afraid he might leave but he hesitated as his curiosity got the better of him.\nI took my hands and smeared it all over until it was almost black. It took only a few seconds for it to dry.\nThen I took some of the lighter colors and poured some of the contents out onto the floor so I could mix them in the jars. I started swearing out loud when I couldn't get it close enough to yellow. But it was as good as it was going to get.\nIn the very center I drew the sun. At least that is what I intended it to be. Then I mixed some other different colors and painted first Mercury, Venus, Earth -I mixed more colors and tried to imitate the cloud over the blue water- and then I went and painted the other planets. I did my best work with Jupiter and Saturn, highlighting the cloud bands of Jupiter and the wide rings of Saturn. Not only was it colorful, but as I ran my finger against the dry surface I could feel the picture as well.\n\"Home.\" I told him as I pointed first to Earth and then pointed to the entire solar system.\nI handed it to him excitedly.\nHe took it and headed out at once.\nAnd then the circle door opened. There were many of them that quickly stepped inside as Stubby stepped out. They had that spray again in their arms and I saw some of the instruments behind them. They wanted to do another probing session.\nI jumped back and shouted at them. I screamed at the top of my lungs. Picking up some of the food packets, I threw them at them. They began to move around in jerky motions, their arms and appendages waving wildly. But still they came.\nI jumped forward and pushed one of them down as his spindly legs collapsed. High pitched shrieks began as the others backed away. The one down at my feet began to shudder, and then using his arms and legs, he crawled slowly towards the others who waited just outside the circle door.\nNo one has come now for a long time. I am afraid to go to sleep. Afraid that they will come in and spray me while I'm asleep and do it to me again.\nFor the first time I wish that I had died back on the ship.\nDay Eleven\nI am on display, like some third-rate freak in the side show.\nThey got me while I dozed off on the second night.\nI am inside a small container enclosed on all sides by something like heavy plastic. The floor is about three feet off of the ground so that their globs can see right up at me. A soft glow comes from the ceiling while the floor also emits the same light. I have more food packets from the ship as well as my pen and notepad. I am sitting here looking out at them.\nSometimes I hope that they have put me out here so that they can get more opinions on how to communicate with me. At other times, when I'm feeling down, I believe that one of them is getting rich putting me out on display and charging entrance. Or perhaps I have just absolutely failed their tests and so they figure I am not sentient. Maybe they imagine that I was some kind of 'pet' that survived from the Uluru\nI have seen children for the first time. Actually, they look exactly like adults only smaller. I have seen some walking rapidly between the legs of an adult as small as six inches around and no more than that tall. It is a wonder that they don't get stepped on and crushed.\nI have also seen my first evidence of a greeting, or some kind of pattern that they perform upon meeting one of their kind. Going up close to each other, first one of them takes all seven of it's arms and cups them around the globular mass on top of their round bodies. It looks like they caress there a little bit. And then the other one will repeat this gesture to him. It may be a greeting or some show of affection.\nI can see many things in the distance out here in the open from my cage. Oddly curving buildings, all black naturally, and small moving vehicles that following winding paths throughout the town.\nBut this seems to be a very watery planet. I can see that in three directions there is a network of dams and dikes holding back wide bodies of water. I do not see any running water nearby. Strange.\nMany days have passed and I am still out here on display. I did not eat yesterday, I didn't feel like it. Depression has enveloped me completely, and blinds me. I am tired all of the time and my shoulders ache. Sitting in one corner of my cage, I stare out at the endless lines of aliens as they stare back at me.\nI am a failure to the human race.\nLooking into the future, I see only pain and loneliness and failure. Failure...\nMy friend is back. Stubby just now appeared outside the clear sheen of my prison. I waved at him and smiled. All he did in return was move those little rubber appendages as they always do.\nI put my hand against the warm clear plastic just now. He took the tips of five of his arms and touched my finger tips with them. We are friends, he and I.\nI just wish I could talk with him. I would feel I had been a success if I could just teach them one word or communicate to them that I am an intelligent being. It is just that we are different. We see the world differently, we look different, we talk differently, and we obviously think along different lines as well.\nI recognize that they are intelligent. But somehow I have failed to show them that I, or we, are. I failed their tests miserably, I feel it in my bones.\nI laugh sometimes at the alien children. Their movements are quite rapid compared with the adults and I have seen them trip up more than a few adults. It seems the children are tougher than I thought and it is the adults who have to be careful of the little buggers!\nIf only I could do something to show them that I am an intelligent being. But how can I, trapped in this cage?\nI may be dying.\nI have been bitten by some kind of animal that swims in the water. My body is completely numb from the waist down, and the numbness seems to be spreading.\nStubby is with me. But let me relate how this happened.\nAnother day had dawned, just like the other days. I had eaten a little and then stood up so they could get a good look at me that morning.\nAnd then everything was shaking. I thought I heard something like a loud thunder clap as well, but I can't be sure. The hundreds of aliens crowded around my cage began to run around in circles, obviously in a panic. As I tried to stand, I felt and heard another rumbling.\nIt was a flood of water from one of the dikes that had broken. Water was soon rushing around the aliens and washing them helter-skelter. I could tell that they were all deathly afraid of the water and could not swim at all in it. Some of them began to drown before my eyes!\nAnd then the children began to disappear, drowning!\nI began beating on the plastic barrier. Stubby, who was up on a platform beside my cage, was waving his arms and appendages in fright as he saw the catastrophe developing.\nI knocked loudly to get his attention.\nHe looked up at me whereupon I pointed to myself and then to the drowning children. He understood.\nCrawling over to a small black box, one of the plastic barrier quickly disappeared. I jumped out into the now raging current of the flood. It rose almost to my waist but no more, but the current was a hard dragging pull.\nWading as quickly as I could, I reached a group of five children who were hanging precariously to a small tree-like plant. I gathered them into my arms and then waded quickly back to my cage and put them in. The water was getting no higher and they would be safe there now. But the current was still too much for their spindly legs and arms. One child disappeared just before I reached it. I screamed out loud as I searched under the water, but I could not find it.\nI saw some more and saved them. More and more I reached. But I also saw many go under and not rise back up. My heart was beating like an engine as I fought back my tears.\nI would save them. I could do this.\nAnd then I realized that there were things in the water.\nI felt one brush by my leg. I think they were eating the aliens. Kicking out savagely at the large serpentine bodies, I tried to race to save more of my friends. Grasping them by their arms, legs or anything I could get my hands on, I held them above the waters and the greedy teeth of the eaters.\nThat is when I began to feel the bites.\nAs soon as I had put one bunch up safely, I would turn and go for more stranded groups. Then I stumbled and fell into the water. My legs were quickly going numb. But I went on. I had to save them. If I did not do it they would die.\nFinally I had done all that I could. I stumbled back with two shivering adult aliens in my arms. We were pulled up by Stubby and some of the other adults.\nI lay in pain. But while the other aliens tended to their own, Stubby stayed with me. He took out a small jar and gave it to me to drink. I think it was medicine. It tasted bad enough to be medicine anyway.\nAnd then he held my hand. Encircling it with several of his arms he held it gently and then began to stoke it.\nIt made me feel good.\nStubby wants me to stop writing. He keeps pushing my writing hand down when I try to write but I have to finish this right now.\nBut something else happened that really touched me. Taking his seven arms he cupped my face and then began to gently rub. It felt good. I think it must be more a sign of affection than a greeting.\nAs I finish for now I feel for the first time that I have shown them that I am intelligent, even though I am different. I repeated the word 'home' to Stubby. He took out some kind of device and held it toward me.\n\"Please take me home when you can. Home. Earth.\" And then I smiled at him. \"You are my friend, Stubby.\"\nThere was some material that he handed me. I grasped it and then I took off my wristwatch. Tying a nice bow around it, I gave it back to Stubby. He tried to give it back. I said the word gift and present. He finally kept it, encircling it with the tips of two arms.\nHe refuses to leave my side even after some vehicles have come and begun taking us to better facilities. Stubby has indicated that he will ride with me.\nI am glad that he is coming. I am so cold, so very cold. But at least I am not alone.\nI will write more tomorrow.\n\"This is Reggie Edwards reporting live from the alien landing site,\" The disheveled man rattled the words off into hundreds of millions of TV sets around the globe. \"As you know, CTNN has interrupted our normal broadcasting to keep you, our viewers, on top of this epoch making event. Less than twelve hours ago the alien ship appeared and passed by the Mars colonies. The Earth military is at Full Alert and is prepared to deal with the alien ship which entered Earth orbit within the past hour.\" He paused to catch his breath as he wiped the sweat off of his forehead. Then he continued his barrage. \"What has United Earth's ruling council so concerned is the shattered remains of the lost ship Uluru. Those mangled remains are affixed to the alien ships hull. It is obvious that the Uluru was attacked and destroyed. Right now, the ruling council is advocating patience until all the circumstances surrounding this attack on our unarmed research vessel can be scrutinized.\nBut now the aliens have landed, I am here with a growing crowd of both reporters, the army, and hundred of civilians. The air is tense...wait, wait, the door is opening...\"\nOn television screens around the world cameras moved into a close-up of the black, gnarled shape of the alien ship. A round door suddenly appeared revealing a dark interior. Suddenly the aliens were there.\nOr rather, alien.\nA single alien carrying a small device in the tip of two of it's arms came out. The device was pointed behind. A round oblong box floated behind it, it was about six feet long and three feet wide. The lone alien carefully directed this last object toward the front of all the other exotic shaped things. He then lowered it gently, until it softly touched the earth. A third arm reached to the side of the last box, which was strangely smooth compared to the others. It opened.\nA dead man was inside.\nAn audible gasp from the before to silent crowds filled the air. And then more aliens came out and stood beside the oblong box.\nThe aliens started to hum. Higher and higher in pitch the sound rose to a crescendo, and then stopped. The lone alien reached to the dead man's face and cupped it with all seven of it's spider-like arms.\nAnd then the aliens scurried back to the small ship. As the last alien, the one who had brought the coffin, stood in the dark entrance, he turned and suddenly became very still. He raised one of his black arms, and waved at the crowd of humans.\nThen he was gone.\nSilently the ship returned to the skies and was out of sight in a matter of moments.\nTwo men in uniform quickly approached the corpse. They took out instruments from the wide belts at their waists and scanned the objects, especially the dead man. Then they nodded.\nMore people in uniform ran forward, starting their inspections. And then one reached to the dead man's hands and removed a green notepad. He flipped through it rapidly, until he got to the last page. His commander stepped beside him.\n\"What is it Jones?\"\n\"A diary, sir. Of the dead man I think.\"\n\"Quick, read the last page, see if he mentions if they were attacked!\"\nThe man swallowed as he read the last paragraphs in the dead man's hand, and then he looked and spoke, his voice a little deeper.\n\"Sir, his last act was in saving alien children. The last entry is in another hand. I think an alien wrote these last words.\"\nThe commander took the notepad from his hands and stared down at the scratchy script of the last two words in the diary.\nFriend Home","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Sunny thoughts splintered the bizarre apparitions that only a while ago she thrashed at trying to fend off.\nShe leaned her head back now and stretched her swan-like neck soaking up the titillating humus of the pool.

It was the end of perihelion, but daylight was still too harsh for the sensitive neurophyte cells.\nGeorgiana drew herself out of the pool and settled on its pulpy edge. She leaned over her reflection and tidied the dripping, shoulder-length strands of black, serpentine hair. The eyes, she regarded, had not tinted notablely. Somba's irides were more perky. They gleamed emeralds in the morning, and at dusk acquiesced to pool-green. How lucky, a mate with such innovative eyes. Yet, tales were around of blue, even brown eyes.\nShe perused over her cheeks, a smidgen of azure upon pallid green cheekbones. The fine contours of her dainty nose accentuated the flare of the nostrils. Below these, two gossamer-thin ridges led to a delicate upper lip and a slightly fuller lower one. Her chin jutted petite, recherche.\nA silly notion piqued her. She brought her little finger up and sucked and feigned the chewing motion in her dream. A kindling charge swirled up her spine. The cheeks blushed cyan and the plumb line of down below her navel-less tummy tingled.\n\"Oh, Green-!\" she gasped.\nChagrined she sprang up and donned her one piece cellular suit. She wandered into the laboratory disturbed by her frivolous experimenting.\nWhen Somba came back there was the smell of sap dew in his suit. He handed her the vessel of chloroplasma and newcells.\n\"How did you sleep?\" he asked.\nShe took it, and turned away. She did not want him to see her preoccupied, \"Very well,\" she said.\nSomba then ambled to the ancient hard-stuff counter and sat on an equally old and scarred stool. He commenced checking the tendrils leading to the terminal before him. Georgiana watched as his elegant hands gently rippled over them, running the length of the pasty-green synapses down to the half-buried cell beneath the counter. He patted the neurophyte and it noticeably bloated to his touch.\n\"Things look fine on our side,\" he said.\nShe responded with a wide grin exposing tender, baby gums.\n\"You've got the cutest smile in all of Cloverfarm,\" he said, then switched the terminal on.\nThe turtle-sized cell below gave a visible kick and burrowed deeper into the soil by flattening its hump allowing dirt around it to fall and cover it completely. Georgiana could picture the cell's fibrous piths boring deeper into the earth, absorbing minerals and converting their neutral charges into ionized elements by stripping electrons and depositing them on the complex root-grid.\nSomba got up. \"Have a try at the old fossil,\" he said, indicating to the machine. \"Just a reminder, no one must know.\"\n\"I promise,\" she said in earnest.\nHer round eyes got bigger with so much conviction in them. He put his arms around her. \"Tonight, in pool, I'll want more than a promise,\" his words came out lisping.\n\"That too....\" she could hardly articulate from her own lisp, and felt herself dilating. She resorted to silently nodding her consent and participation.\nSomba then left for the day and Georgiana felt a wisp of emptiness. But it was only a momentary thing.\nWhile Somba in the day's course consulted at several data archive centers spread throughout Cloverfarm and overspilling beyond into Marshgardens, Georgiana's job was to separate the 'soup' he collected each morning by centrifuging it. The newcells accumulated at the bottom of the container, while the chloroplasma remained on top. After separation, the flee-looking phytogenic cells were dumped onto petri dishes layered with chloroplasma and sifted soil of high nutrient derivation.\nShe would watch over the cultures and replenish the nutrients, till three weeks later the ochres showed. The yellowish-green cells went into stasis conglomerates deep within the freezing caves of Marshgardens where light could not get to them. Their transport there and later their fabrication and construction cultivation was not her responsibility. Hers was only to keep records of quantity and ochre, and to segregate the yellowish-greens from the reddish-greens.\nAs complacent as the y-gs were, their counterparts, the r-gs, effervesced with uneasiness and activity, at times to the point of mischief. At infant stage, the venturous r-gs would quiver with unrest, and some managed - to Georgiana's professional disconcert - to move by a centimeter or more on the mud-layered petris. A scientific improbability since they lacked muscle tissue. Their teensy, watch-spring tendrils served no other purpose than to absorb and catalyze nutriment. Yet, in the years she had been observing them not once had she caught glimpse of the slightest of spacial displacement at its transpiring.\nThe lit terminal flickered and flashed as though calling to her to take prompt notice of it.\nIt was noon by the time she finished her allotted work. She centrifuged all of the sap Somba had brought in. She placed the newcells in the dishes, used 124 in all, discarded the dead or damaged ones, and emptied the fresh pure chloroplasma in their sleeping pool. As she did her eyes remained glued on the swaying flux the falling sap stirred. The new batch worked itself around transforming the pool into clear green glass. Ready for the night, she thought, anticipating, and pulled her eyes away from its twinkling lure.\nReturning to the laboratory she threw a professional glance over the petris arrayed on a shelf grown out of the homogeneous wall, and sat in front of the terminal's monitor. She had turned it off after Somba left. Now she prepared to reactivate it. Only one other time had she felt this way: when she had mistakenly touched the tips of an r-g's hind genitalia tendrils instead of the forward boring pair. It had happened a couple of seasons ago. She would never forget the blinding surge that had rendered her unconscious till Somba came and lowered her into the sleeping pool. Of course the charge expelled was not lethal and defensively triggered by the adult male cell, but enough was there to transpose all the stars in the night sky within her field of vision. It taught her that privacy was a cosmic appanage.\nThe knot in her belly was still there when she flipped the switch and caught sight of the twitch the buried cell gave below. The console brightened and symbols, ignoring her presence, raced through multiple changes on the bright green of the screen.\nGeorgiana did not wait for them to stop. She was familiar with microprocessors from her early apprentice years at Cloverfarm Academy and the Genetics Model Simulation courses. She would have to rely heavily now on the theory that had been taught to, or rather drilled into, her. As her fingers ran over the keyboard, familiar patterns, notes and comments appeared.\n\"Not mulation,\" she felt annoyed at herself, \"mutation kinesis manifestation types - Execute.\" She whispered and spoke to the empty room and the machine, while her long thin appendages tried to reacquire their old dexterity. Text rendered with biogenetic diagrams made its way before her. Then:\nFor unabridged supplements consult the Main Stores Databank of Marshgardens.\n\"Anything worthwhile you have to get from Marshgardens,\" she remonstrated in a tug-o-war with the computer.\nMeanwhile, a vestige of disquiet, piqued her. It wasn't so much that Somba smuggled the antiquated, bulky terminal into their abode, which he'd return in a day or two after she had a go at it. And it wasn't her recurring dream either, or the strange-looking brutal bipeds in it that defied any explanation mottling her efforts to be rid of it once and for all.\nIt was more immediate; somehow connected with the old artifact she faced. A sniped, possibly a clue given by the scurrying information before her, may have caused her agitation. But time nagged.\nShe would not have indefinite access to the terminal. So, Georgiana shrugged off the pricking from inside and set to work. She evoked the supplements from Marshgarden's Main Stores concerning recorded responses of r-g newcells. When the index came up she went over it thoroughly, double-checking each entry.\n\"Mobility, mobility...,\" she mumbled to herself. After a long stretch of time, \"Nothing.\" Eight more indices had similar negative results.\nThe buried cell next to her feet gave a shudder as it adapted to a new, this time concave, shape to allow more soil to trickle around its surfaces insulating it further from encompassing aridity. Georgiana glanced down and with the side of her foot pushed more dirt over it. The cell seemed content and became once more still as though nothing else mattered but its job at hand, breaking down complex molecular chains into simple anions and cations. Georgiana knew that the process was no more demanding to the ensconced neurophyte than that of an amble to a biped.\nShe resumed to the ninth index. But in its place, a blinking monitor sounded with sharp, shrilling protests. Georgiana stiffened. She instinctively jabbed several keys all at once responding to quieten the machine down.\nThe machine did. The penetrating shriek cut off. The blinking screen now flashed a chain of nonsensical alphanumerics, and next to them a yes\/no option.\nShe drew in a deep breath. The sudden commotion started her. A thin wet layer brooded on her forehead and neck. For an instant she had feared of having been discovered.\nShe lingered a while, and punched \"yes\". The screen went blank and half a dozen tiny indicators played havoc with her sight, flickering intense needle-thin lights. She held her breath. The timeworn computer intermittently hummed and whirred as it searched, retrieving - \"What?\"\nIt dawned on her. The alphanumerics she stumbled on were not just gibberish, but an upload code. These primitive generation computers did not carry limiters, narrow-band filters, to suppress all but the job-at-hand program parameters. They had no discretion capabilities, so all that reached them was processed unchecked.\nThe console finally lit up. At the four corners of the screen the word CLASSIFIED flashed in bold letters. Then:\nMain Core Index\nHydroponics Hybrid Assessments\nCrosscloning Essays\nDate: 2000 AD + 346 PVS (HUO)\nA list of topics followed, the last being a glossary.\nThe cross-references for each topic were endless. They ran on page after page. On the twenty-fourth she spotted something resembling her query:\nJ. K. Pietroff and L. P. Ellingsworth\nDiscursive Essay on Effecting Plant Kinesis\nDate: 2000 AD + 402 PVS (HUO)\nShe went through the introduction her brows not stopping an interactive dance to every other line.\n...the tropism from pygmy ferns to giant redwoods. Closer study disclosed that at its infancy, a seedling has been noted to relocate itself to as far as a meter from its original planting site in search of more suited surroundings...\nWhen she was through she looked up fern and redwood in the glossary. The first was a very small quasi-version of the second, while the second - she cowered - grew straight out of the soil to sky-scraping heights.\nGeorgiana paused.\nThe dream came to taunt her once again.\n\"It's true then.\" It relieved and jarred her. But when did these colossi live?\nAD\n: In the year of our Lord.\n\"What year is that?\" she heard herself ask.\nPVS\n: Post Vivarium Syndrome\nThis rang a bell. But it was still too distant to make any practical sense.\nThe paper made references to three other documents. She alluded to the first:\n...\nPlant-Animal Hybriding\nDate: 2000 AD + 409 PVS (HUO)\n...Population drain is rapid. Marginal success, however, reaps unpredictable as yet rewards. The melon-size monocell, among other things, is capable of converting chemicals in the soil to widely adaptable, cheep and unlimited low-voltage emf. Similarly it can transmit and receive transient electrical data through soil strata...\nThe excitement now turned her cheeks to sapphire. She understood most of this.\n\"A-n-i-m-a-l,\" she keyed in.\n: 1. Living being capable of feeling and voluntary motion.\n: 2. Lower animal as distinguished from man.\n\"M-a-n.\"\n: 1. Adult male.\n: 2. Mankind.\n: 3. Human being.\n\"A hu-ing!\" she hissed grimacing.\nThe sight of \"it\" instinctively repelled her - and, yes, \"it\" did have hard bare bones in its jaws to crush and chew. She examined the diagram again and scanned over the information.\n\"Green Chloro!\" surprised still when she thought she could not be. \"It does assimilate raw nourishment through its oral cavity!\" The pores on her started to swell and more droplets of sap gathered on her skin.\n\"HUO\"\n: For Human Use Only.\n\"Why am I looking at hu-ing records? O Somba, where are our own!\"\nNauseous she drew away from the machine, got up and headed for the pool, her color sallow. Phalanges felt empty of sturdy matter and her body drained of strength. She looked down at the sap pool. To submerge in it and savour its vitality. Nourish and replenish herself for Somba. But no, she couldn't, the pool had been purged. The newsap she had emptied into it that morning had revivified it. She could not spoil it selfishly.\nReaching with her hand, she took two handfuls and washed the old sap off her face and arms. She closed her eyes and relished it. She would wait for Somba to arrive and go in then, with him. Meantime, she mustered her courage and energy to approached the green screen again.\n\"Chlorless hu-ings!\" she declared taking her place in front of the monitor and not really understanding her moot, utter repugnance. All they were was a differently evolved life-form, all but extinct now.\nBut what of the Lores and Myths.\nLores from The Testaments of Chloro told of the once infested planet - scourged with poisons.\nThe ancient odes from the Myths bewailed over massive destruction and constant strife among the Denizens, when time was still young, fermented by their fitful and ornery propensity. Legends incanted of their breed having factions warring for complete control of the lands, vast pools called seas, and the air.\nGeorgiana puzzled over why anyone would contend to singly possess such overwhelming expanses. A habitat, a plot of land to grow cells on, work that rewarded your endeavours - and, the stir of simply life itself and its sharing of truths with others - were these not ample?\nThe Denizens, she concluded, had lost control of themselves in their endeavour to control all else. And their imperfection had simulated and emulated, then equalled and exceeded their boldness and dare. A world that must have been so markedly different and wondrous such as she, and her own, had never seen had been contemptuously squandered: the trees, the animals, all of their kind.\nSmidgens of fleeting images now goaded her awareness - she must have been a tender sprout then - of bipeds being shown to her and foreboding words spoken by those that were with her. Stares and fingers had pointed at the biped's oversized, blotted hands - No wonder she was distraught.\n\"T-h-u-m-b.\"\n: Short thick division of the hand opposing the fingers.\nShe studied the diagram and raised her own slim, streamlined hand next to it. How powerfully crewed the other showed, her own slender as her wrist with no offending bulge sticking out at the side. It must have gotten exasperatingly in the way... although, with it, one could grasp things more firmly. But why? Everything around, anything needed was light and soft. Who would want to move mountains when you could grow them, and just about whatever else, with y-gs.\nShe looked over the ancient machine. The long bar-key for spacing was for - thumbs. The missing little helical shafts that fitted in the orifices were probably gyrated by a thumb-supported hand-tool.\nThese discoveries prodded her to place aside her sensitivities and dig deeper.\nHer original query about r-y mobility had been generically answered: being descendants of animal-plant hybrid origins, the light newcells maintained fractional capability of mobility. Their springy infrastructures could be used to hop about in the dark of night when light did not dull their senses.\nStill, at the back of her mind, there were questions unanswered. Why the maelstrom of bustling last-minute hu-ing experiments? And why no mention of her own kind?\nThe computer, the counter on which it rested, the stool she sat on were a legacy of artifacts shrouded in silence. Such hard-stuffs her own species could in no way tool. The hands of her own could mould and manipulate the soft y-g newcells, the building-blocks of her civilization, but never could y-gs be crafted to grow into such complex and granite-hard matrices. The very philosophy, she realized, was extraneous and anachronistic. Her sort did not need hard and intricate implements. The y-gs were yielding and malleable, suited for the fingers to ply and form; and the r-gs provided them with heat at aphelion, and through their deep root networks a means of communicating when necessary.\nAll nutrient substances covered by earth were to their avail through the cells' sap. Ample sap. Some of which ran into the pool directly through hidden and protected latices in the habitat's cultivated structure, while other harvested each day at dawn. Sap cleaned, nourished, removed wastes and fatigue toxins from their bodies; made the males grow fertile pollen and females gestate healthy seeds.\n\"How unwholesome,\" she shuddered, repelled by what she read. It buttressed further the reason of her antipathy - to inseminate and give birth through orifices situated next to waste excretory outlets; so far removed from the epicenter of the clean and sensuous, from the body's temple of love, the - she revered the word - Mouth. To think that such delicate and sentient organ be covered with bony stubs and used for grappling and cleaving hard-stuffs. It was like using the eyes to roll on and the ears to lift burdens with. Hard-stuffs, Georgiana settled, belonged in her world as much as primitive hu-ings.\nShe summoned the list of contents once more. When it emerged she sifted through it till, spent and her eyes raw, she found it.\nHuman-Plant Crosscloning.\nThe security classification was the highest of all so far. The computer thrummed and whizzed as it decoded the incoming data from meaningless machine pulses to legible, processed information.\nShe braced herself as she read.\nShe was well within the treatise when the screen jumped, blinked, and blanked out... blinked suddenly on again to give her another leap-frog start on the stool. But in place of text, a live image filled it.\n\"A hu-ing!\"\nA facsimile of a smile brought her face-to-face with two rows of bare, shiny jaw-extrusions. Quickly the hu-ing pressed lips together, as if aware of the other's discomfort.\nIt looked straight at her with unwavering coolness, as though it waited to be studied, expected it. The right hand - thumb and all - raked back spilling tousles of hair, then over... what must have been hair too, but on its face! Georgiana shivered, but did not avert her scrutiny of this... this relic.\n\"My eyes,\" the hu-ing's raspy voice came, \"are light-blue. Your monitor does not show that.\" There was no trace of lisp, she noted.\nShe tried to imagine the face without the hair but couldn't. The shoulders were broad and the neck and arms thick with exercised muscle. She knew, from her recent endeavors, that the skin would resemble the pale sunsets of solstice. That the epidermal pigments were melanin- and not chlorophyll-based.\nShe now knew that their vital fluid was not purged sap-extract renewed by pore-osmosis, but a composite, a frightfully complex concoction of microzoa and plasma called blood, produced within its body not outside it. Though physically the hu-ing's general shape resembled her own, the physiology differed radically, was incompatible to any life form known to her. Hu-ings prevailed in ambience that would choke her and stiffen the body-fluids of her own kind, starve her species of light and breathable air. No wonder their few remaining habitats were hermetically sealed and beyond any phyto-sapiens' obvious reach. Yet....\nThen the fact pounced on her gouging a vacuum below her feet - and she fell.\n\"The databank you were accessed to? It activates a subroutine that tells us whether the user is cleared or not,\" the hu-ing prattled. \"But it takes a while.\n\"So... Georgiana Adamson, of the Abraham A. Adamson (God bless his soul) culture of 2000 AD + 1053 PVS, you are hereby charged of illegal possession of Commonwealth property and of unlawful ingression upon Classified material, thus besetting your person (and that of your mate) to the travails bequeathed to such contravention...\"\nAgog, she listened.\nThe hu-ing went on-and-on with dire-tone rhetoric and formal reproof, admonishing and reprimanding.\nAfter a spell Georgiana lost herself. Heavy eyelids drooped, and she drifted into a gentle doze.\n\"Are you - I say, are you napping on me!\"\nHer head jerked violently up. She shook it and her eyes blared wide. Loss of sap, anxiety, and a deluge of apocalypses had more than drained her: they reduced her to limpid cellulose. The hu-ing's droning voice had effected the lulling pool sap languidly swaying her to slumber.\nIn her weariness she realised... that she no longer cared.\n\"You made us, and I know it, and it's no longer a secret. I won't tell Somba or anybody else, if that's what you want - but now, please let me rest,\" she gushed out in single breath.\n\"My, we do have a temper.\" The hu-ing said, drawn out of its platitudinous elocution.\n\"Well?\" she grumped.\n\"Well?\" the hu-ing echoed.\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\"Slap your hands-\"\n\"-if we could meet, face-to-face, that is. But as you probably are aware, kinling, that can never be.\"\n\"Kinling?\"\n\"Yes, definitely. Several centuries back your line meets mine. The databank didn't squeal on that now, did it? A strain of our family clones. I'm an Adamson, too.\"\n\"Oh, Green, Greenest Chloro-\"\n\"Crude of me,\" the hu-ing exhibited weariness itself. \"We do look and act like savages, after all...\" The hu-ing rambled on looking elsewhere. \"Our hands - they're the ones that need slapping.\"\nGeorgiana, fatigue ridden, \"You built and maintain the machines and equipment, and us,\" it was an indictment.\n\"Yes... and, no.\" He was looking at her once more, but this time the visage held little snap to it. \"It's we that have made and look after the accoutrements, yes.\" It sucked its lip, \"But, no, Lord no, you have been free and on your own since you could mind after yourselves, hundreds of years now. We haven't tampered with you or your social structure since. And never shall.\"\nHis voice now came out hoarse. \"You see, you were made a step better in the evolutionary ladder. There is no disease for you. No premature death because of it. The sap sees to that. No pain when you regurgitate your tender offshoot, a little discomfort maybe. And without thumbs, your times will be more tranquil, free of industrial \"civilization\" - practically cauterized life out-\"\n\"Cauterized?\"\n\"For us, all hope is lost,\" the hu-ing raved on. \"Living on the outside, beyond the bleak walls of the vivariums, these caves below you, is a coveted, an unreachable, dream - never to set our eye upon a Sun, a Moon, or amble beneath a jewelled sky at night.\n\"No, it's your world, Georgiana. Yours and Somba's and your children's blessed children-\"\n\"You,\" she pointed an unsteady finger at the screen, \"you are the Denizens, the Lores and Myths!\" She was too used up to say more.\n\"The Fallen Angels. Yes. The sum of our greed and callousness. Fated to grope the darkness of Marshgardens' and other cavities in the bowls of Earth, to depend on those of you who know for subsistence and safety, to endlessly query through experiments for a spark of salvation among the ash.\n\"I'd slap your little hands, little sister - and kiss them afterwards.\"\nThe tube went blank.\nGeorgiana rose from the stool and waded to the opening of the door. The evening was brisk for perihelion, the artifact thermometer read a refreshing 163 degrees F.\nIn the distant blaze Somba waved. She waved back. She took long steps toward him letting her lungs inflate with rich carbon dioxide. Already she began to feel strong enough to jump in pool and ravish him.\nPoor, poor hu-ing, her thought interloped to the homely creature, and with a sigh, \"Don't ever venture outside your hole to either slap or kiss me.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Old Seamus really has it coming. And after I've done him, every jack in the city'll cheer. But they won't know which one of us did it. There're too damn many rats in the ranks, these days. Too many duffers who got caught, and who'll snitch for CRAD to stay out of the Camps.\"\nMelissa frowned. \"I wish I could talk you out of this obsession, Mort. I get bad vibes about it. Playing games with someone like Big Mac is dangerous...\" She paused. \"There's somebody down here.\"\nThey listened.\nTHUMP!... The percussive sound from down the corridor was faint, but confirming. It was a warning for the two datajacks who were working in the sallow illumination of the old ceiling-striplite in the grimy basement cableroom.\n\"He's coming this way!\" hissed Melissa. \"Disconnect!\"\n\"As you wish, my little honeybee,\" replied her consort, softly. He unplugged the tapcable which now ran from the small wiretap\/diverter to his handheld computer on the table. He'd wanted to remove the diverter from the cable panel, but he didn't have time to splice the break he'd made for it in the fiber-optic telcom cable before the noisemaker from down the corridor arrived.\nThe telcom cable he'd tapped led upstairs to an apartment occupied by the object of his revenge - a man who was important enough to have AA-1 authorized access to every corner of the Web, but who preferred to live cheaply in this old apartment house in the Northeast Quadrant. With the tap, Mort could now intercept this tenant's coded outgoing ID-data, and program it into his illegal MiniCrackMaster software, Version 9.08, the latest for handhelds.\nProperly programmed, he could then access the Web with the identity of the telcom cable's authorized user, even though he didn't have the guy's PermiPlug. Until he was detected and probed by security software, he could surf to his heart's content - and have his sweet revenge on Big Mac.\n\"Hurry! I feel him strongly, now!\"\nMelissa had a wild talent. She could detect the nearby presence of another human in total darkness, with her eyes shut and her ears and nose plugged. It was a talent she kept secret. The government claimed a proprietary interest in such persons, and \"co-opted\" them into involuntary servitude. Since the short nuclear war, such talents were appearing more frequently in the Terran population.\nMort and Melissa had swiped a couple of old chairs from the tenants's storeroom. They intended to relax in this small basement cableroom, and from here, during early morning when the residents were asleep, jack into the Web with Big Mac's big authorization.\nMort knew he wouldn't be able to tap this cable for very long - just long enough to use the cybercop's super-privileges against him. He and Melissa hadn't quite worked out how they'd do this; they needed a plan for quick and devastating action. For now, Mort needed to test his hookup and sample Big Mac's cyberenvironment. They'd return later for revenge.\n\"In here!\"\nMelissa pulled open the door to a storage closet, an emergency hidey-hole she'd prepared before Mort began tapping into the telcom cable. She'd oiled the door hinges and latch to keep it quiet, in case they had to use it suddenly. Without Melissa's cool common sense - in addition to her wild talent - her boyfriend would have disappeared from the ranks of working datajacks long ago.\nMort carefully pushed the door-flaps of the big cable panel together, unlatched. He grabbed up his handheld, wrapping its tapcable around it as he retreated to the closet. He would have preferred to pull the latch ring and lock the door-flaps together so they wouldn't be seen as open, but he was afraid he'd make a too-loud metallic sound doing it.\nHe joined Melissa in the dark closet, and the two of them dropped to their hands and knees and peered through a vent grille at the bottom of the door.\n\"Oh heck. The chairs,\" bemoaned Mort, in a whisper.\n\"There's no place to put them,\" replied Melissa.\nThey detected the soft footfalls of an approaching intruder - a new intruder, that is. They heard him stop at the open doorway to the cableroom, then enter it. Through the grille, they saw a diminutive, young black boy. He was dressed street-wise in a dirty T-shirt, long shorts, and worn running shoes. On the T-shirt, was a representation of a Zulu warrior with an assegai and shield. On the guy's head and almost pulled over his eyes, was a brown watchcap.\n(\"Thank God,\") thought Mort. He was half-afraid the intruder would be Big Mac armed with a stunner.\nThe new intruder stood in the doorway staring at the chairs - then at the almost-closed cable panel. Noticing its unlocked door-flaps, he walked over and opened them to have a look inside.\nMelissa glanced anxiously at Mort. Sensing her question, he shook his head to say: No - I didn't have time to undo the tap. He shrugged his shoulders in a fatalistic gesture.\nMelissa stared at the intruder. (\"He must be the janitor's son,\") thought the femjack, hopefully. (\"What's he doing up so late?\") The janitor's apartment was on the ground floor. The basement was occupied only by utilities and stored goods.\nThe putative janitor's son began examining the wiretap\/diverter.\n(\"He's spotted the tap,\") both datajacks thought, simultaneously.\nMort's work in the panel had been discovered for what it was - an illegal wiretap of a telcom line. Both she and Mort knew what that could mean for them if they were caught: a miserable year in a Re-ed Camp, or worse.\nMort was a young-man-of-action. He leaped up. From his pocket, he pulled his jackknife, the one he mostly used for wirestripping. He locked the blade and prepared himself for a fight.\nMelissa grabbed his pants-leg to stop him, but he pulled away from her. She arose but didn't follow him as he opened the closed door. He made no effort to be quiet; such an effort would be wasted in the tomblike silence of the basement.\nMort boldly stepped from the closet and faced the intruder's back. The boy seemed to be unaware of Mort's presence behind him, despite the sounds the datajack had made leaving the closet.\nMort stood still, his knife held conspicuously but unagressively in one hand, his handheld still grasped securely in the other. He cleared his throat loudly. Amazingly, the intruder continued to ignore him.\n(\"What the hell?... What's wrong with him?\")\nTension reigned at one end of this dual presence. Mort desperately hoped the intruder wasn't similarly-armed; Mort was no knife spiv. He passed his handheld back to Melissa in the closet. She took it from him. For once, she had no advice for her man. She considered the situation and tried to sort things out, logically. Something was wrong here. The guy at the panel was completely ignoring Mort.\nThe new intruder slammed the door-flaps of the cable panel with a CLANK!... which sounded loud in the quiet basement. He turned to resume his ramble up the corridor - and stopped. Seeing Mort and the knife, his dark face became a mask of alarm. He stood, awaiting a move from the stranger that would send him fleeing.\n\"Do you like my work?\" inquired Mort, his lips curling in a sneer.\nThe boy wrinkled his brow at Mort's question. He made signs with his hands and pointed to his ears.\n\"He's deaf,\" concluded Melissa. She passed the handheld back to Mort and stepped from the closet, around him. With her freed hands, she made signs of reply. The boy responded with a flurry of hand and finger motions, writing his desperate speech in the warm, stale air. The two strangers thus communicated for what seemed to Mort like an eternity. He was unaware of his girlfriend's skill at hand-talk.\nThen, they stopped. The boy continued to stare anxiously at the two newcomers. He took special notice of Mort's handheld - seemingly forgetting about his knife.\n\"Well...?\" asked Mort.\n\"He's a Mem - a memory savant. He's on the run.\" Melissa's blue eyes danced between Mort and the deaf intruder.\n\"He told you that?\" asked Mort, skeptically.\n\"He said he's homeless. He's been hiding here in this basement. I figured out the rest.\"\nMort had long-since learned to depend upon his girlfriend's mental abilities. Her perception of situational reality was very good, and her conclusions rarely wrong.\n\"I'll bet he can recall the color of every cable in that panel,\" she said. \"He probably has a mental picture of the inside that's almost as good as if he were looking at it right now.\"\n\"Big deal,\" commented Mort. \"Can he tap a telcom cable without getting caught, though?\"\nShe signed some more. The boy replied and pointed to his T-shirt and to himself, and made five alphabetic finger-signs.\n\"His name is Chaka. He's named after an ancient Zulu warrior.\"\nMort thought little of this. He folded and stowed his jackknife to demonstrate his unconcern. \"Well, tell Mr. Zulu to stand back from the cable panel and watch a datawarrior at work.\"\nMelissa signed this as a request. She and Chaka sat on the chairs. Chaka smiled at Melissa and signed as Mort opened the door-flaps to continue his illegal work.\n\"He wants to watch you, Mort. He says he'd like to be a datajack. I think he could be helpful to us, you know - with his photographic memory. He could store data for us in a secret way.\"\n\"Sure,\" replied Mort, as he replugged the handheld's tapcable into the diverter, then opened the handheld and set it on the table.\n\"And he could get us arrested, too. You know how MemorAD controls its people. They're looking for this Mem, now, I'm certain. I don't want us to be anywhere near him when they find him.\"\n\"That's not very charitable of you, Morty. The guy sounds desperate. You know the kind of slavery service in MemorAD is like. I think we should help him escape that, if we can.\"\n\"Yeah, sure, Babes. We'll take a rogue Mem under our wings and turn him into a top jack... Get real, will you?\"\nIgnoring Chaka, he and Melissa argued for awhile about their new friend, the homeless Mem. Disputing Melissa's advice was not always a good idea, since she tended to withold her \"services\" when she became too annoyed at her talented, but insufficiently-disciplined boyfriend... During the short argument, Mort's trusty handheld remained off. He was battery-conscious, to a fault.\nSeamus McLarge was having an attack of insomnia... He'd tossed and turned, and used his wakefulness to think about the problems of his office. But when he began fantasizing about strangling his snooty younger boss, he threw off the covers and went over to his desktop terminal.\n\"Judas Priest,\" he grumbled. He knew he'd be sleepy, tomorrow.\nMcLarge was only five-feet-four, but because of this - and his ironic surname - he was known to his fellow cybercops as \"Big Mac.\" Some who knew of his background also called him \"Father McLarge,\" too.\nInspector McLarge's traditional-Catholic family had eased him into a Jesuit seminary after he'd graduated from St. Aquin's Academy with a self-indulgent major in computer science. Initially, he was enthusiastic about becoming a Jesuit priest, but when he found himself under a military-style regime worse than anything he'd suffered under the stern Christian Brothers at the Academy, his ardor had dimmed. Besides, in the seminary, he'd missed working with computers more than he'd missed his family.\nWhen one of his teachers told him, \"Those machines spoiled you, son,\" Seamus found himself in agreement. He left the seminary for a starting position with a Web-authoring outfit.\nHe turned on his terminal. \"Now, where do I want to go, today?\"\nAfter the postnuclear Revolution, when the New Order closed the Web to all but a trusted, authorized elite, his employer went out of business. A friend of Seamus brought him into the Security Division of the new Cyberspace Regulation Administration. CRAD expanded as the Web contracted to fit the New Order's public-use specifications. Lots of cybercops were needed to deal with the angry groundswell of former-users who were now denied Web access by CRAD bureaucrats.\nSince those early days, things at Security had settled down to hunts for occasional, daring datajacks - like Mort Drago and Melissa Mawn. CRAD Security had developed some nasty software tools for detecting and thwarting jacks like Mort and Melissa. Some of these were known to the datajack community, but CRAD saved the nastiest of them for \"emergency use.\"\nInspector McLarge was about to have his own emergency.\n\"What the blue blazes is wrong with this box?\" (Big Mac never cursed, except euphemistically. His mother had cured him of that tendency even before the Jesuit fathers had their shot at him.)\nWhat was wrong was that Mort had diverted Big Mac's outgoing data stream to his handheld, but he hadn't turned the computer on, yet - creating a window of dead-service that was tragically short for Mort, but long enough for McLarge to check his cable and determine that it had been blocked, somewhere downline. This was sabotage!\n\"Bloody hell!\" (He didn't consider a reference to the Underworld a real curse, and \"bloody\" had long-ceased to mean \"By Our Lady.\")\nEver suspicious, McLarge immediately suspected foul play... He had taken this down-at-the-heels apartment in the Northeast Quadrant of Terminal City so he could relax at home, knowing that his vengeful enemies in the datajack community would be unlikely to find him there. His official address was the CRAD Batchelor Officers Quarters, downtown. While commuting, he disguised himself to foil any trackers who might be put on his tail. His disguise was a running joke within the CRAD security bureaucracy.\nUnfortunately for him, Mort Drago had discovered his hideaway from a source that would have infuriated Big Mac, had he know about her: a mole in CRAD. She was an old girlfriend of Mort's. She didn't work in the Inner Sanctum, but she did supply useful info.\nMcLarge donned his bathrobe, grabbed his cybercop ID and stunner, and headed for the basement.\nMort turned on his handheld. The CMOS processor leaped into RUN mode, without rebooting, and it immediately painted the flat-screen display with a notice: \"PILOT SIGNAL DETECTED.\"\nBig Mac had left his terminal on and probing the line for its downtown host machine in CRAD. That machine, OmniMAX, was a big, self-aware AI computer which was connected to the Web and just about every place else a cybercop needed to be connected to. Only right now, it wasn't connected to Big Mac's terminal. But the box had been persistently trying to make a connection with the AI.\nNow, with Mort's handheld turned on, the pilot signal passed through it and reached OmniMAX. The return signal requested an authenticator from McLarge's PermiPlug, then a password from him.\nBut the Inspector was in the elevator headed for the ground floor, and was muttering to himself. His plan was to switch to the basement stairway on the ground floor, and quietly catch the telcom vandals in the act of sabotaging his cable. This ground-floor switcheroo would slow him down, but he feared the elevator door opening in the basement would be heard by the saboteurs.\n\"Seamus's terminal has been turned on!\"\nMort often referred to Big Mac, derisively, by his forename. He felt he almost knew the cybercop, personally. He did know something about the Inspector, though. A few of his datajack friends had learned something of McLarge's modus operandi before he arrested them. And some of them had had the sense to log their pre-arrest experiences for the benefit of the cracker community.\nMelissa turned her attention to her wild talent. She could detect the descending, fuming Inspector. Everyone else upstairs was asleep.\n\"He's coming down in the elevator!\" Melissa's personal \"radar\" was better than the ultrasonar of a Class-1 guardbot.\nChaka was good at lip-reading, but he couldn't figure out why his new friends were becoming so agitated. Even before Melissa signed \"Follow me!\" to him, he stood and prepared for flight. When she ran for the basement corridor, he followed.\nMort jumped to the cable panel. He unplugged the handheld's tapcable from the diverter - leaving it in place - and followed Melissa and Chaka out of the cableroom.\n\"Damn! It'll take me a month to find another diverter!\" But he found it satisfying to know that its presence in the cabling would annoy the hell out of Seamus McLarge.\n\"Shhhh! He got off the elevator on the ground floor. He's coming down the center stairway.\" warned Melissa, as she and Chaka ran for an alarmed exit at the end of the corridor.\nMort followed, cursing under his breath at the sudden turn of events.\nThey turned a corner. Ahead was the exit door. Alarmed or not, it was their only hope. The goods-entrance they'd unlocked and slipped through was at the wrong end of the basement for them, now.\nThey reached the exit door's panic-bar just as a determined Inspector McLarge crept quietly from the stairway into the basement.\nBEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP... The exit alarm sounded in the quiet of the dingy basement, a quiet otherwise broken only by the labored breathing of the cybercop.\n\"Bloody hell!\" he repeated. \"He's getting away!\" McLarge had it fixed in his mind that his saboteur was a single daring datajack.\nFor a moment he stood rooted, frantically figuring what he should do. Of course, in his haste, he'd forgotten his cellphone. He couldn't call CRAD for outside backup. He scanned the corridor for a wallphone. There was none. He ran, puffing, in the direction of the beeping.\n\"You're out of shape, Seamus me boyo,\" he admitted to himself. As a long-time Inspector, he'd grown accustomed to relying on younger cybercops to chase any datajack who ran when discovered.\nHe passed the doorway to the cableroom, stopped, and gaped at the open cable panel. He could clearly see the diverter. He knew this was more than simple sabotage. He forgot about chasing the perp. He was wearing a bathrobe, and little else. He'd been so annoyed at the discovery of his hideaway apartment by a datajack, he hadn't even bothered to put on his slippers.\nHe entered the cableroom and inspected the wiretap. \"Nice work.\"\nThe tap bore the signature of an experienced datajack. His wirework was first-class. The guy had set up a table and chairs - two chairs. (\"Two datajacks, then.\") McLarge rubbed his chin stubble.\n\"They'll be back,\" he said, confidently. \"They haven't finished with me, yet... And when they return, I'll be waiting for 'em.\"\nHe made a mental note to get a tech down here, tomorrow. The two guys who'd tried to tap him had surely left fingerprints or other traces of their DNA somewhere in the cableroom, or elsewhere in the basement.\nSearching about, he discovered the previously-secret dwelling place of the unknown Chaka. Believing that a datajack was living in the basement of his building was profoundly disturbing to Big Mac.\n\"I'll get 'em. If it takes me a lifetime, I'll get the both of 'em.\" He wiped his brow with a handkerchief, and made a mental note to keep a cellphone in his bathrobe pocket.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

It began lean, efficient and laden with symbolism, but once he expanded it for dispatches such as \"God is immanent, transcendent, all-powerful and everlasting\" (M=LTYJ) the pastor saw his striving for simplicity and elegance would turn back upon him. He'd need a unique codemark or cryptolex for every divine attribute transmitted (l,800 in Cardiff's Creed). He soon agreed the Aquinas cipher (G=D, O=E, D=O) or even the Russell cipher (G=[x], O=[y], D=[x]) would better suit his mission.\nAbout that time his Board of Deacons, provoked by an errant scrutiny of key Gospel passages, voted to reduce the divine attributes by one. By lot, they picked All-merciful. Few had bothered to seriously weigh mercy's pros and cons; what really mattered was the Creed's attribute-total would no longer be a multiple of 18, the alpha-Judaic number par excellence.\nAncient desert folk used letters for numerals, and throughout the Old Testament 18 was written KhY (Kh=8, Y=10) which also spelled \"life.\" Which explains the abiding significance of the number and its multiples:\n\"How much for the honey cake?\"\n- \"One-eighty.\"\n\"How much for the woodcut, the old man with the book?\"\n- \"Three-sixty; for you, half off.\"\n\"How much for the sabbath candlesticks?\"\n- \"Eighteen-even.\"\n\"How much for the crucifix?\"\n- \"Seventeen-fifty.\"\nRhys clarified those Gospel passages for the Board, and tried to explain alpha-numerics were hardly religion-specific. Beyond alpha-Judaic, 18 was a noveno-Christian number, a twofold nine, nine being a trinity of trinities (3 x 3).\nA deacon rose: \"We ought then to revere our neglected 27, trinity cubed (3 x 3 x 3); or our long-shunned 81, trinity of trinities squared (9 x 9); or our cumbersome 729, trinity of trinities cubed (9 x 9 x 9).\"\n\"But that would waste our spirit,\" answered Rhys. \"For if the set of whole multiples of 3, as of 9, is infinite - if not, none but God knows the limits of the set - then naught but vanity would have us struggle to obtain a figure which God in His own good time will certainly reveal to us.\"\nAnother deacon rose: \"Is it not still true, to use the layman's expression, God helps those who help themselves? Are we to sit on our hands, our primeval digits, and let our pencils, calculators, slide rules and computers go to waste, to use our dear reverend's word, while the Earth and all who dwell therein go to hell in a handbasket? Ever since we were cast out of Eden our task has been to Do, to remake the world in our image, as He made us in His. Our active hands and minds have devised the abacus, the nomograph, the steam-, gasoline- and battery-powered calculators, the fruits of our creative genius. God has obliged us to hack our own path through the universe of number, to Find Him.\"\nRhys: \"Before He finds us. For He shall, and shall cherish us, He who loves the poor. And we'll indeed be poor. After we transfer into our Computer and Mathematics account every coin from our Missions account, our Food for the Homeless account, our Shelter for the Hungry account, our Emergency account, our Political Remonstrance account, our Staff and Officers' Salary, Expense and Retirement accounts - (my error; we can't touch those) - we'll indeed be well-shorn in His eyes, fulfilling neither His aims nor ours, His number still unknown.\"\nRhys sought to top off his theme (but ought to have left well enough alone) by demonstrating how 12345679 times 9 equals lll,lll,lll; how the same sequence times l8 comes to 222,222,222; how, times 27, it comes to 333,333,333; and so on, with like results each time the multiplier is built on 9.\n\"You left out 8,\" another deacon cut in. \"Why not 1234567-eight-9?\"\nSuspicious eyes glared at Rhys. He'd not expected this.\n\"It won't work with 8,\" he mumbled. \"Not always.\"\nHe sagged, for only a moment.\n\"Ah, but multiply the sequence by 72 (8 x 9, remember) and you get 888,888,888, more than enough to compensate. So you see, 8 walks among us, neither ostracized, anathematized nor excommunicated.\"\nMeant as a joke, for neither anathema nor excommunication lingered as options in his church; ostracism sufficed.\nBut for Rhys it was the beginning of the end.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

In the basement of Big Mac's apartment house, Mort installed a diverter on the cop's fiber-optic line. While the datajacks were distracted by the arrival of a new intruder, Big Mac discovered their tap and ran for the basement. Alerted, Mort and Melissa narrowly escaped - but after he saw their wirework, Big Mac vowed to capture the skilled, daring tappers.\nTerminal City was designed as a place where data began and ended.\nIt was the Terran planetary capital, but even before the advent of the New Order, it was planned as a place of residence only for those who worked for the government. Other workers had to live in the suburbs beyond the last of its circular streets. To accentuate this socio-separation, a Beltway was built in the park beyond Ring Z. It was an eight-lane, limited-access highway pierced with a limited number of tunnels and spanned by a limited number of bridges to conduct groundcar and transit traffic into and out of the capital city.\nBeyond the Beltway were the planned residential communities. And sprawling between those were the bidonvilles. These squatter-towns sprang up on undeveloped government land before the ponderous bureaucracy could stop them. Later, official policy was changed to allow them, since Terminal City and its \"official\" suburbs needed a lot of low-paid labor... The class-name of these towns derived from an ancient language, and originally meant shantytowns whose shacks were covered with discarded, hammered-flat gasoline cans.\nIt was in two of these unfashionable homes, that Mort and Melissa had been born. They met at their neighborhood's volunteer-school. They developed the same determination to rise above their station in life. And they both became apprentice datajacks by joining the same gang: the Legionnaires.\nAfter the Legion was broken-up by the arrest of most of its members, Mort and Melissa went into business, without incorporation, as Web datajacks and datapeddlers. They accessed the infobahn illegally and hazardously, and swiped data classified NOPUB (NO PUBlic Release, an umbrella classification used by the New Order for anything not considered TOP SECRET and given encrypted protection). They sold this government data, along with confidential commercial data, to parties willing to pay for it.\nIt was Mort's recurring daydream to discover a way to access the government's TOP SECRET data via the Web. With the big money he could make from selling T\/S data, he and Melissa could pay somebody to illegally house them inside the Beltway, where the opportunities for datajacking were better. Few residents of the bidonvilles had PermiPlugs for legal Web access. Those who did were expected to shamelessly snitch for the New Order government.\nThe PermiPlug... This desired device was a telcomm connector with a built-in data processor, ROMmed into which were a user's personal identification data. Each plug was pumped full of nitrogen and sealed. Opening one caused a vital component in the circuitry to catch fire and burn up in a flash. PermiPlugs could be counterfeited, but not very easily. A PermiPlug was required for legal Web access. Only the New Order elite possessed them.\nIt was to a sanctuary in the bidonville of Slaughtertown that Mort, Melissa, and Chaka - a homeless memory savant - fled after their unsuccessful attempt to wiretap CRAD Inspector, Seamus McLarge, in his hideaway apartment building.\nAs they hiked home from the Metro station, Chaka looked around him at the shacks of Slaughtertown, the dusty streets, and the shabbily- dressed residents shuffling by them with minimal animation. He smelled something malodorous in the hazy air, and signed to Melissa about it.\n\"He wants to know if the smell is from a slaughterhouse,\" she said to her boyfriend, smiling. \"He's a city-guy. He's never been outside the Beltway.\"\n\"Tell him the old slaughterhouse has been closed for years. That's the Dump he's smelling.\"\nMort made a note to investigate the background of the homeless Mem before the government's Special Memory Administration - MemorAD - could locate Chaka, and also grab Mort and Melissa for conspiracy to conceal a CC, a Controlled Citizen. That would bring them years in a Re-ed Camp, not to mention separation from each other.\nSlaughtertown was located on land formerly used for a sanitary landfill, and near Public Incinerator No. 3. The smoke from the latter's tall stacks was thin, but omnipresent. The changing wind carried it into every part of the town, denying nobody its acrid odor. The idealistic composting stations of the capital's early years had failed to keep up with its trash and garbage, and had been largely replaced by older, cheaper technologies.\nLiving atop the former landfill had its dangers, too. Methane gas from the covered, but decomposing, trash and garbage seeped upward into the shacks, awaiting only a flame or spark to set it off. It was now well-known in Slaughtertown that a mixture of 8% methane and 92% air turned any enclosed space into a big bomb.\n\"To Grandmother's house we go,\" Mort sang out cheerfully, even though he was still smarting from his failed datajack operation at Big Mac's apartment building, and the loss of his wiretap\/diverter in his haste to escape the wrathful cybercop. He knew he'd always be welcome and reasonably secure at Grandma Drago's - unless he went online from there. His fingerprints and DNA were not on record; few bidonvillers had been so recorded. But he knew that Seamus would be waiting for him to return to the apartment house on Ring T for another try at his datajack's revenge.\n\"Keep waiting, Seamus. I'll be back,\" he declared.\nInspector McLarge read his tech's report on his office terminal's screen. It was negative: no match for the fingerprints and DNA that were recovered from his apartment house's basement. He mumbled as he scanned the black-on-white words of government-standard display.\n\"Bidonvillers, I'll bet... And that's where they've gone to ground.\" \"But which one?\" There were 137 sizeable bidonvilles spread around the periphery of Terminal City.\nHe was frustrated by not having any data about the two perps. He continued reading the tech's report, but prepared himself for a disappointment... He didn't receive it.\n\"EXAMINATION OF THE ILLEGAL BASEMENT LIVING-AREA IN A STOREROOM, HOWEVER, HAS REVEALED THE IDENTITY OF ITS HOMELESS OCCUPANT.\" McLarge perked up. \"Now we're getting somewhere.\"\n\"MEMORAD RECORDS IDENTIFY...\" (\"A Mem!\") \"...DNA RECOVERED FROM THE LIVING-AREA AS BELONGING TO CONTROLLED CITIZEN CHAKA BOLTON: MALE, TWELVE YEARS OF AGE, DEAF\/MUTE, ORPHANED OF CIVIL-SERVANT PARENTS... [etc.] ESCAPED MEMORAD ACADEMY NO. 1 ON 4 JULY 34. WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN.\"\n\"No 1, eh?... He must be a first-class Mem. I wonder why MemorAD hasn't caught him, by now? Don't all Mems have implants?\" He made a mental note to do some research.\nNow he knew there were three fugitives from his basement. No datajack would dare live there. But a desperate, homeless Mem would.\nA hyperlink in the text took McLarge to an institutional portrait of Chaka Bolton. The cybercop copied the photo to slickpaper. As he was trimming it from the sheet with a pair of scissors to slide it into a plastisleeve of his wallet, he addressed it as if the Mem it depicted were here facing him.\n\"Son, you're going to lead me to those datajacks. I know you left with 'em, so I'm going to find you, first. That should be easy.\" All I have to do is post you onto the secret Web site for suburban snitches, and they'll deliver you to me tied with a red ribbon. Then, we'll see about finding your two datajack pals.\"\nHis desperate surmise about Chaka's accompaniment with Mort and Melissa in their sudden flight was a stab in the dark - but was, unfortunately for the datajacks, quite correct.\n\"Morton! Where've you been? I've been worried sick about you... Did you take Melissa into the city, again?... Who's this boy?\"\nMort, Mellisa, and Chaka were thus welcomed by Mort's grandmother to her Slaughtertown shack. Formerly the home of Mort's deceased parents, it was a roomy, unusually-well-built bungalow. On the outside, it looked as run-down as the others, but only because Mort's father, a master carpenter, had purposely designed it that way to discourage the local burglars. Inside, it was as clean and well-kept as any elite Ring-H Terminal City townhouse. It had electricity, telcom, and indoor plumbing ending in a septic tank.\nThe trio settled in, and Melissa began teaching Chaka the tricks of datajacking, using Mort's handheld - as well as she could without actually having Web access for demonstration... Mort soon began working on that access deficiency. His effort started with a coded knock on the front door, after supper.\n\"Hey! You made it back from Ringtown!\" Mort opened the door to find his fellow datajack, William \"Bad-Billy\" Saunders. The older jack was carrying a wrapped package, carefully, as if it contained something valuable - a rarity in Slaughtertown.\n\"We almost didn't make it back, man! It was wild! We almost zinged Big Mac - but I slipped, and he came after us. Almost got us, too.\" Mort was dying to relate the exciting tale to his friend. But, as usual, Billy's first priority was to show his friend something new he had obtained.\n\"Later, Morty... You gotta see this.\" Billy looked around at the other occupants of Grandma's. \"Where can we go? This is really hot stuff.\" Mort shrugged his shoulders at Melissa and took the visitor into a back room.\nBilly set the package on a nightstand and began unwrapping it. \"You're gonna love this, Morty-boy.\" With a flourish, he tore off the last wrapping.\n\"Oh, wow!\" exclaimed Mort.\n\"What'd I tell ya?\" grinned Billy. \"It's a real, working radiola.\"\nA RadioWeb device... Selected elitists of the New Order were issued portable computers with built-in radio transceivers. Each of these devices had a socket for its owner's PermiPlug. Anyone with a plugged RadioWeb box could access the Web from almost anywhere. Recv\/Xmit transceivers hung from streetlamp poles all around Terminal City, and were mounted on tall cellphone towers in the suburbs. Needless to say, it was highly dangerous to possess one of these \"radiolas,\" illegally.\n\"An R\/W box!\" Mort exulted, then he gained control of his enthusiasm and squinted suspiciously at Billy. \"Where did you get this?\"\n\"It's a long story,\" began Bad-Billy, boastfully. \"But it boils down to this: the VIP who owned it came out here from Ringtown to play with the girlies - you know, the young ones in Sadie's Place. And on the way back, he wrecked his groundcar. Some guys looted it, and set it on fire to cover the theft. The CRAP cops didn't come around looking for this radiola, so it found its way to me.\"\nMort was concerned about his friend's latest acquisition. Billy was the best datajack in Slaughtertown - maybe in any suburb. But with this stolen RadioWeb box, he was playing with fire.\n\"Come on, Billy... Do you know for sure this box doesn't have a transponder in it that squawks its ID in response to a radioprobe from OmniMAX?\"\nBilly defended his valuable possession. \"Naw. There's no 'sponder in this box. I jacked the specs from the manufacturer.\" He stroked the black box about the size of a laptop. Then, as if to minimize Mort's anxiety, he opened the unit and pulled up its small whip antenna.\n\"Don't turn that thing on here, man!\" shouted Mort. Billy smirked at Mort. \"Just showin' you the works, Morty. You aren't afraid of this here little beauty, are you?\"\n\"You're damned right I am,\" snapped the normally unshakable Mort. \"Even if doesn't have a 'sponder, its registration has probably been cancelled by OmniMAX. Transmit with it, and you pinpoint yourself for CRAD to come a-running.\"\n\"I know that. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.\" Billy frowned, then smiled, wickedly. \"But let's give it a try, and see.\" The R\/W was burning a hole in his self-control. He just had to try it out. He'd waited long enough to show it to Mort. Now he was going to use it, come what may.\nMort thought for a few seconds. He'd never seen a RadioWeb box in operation. \"Okay. But let's take it somewhere safer to try it out: the Dump.\"\n\"Yo!... She's charged-up and ready for action.\" Billy closed the box and rewrapped it. As they headed for the front door, Melissa stopped them.\n\"Where are you going with that device you're trying to hide, Billy?\" Her sixth sense told her that he'd had finally come into possession of the R\/W device he'd often talked about.\nMort spoke for his pal. \"Honey, we're going to the Dump to try it out. You can come if you want to,\" he said, hoping she would decline his invitation. This was dangerous business. Melissa was a good datajack, but sometimes she was too cautious for Mort's taste.\nMelissa ignored the invitation. \"Don't spend too much time on-air. OmniMAX may have that box's number on its Stolen List, and CRAD can find you pretty quick if it is. Radio stuff's not like wiretapping, you know. They can D\/F you in seconds.\"\n\"No way.\" asserted Billy. \"It's too early for listing this unit. Besides, I'm gonna change the registration to a legal account - as soon as I can find one.\"\n\"Oh, sure. You'll just open up its PermiPlug and change the ID data inside it,\" replied Melissa, sourly.\n\"I know somebody who can do that,\" boasted Billy. \"Don't fret, Babes.\" He turned to Mort. \"Time's awastin' Morty.\"\nThe two datajacks headed for the Dump with their new toy.\n\"You boys watch out. The Dump's a dangerous place,\" cautioned Grandma.\nTwilight had brought an end to operations at the active area of Sanitary Landfill No. 3, close-on to Slaughtertown. The last loads of trash and rotting garbage had been tipped from the truck ramps, and awaited organization by the forces of public sanitation.\n\"God, the smell. I'll never get used to it,\" declared Mort, wrinkling his nose.\nHe and his fellow datajack, Bad-Billy Saunders, stood at the edge of the current trench, on newly-covered refuse. They were not alone. Down in the trench, trash-pickers from Slaughtertown were sorting through the newly-tipped piles. The two datajacks were ignored by these desperate citizens. Billy spread an old blanket on the ground for them and his precious RadioWeb box.\n\"You spend too much time in Ringtown, Morty,\" he said.\n\"That's where the action is,\" replied Mort.\n\"Not this evening,\" said Billy, with finality.\nHe opened his black box, raised its antenna, and prepared to turn the unit on.\n\"I wish we could do this from down in the trench. I feel too exposed, up here,\" said Mort. In the distance, he could clearly see the night lights of Terminal City - \"Ringtown\" to his irreverent friend.\n\"We couldn't acquire a transceiver station from down there,\" Billy asserted. \"Okay, are you ready for some big Web access?\"\n\"Fire it up, Billy-boy.\"\nBilly pushed the R\/W's power switch. The box booted-up and logged onto the Web, without further intervention. The wreck victim's start page appeared on the screen.\n\"Jeez - it's CRAP City! Who was that guy?\" he pondered, referring to the former owner of the black box.\nThe colorful CRAD homepage greeted them. \"WELCOME TO C-R-A-D. HOW MAY WE ASSIST YOU, SIR?\" inquired the site's vox. Mort grabbed Billy's shoulder to warn him against replying, flippantly. But Billy disabled the unit's voice-input. The R\/W switched to keyboard-input mode.\nBilly's customary smirk was gone. \"The guy who owned this must have been a big time CRAP artist,\" he joked. \"But who cares? This is an invitation to explore CRAP's homesite. I accept. I think I'll send some provocative email, then slap a colorful F\/U banner across the intro page.\"\n\"Come on, man! Don't do anything stupid. Just surf and leave. CRAD's site is probably loaded with cracker detectors and other bad stuff.\"\n\"Chicken,\" snorted Billy.\nMort waved his arms and clucked, and they both had a loud - but nervous - laugh.\nSeamus McLarge's terminal beeped while he was watching an old crime televideo in his pajamas. He lazily switched the terminal's display to his TV screen. It displayed, in big shadowed letters,\nEMERGENCY CALL FROM OMNIMAX.\nThe cybercop said, \"Terminal: voice mode... Whatcha got, MAX?\"\nA stylized representation of OmniMAX appeared. The terminal's vox sounded the big computer's words as its display echoed them on the TV screen.\n\"ILLEGAL USE OF A RADIOWEB UNIT DETECTED. UNIT REPORTED LOST AFTER GROUNDCAR ACCIDENT OF CRAD OFFICIAL.\"\n\"Display location map.\"\nOmniMAX sent a small-scale map of the city and its surrounding suburbs. A red dot flashed outside the Beltway.\n\"Zoom in... Zoom... Zoom... Stop.\" He stared at the brown landmark streets, overlayed by the green radiotriangulation bearing-lines. As did the ancient Inspector Javert, Big Mac cried out in triumph.\n\"I knew it!\" He added, \"It's Slaughtertown - datajack territory.\"\nHis intense urge to collar his would-be tormentors led him to make a risky, but correct, assumption.\n\"It's the basement gang, alright. Only someone who'd tap my telcom cable would use a stolen RadioWeb box - and so soon afterward, too. Max: dispatch a radiopatrol aircar from CRAD, and have them stop at my apartment building.\" The computer replied, \"COMPLYING.\"\nMcLarge ran for his bedroom, shedding his pajamas as he went.\n\"Billy, don't.\" warned Mort. His talented but reckless friend was composing a flaming email to be left in Big Mac's mailbox.\n\"Sorry, Mort. You failed to zing him. It's my turn, now.\"\nMort looked around, anxiously, as if he expected CRAD cops might be falling silently from the sky in parachutes. He scanned the horizon in the direction of Terminal City. He listened for aircar sounds, but he heard only the clink of trash being sorted in the trench by the pickers.\n\"You've probably already set off several alarms, Billy. Pull out now, before they triangulate your precious box... What are you writing?\"\n\"I'm sending Big Mac an anonymous warning about his telcom cables.\" He chuckled at his own daring, but Mort failed to see the humor.\n\"Please don't. Seamus may have put some of your probable words on OmniMAX's Watchlist. Even if nothing else does, that'll set off an alarm.\" He took another look around him.\n\"Okay, Morty-boy. I'll use run-of-the-mill vulgarity.\"\n\"Hurry up. You've been online with that box too long, already.\"\nIn the patrol aircar, Inspector McLarge looked at the console map and decided they were close enough to the Slaughtertown landfill to unleash his secret weapon. He sought to arrive at the triangulation point just about the time his spider was doing its damage. He keyed his mike.\n\"Max: activate Black Widow. Repeat, activate Black Widow.\"\nThere was no need for a repeat, however. The computer ran a special security program, inputing the coordinates of the illegal R\/W unit. The supervenomous cyberspider was routed to CRAD's radio-access facility and promptly transmitted as a short program datastream to Bad-Billy's new box - piggybacked secretly onto the CRAD homesite's data-transmission carrier wave.\n\"This'll fix 'em, good,\" declared McLarge to the other cybercops. \"They won't be using that damn radiola again.\" The others smiled. They'd never heard of Black Widow, but they knew about security spiders, and they guessed this one was pure poison for their quarry.\nBilly was so absorbed in his work at the smelly Dump, he failed to notice the new odor of burning electronics... But Mort did.\n\"The box! It's smoking!\"\n\"What the hell!\" Billy belatedly realized he was in trouble.\nMort quickly scanned the sky. Now, he saw the aircar marker lamps almost lost in the brighter lights of Terminal City. The craft was coming toward them nap-of-the-earth, at top speed.\n\"CRAD cops!\" he yelled.\nBilly mistakenly glanced around for approaching vehicles. There were none. He returned his attention to the keyboard, determined to save his precious RadioWeb unit by shutting it down.\n\"I can't turn it off,\" he discovered, to his surprise.\n\"Leave it! They've spidered us!\" Mort took another look at the approaching aircar lights, and screamed, \"Aircar! Run!\" as he leaped into the landfill's new trench... That hurt.\nHe picked himself up and frantically sought a place to hide. With luck, the aircar cops might not have spotted him, yet. He looked for Billy, but his fellow datajack was still up on the plateau.\nThe trashpickers in the wide trench noticed him, though. They had stopped sorting and were poised for flight. What they were doing wasn't illegal - but when cops showed up, they ran.\n\"Cops!\" Mort yelled. They scattered like trash rats at a gunshot.\nHe found an overhang of newly-tipped refuse, ducked under it, and wormed himself into the smelly stuff beneath it, leaving only a hole for air. The odor was gagging, but he managed to keep his supper down while he listened for further developments.\nHe heard the loud sounds of an aircar landing. Masked by the noise of the whirling rotor, Billy's voice could be heard yelling abuse at the cops. Then, the aircar took off and circled over the area. Below it were a multitude of additional suspects, running hither and yon.\nAfter circling, Inspector McLarge gave up trying to figure out which one of them might have made the other footprints at the scene of the crime. The patrol unit flew off to the downtown CRAD complex.\n\"I'll get him, later.\" He smiled and looked at Bad-Billy Saunders, who was bound and gagged. \"You'll tell me - won't you, boyo.\"\nMort waited for almost an hour, in case the patrol had left a couple of cybercops to quietly search for a hider like him. When he emerged from his hole, he found himself all alone in the landfill trench. He gazed up at the starry night sky and clasped his hands.\n\"Thank you, Lord.\" He wasn't very religious, but this was a kind of battlefield situation. He recalled an old quotation: \"There are no atheists in the tranches.\" This recollection made him laugh aloud, until caution got the better of him. \"Escaping CRAD twice in one week... Not bad,\" he whispered to himself.\nAs he walked out of the soggy morass, he spooked the real trash rats that had emerged their holes after the ruckus, and they scampered away from his carefree footfalls.\nWhen Mort reached Grandma's house, he found only a pile of splintered wood, surrounded on all sides by the badly-damaged shacks of her neighbors.\nHe stood in shock for awhile, then approached one of those picking through the ruins.\n\"What the hell happened?!\" He knew the answer.\nThe man pointed to what was left of Mort's only home in Slaughtertown.\n\"Gas explosion,\" he said. \"Got some of my place, too.\"\nHis face a mask of anguish, Mort inquired about the former residents of the house his father had built so soundly, the one that was now only scrap lumber and kindling.\n\"That was your place, wasn't it?\" replied the neighbor, gravely. He added, \"There wasn't anybody there when it went. I don't know where they were, but they sure were lucky to be away when the place blew up.\"\n\"Yeah...\" Mort was in a daze. After a few hours in safe suburbia, his friend had been arrested, he had been soaked with garbage - and he, his girlfriend, his grandmother, and Chaka Bolton, had all been made homeless.\nThe neighbor sniffed, and asked, tactlessly, \"What happened to you? Smells like you fell off a collection wagon.\"\nIn Slaughtertown, refuse was collected by a horse-drawn wagon driven by community volunteers. Backward as that seemed to newcomers, it was considered \"appropriate technology\" by town residents. Collection trucks were for the \"official\" suburbs. The only reason the town had volunteers for this distasteful work was that it allowed those doing it first-crack at the refuse. Some of them almost got rich collecting trash. Rich by bidonville standards, that is.\nMort's thoughts were of Melissa, Grandma, and Chaka - in that order. Where had they gone to, before the explosion?... Where could he go, now... (\"Melissa's parents' place. They have to be there.\")\nDirty, smelly, weary, he set off for the Mawn place.\nMort was correct about the temporary abode of his \"family.\" They were crowded into the Mawn household. Grandma wept to see her grandson.\n\"What happened? Where did you go before the bang?\" he asked Melissa.\n\"Grandma took us to church. Chaka wanted to go; he's never been to one of those places, before. MemorAD doesn't allow its charges any religious influences... I guess we were sent there by divine intervention,\" she grinned. \"Or something.\"\n\"We'll need some more of it, then. CRAD arrested Billy. I got away - I think.\"\nShe sniffed him. \"What did you jump into?\"\n\"My future,\" he replied, gloomily. She understood. \"And Billy...?\"\n\"He'll talk. He knows about our operation in Seamus's basement. He'll use that knowlege to make things easier for himself.\" Mort looked chastened, and sought advice from his savvy girlfriend. \"What do we do now, Babes?\"\n\"You take a bath. Then, we'll talk about it.\"\n\"I'm gonna to get Seamus for this,\" he declared, grimly.\n\"No, Mort,\" replied Melissa as she pulled him past the wrinkled noses of the enlarged Mawn household, toward the bathroom.\n\"He's going to get you - sooner or later.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I know you wanted to get home before the hardware store closed. My last meeting of the day ran an hour late.\"\nAs the car door slid shut, the car started slowly forward, weaving delicately into traffic. The low whirr of the engine was barely audible behind the beginning babble of the local news broadcast. The car picked up speed.\n\"That's OK, Dan, I told Marisa that it was an 82% chance that you'd have a late day today, so I think she picked up those pieces I need this afternoon.\"\n\"Good thinking! 82%? That's funny, I had calculated 67% myself, but only when I factored in the timing of my boss' flight from Hallah Valley.\"\n\"Ha! I tell ya, the 16 degree-of-freedom approach has a lot more accurate predictions. I had a 77% on Frederic being a boy last year, remember? What was it that you had, Dan?\"\n\"54%.\"\n\"I should be working on stock predictions instead of doing these data implants. I keep telling them that it's not how much data you have, it's all about using the right data and the right method.\"\n\"We've had this discussion a hundred times, Chris! The Richler-Ziemann model is what we use at work and that's widely believed to be the most accurate method ever! How can you honestly dispute the 99.4% prediction of the acceptance of the Kepler model of the solar system? Or the 98.2% prediction of the popularity of The Beatles? And don't forget about Pamela Anderson's third breast enlargements. All it needed was the computing power and the complete data sets - of which we're getting so close to, Chris! So close!\" He emphasized his point by striking the dashboard with a closed fist, producing a low thud.\n\"Okay, okay... I know what your reasons are... regular folks like us still don't have that kind of juice to do it, that's all.\" He paused for a moment to consider something. \"How's it going, by the way? Last time we talked about this, you were talking about a Bible run?\"\n\"We're not that far yet, but the data is looking good. I don't want to get too excited about it though.\"\n\"How can you not get excited about discovering the secret of the Bible! The oldest full manuscript that we'll have ever used! Nobody has ever achieved a higher prediction factor of 35.3% on it! Come on, Dan, tell me how far you guys have gotten!!!\"\nDan shifted slightly and gripped the console interface tightly, showing the whites of his knuckles. \"I don't want to get excited.\"\n\"Shit! Dan... Daniel. We've been friends since our first characteristics testing at age four. Our characteristics say we'll be friends until we die! We've gone through our schooling together, our initiations, our marriages, our kids, our jobs, our whole lives! Come on, tell me! Tell me! Is it better than 30%?\"\nNo answer. The radio bubbles a traffic prediction. The car veers left onto a side road.\n\"Better than 40%?!\"\n\"Maybe.\"\n\"Better than 40! Oh, shit! 50%, Dan?\"\nA smile. The car speeds up. \"Keep going.\"\n\"60%? You've come 60% to understanding the underlying nature of the Bible, the word of God, of humanity....\"\n\"Better.\"\n\"70%?\"\n....\n\"80%?\"\n.....\nDan, Chris and the car stop immediately, without notice, nor a deceleration, from 135 km\/hr to 0km\/hr, directly in front of a dazzling display of a spectrum of energies, felt as changing colours, disruptions of gravity, pinpricks of pressure all over their bodies, waves of deja vu and an overwhelming sense of insecurity. A bolt of white-hot lightning strikes the hood, showering sparks and jolting long-forgotten memories. White, coherent light beams down onto the car, crystallizing the plastic and metal into a translucent, gel-like matter. The sound of Chris' primal yell distorts into an earth-like murmur and whistle. They are lifted from the weight of gravity and pressure from the thousands of meters of air above them and float gently a few centimeters above their seats.\nFor a moment, they believe they are dead, while their senses are astounded, but it passes and soon their minds are clear and open to a genius of life that has eluded their livelihoods. They begin to understand the intricate past paths they have studied, and the absolutely beautiful sense that there is more.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Chairman Katerin pounded on the gavel, but his daughter Clare turned up the volume of her mike. The members booed her. She continued.\n\"Two teenagers entered a restricted military site rumored to store nuclear weapons. They fell from the roof of the control tower, to their deaths. Clan McDonald members claim the police did not fully investigate the alleged accidents. I don't want to live in a society where such concerns are ignored. Approve their access to a legal suit.\"\nYou may get your wish. Brave or stupid... don't understand the situation? You could become a candidate for hypnotic counselling, if you try to limit the Council's access to high tech weapons. I'd better go down to the meeting room.\nAll talking ceased. The committee waited. \"Of course they may seek legal redress, after the election. But now we are running on an antiterrorism platform, against Ian McDonald and his gang. To stop the violence is our major priority. We shall examine this referral later. My daughter Clare was renominated for the Council. However I am assigning her to an LOA on Earth. She will remain there for a two year period, starting now.\" The Chair said with the calm affect of a judge.\n\"My vote to open a formal investigation still stands. Lax security at the weapons site endangers us all.\" Clare distributed handouts and articles pertinent to security issues. Guards took her to the nearest hypnotist counsellor.\nVince followed them and whispered to Clare, \"You're causing trouble for your father.\" He turned to the counsellor and showed his authorization. \"Clare is on a mission for the Chairman. She has no time for a psychological assessment, before boarding the Earth shuttle.\"\n\"Mini assessment ordered. First: a 100 question test.\" That took 5 minutes to administer and machine analyze. \"Since I found no evidence of disloyalty there is no reason for detention. Your brain scan and blood test show interesting evidence of brain enhancement through adrenal gland implants.\" Clare wrote down a reference for him, detailing research findings. The hypnotist signed her departure permission.\n\"You did a dangerous thing, speaking out,\" Vince said. \"Don't return home. We'll go straight to Spaceport.\"\n\"I have no clothes or credits with me.\" Vince Amati may look like a pro wrestler, but he is an intelligence op. His accent and rhythm in speaking are wrong for his phony immigrant cover story. \"Did my Dad send you?\"\n\"No. You've said enough. I'll bill you later. To vote your conscience and harm your career isn't an easy choice. The fights in your family may have less to do with principle than inheritance. Have the courage to face reality. Sometime in the future, you will have a family feud over inheritance.\"\n\"I was adopted, from Clan McDonald parents, so I could have a better life. Didn't know citizens faced the hypnotists' increasing power here.\" She e-mailed the Chair. \"This letter gives up any financial claim on your estate as my punishment. The Luna struggle where I could make a difference is important to me. Let me stay.\"\nShe got e-mail. \"No. You will adapt to Scotland. Sometimes you don't recognize the gate to opportunity.\"\nA month later, Clare returned to her new apartment in Glasgow. The building housed other colonists, making a new life away from the low wages and terrorist activity of the Luna Federation. The tall brunette found work as a model and accessories buyer while attending the Atheneum Art Institute. First bed for a nap, then back to work on her student presentation.\nSomething was wrong with the building. Graffiti? No trace now of where a vandal spray painted the building, \"GO BACK HOME.\" Vince informed a local Highlanders group, who helped the residents remove the graffiti.\nPosters? They advertised the Glasgow visit of the Luna Ambassador. Concerned about the \"Brain drain,\" he hoped to persuade colonists to return home. Today the terrorists threatened to expand their attacks from Luna to target colonists relocating to Earth.\nCurtains! The curtains in Vince's corner apartment remained closed at... math time: her watch was still set for Paris... 9:00 a.m. Holiday? Illness?\nA delivery man pounded on her door. \"Your neighbor's out. Will you take in the fruit basket?\"\n\"No.\" The basket could be a trick, or lethal, or a request for help from someone who wished to remain anonymous. I feel scunnered with myself. Funny how the dialect comes back.\nThe new residents noticed the curtains, and turned for leadership to the nearest politically connected Katerin - a long-term habit. \"Clare will find out the problem.\" She could afford to move out to interact more with the diverse group of Glaswegians, but usually, she enjoyed helping the new arrivals. She referred them to the honest people with clout in the government and in business. Today Clare advised, \"Don't get involved with a Council op. in a potentially dangerous situation.\"\nThis afternoon she needed to present her project. The Atheneum selected her for their annual Student Awards Day. Can't concentrate on preparing till I check on Vince. She walked past the waiting residents, who smiled and nodded.\n\"Need help Vince?\" Clare picked the lock, then called out as she entered the apartment. \"Just jet lagged from Paris, merci beaucoup.\" Vince lay unconscious, face down on the floor. All colonists are sleep taught civil defense procedures as children. She ran forward to cut out a tissue disk from the back of his neck - the kind used by a marksman or illegal safari hunter to tag and locate the target with a sensorscope. Then examined the disk more closely. Should have been deeply inserted into his scalp due to the force of the shot. Instead it was hand placed into his brown hair.\nShe sat down, shaking with rage. \"How could you and the Council do this? Fake a real life episode that so many of us have experienced. If you publish this staged incident as an example of anti-Earth violence, I shall go to the Council and accuse you of lying and propaganda.\"\nVince sat up. \"The Ambassador never expected you, his spoiled rich cousin, to turn hero. Now the Council is collaborating with him to catch a terrorist. The custodian will find me in five minutes and report the incident to the police. Go home.\"\n\"FYI, be more selective with your assistants.\" The sadness on her face silenced him. \"I belong to a Target family, so we're informed about safety checks. She showed him with mirrors that under his jacket collar someone hid a second active tissue disc. The paralyzing poison was eating its way through the collar towards his neck.\nVince jumped up off the floor, divested himself of the hidden tissue disc and other equipment and vaporized them. \"The custodian turned you in as a terrorist leader for the reward. We were just checking to see if you would search the apartment or act suspicious. Deliver the package to the picnic. Do that much to help.\"\nShe opened the curtains and left amid congratulations for saving Vince's life. She explained it was an exercise against terrorism. Invitations to the community picnic were accompanied by a wink. \"We know, who's going to hear the Ambassador speak.\" She was educated to marry the Ambassador and help him become viceroy of Luna. Fortunately he didn't deviate from the family plan, and was promoted. She refused to keep secret from him that her birth parents were executed for treason and was disqualified as too controversial.\nFirst brunch, then polish the project. The Institute adviser said yesterday,\"You lack one exciting detail to make your accessory presentation a hot selling idea.\" Come up with that. No fresh ideas. Maybe the music and dancing later will inspire me. Perhaps radicals intend to demonstrate against Luna. A university campus offers open debates, and diverse participants. She put on her pink turban and placed the fruit basket with the other prizes. She waited for trouble.\nEveryone seems to be enjoying the outdoor meeting in Kelvingrove Park. Kelvin believed that what you can't measure and number isn't knowledge, as science is knowledge. You can count that on stage are 20 women dancers wearing the traditional black cotton pants and tunic, with a pink turban pulled over sun streaked hair. Message sent, \"I'm a colonist.\" Message received, different for each audience member. How to influence the Council members?\nA burly Realtor in a loud aloha shirt appeared. \"You live in Maryhill or Milngavie? I'm in real estate. First rule is location, then price. My card.\" Didn't say how much Vince charged in fees, when undercover as a Realtor.\nA cop drove his car over the grass to the Ambassador's table. Clare moved closer. People tensed for trouble. Then the Ambassador stepped out of the car wearing the green cap and arm band of a male colonist. His aide in the McDonald yellow and black tartan played the bagpipes, as he crossed the grass with kilted dancers from the second group of entertainers.\n\"Too bad you don't have his political skills. My card,\" Vince repeated as they joined in singing both National Anthems. \"I didn't say thanks properly. I'm focused on the assignment.\"\n\"I admire the Luna Council agents for breaking up that terrorist group who tried to recruit the Scottish clans last year. Our fighting on Luna started off as a justified protest against Earth's rule. Now we're killing our brothers and sisters in a civil war.\"\nThe Ambassador hovered near the podium. Needed to lower it for him. He had a boyish face, short military haircut and beautiful smile. The Ambassador introduced himself as Mickey in English and dialect. \"A woman from Luna isn't eating because a friend from Earth brought a tray of unfamiliar food to her. Stand in the buffet line and choose for yourself what to eat.\"\nCultural choice or they're scared of deliberate contamination by terrorists. Clare said, \"I heard that a volunteer had the flu, so I'm sterilizing the food on my tray. Also I'm allergic, so I want a chemical analysis.\" The organizers insisted on having these machines on site to avoid problems.\nThey waved her to come into the kitchen. The cautious participants followed to check for infection, or poison in the meal. None found. Everybody relaxed and ate. The fruit basket contained a tape recorder that Vince confiscated. The rest of the prizes were found to be OK.\n\"We want you to return and take up your family and business responsibilities instead of calling yourself an artist,\" the Ambassador said. \"Your father refuses to make concessions for peace. You have a vote on the Luna Council. People are dying, and you're here with your greedy friends and their stupid projects. I shall be forced to extradite you.\" He returned to the podium.\n\"People die all the time throughout the galaxy. I don't flatter myself that I can compete with all the wealthy important women, who want to rule Luna with you. I have a different mission, to use my talent in art.\"\n\"I'm returning to Luna,\" Vince said. \"You should go back and vote.\"\n\"And get killed. I'm not a hero.\" Clare hid in the portable toilet unit to avoid an extradition order. When the speech started, she drove home. Must leave for the project demo, with something new. Clare sat on the sofa. She was roused from a nap by a woman's scream, a man's deep voice and the crash of falling furniture. The dog barked. Forgetting the emergency number, 911, Clare ran over and pounded on the door.\n\"We woke you up with that noise, after you were so kind when I had surgery.\" May turned off the soap opera and scolded a tiny poodle. Both had a lot of fair hair, and color coordinated outfits.\n\"I had no idea that Susie had such great outfits. Won't she make a mess on your clothes?\"\n\"Baby pool pants prevent leakage.\"\n\"Please lend me your dog and her pool pants wardrobe for a presentation.\" Vince's car approached the parking lot.\n\"I'll come with you both. Told the family you would see Susie's potential.\" May drove and Clare sat on the floor, to avoid Vincent.\nOn the car radio, Headline News announced the Luna election race for Prime Minister was tight. Vince switched it off to confirm that it was necessary to deliver Clare to the Luna Council. The vote was too close to call.\nAt the Atheneum, Clare was surprised to see how many successful alumni showed up to encourage and offer work to current students. Standards were higher than she anticipated. Clare felt superior to the money loving Earth residents, but now she looked at their radiant faces and changed her mind.\n\"Now improvise a photo presentation.\"\nClare positioned a seated model as Venus, with a mound of accessories in front of her. The cute poodle licked her face. \"Title... Fit for a goddess.\" Okay. But not as original as other presenters. They sang, danced, painted and read poetry, while Clare expected to succeed on May and Susie's talents. The gate made for Clare was closing, like Kafka wrote. She had no big finish and didn't like to lose.\nMickey and bodyguards showed up, and demanded that Clare either return to Luna to vote for the concessions, or face civil disobedience charges\n\"Forget the stale fashion model approach. Videotape an average looking woman, me and Susie, I brought our ten matching outfits,\" May hissed. Her eyes shone with love as she stepped behind a screen to change, then presented different outfits to Susie for approval. Clare nodded to a fiddle playing presenter, who wanted a piece of the action. Susie did a two hind legs dance as her big finish. The execs stood up and high fived.\n\"We want you and Susie for a series of commercials, May.\"\n\"We're artists. Clare's our agent, provided she has an acceptable percentage and a role in the production.\" They met with the marketing people and signed the contracts. Smiling Mickey and Vince shook Susie's paw for photo op, then responded to the pager.\nClare passed Vince a towel for the sweat pouring down his face. He looked as if it were blood oozing from his pores. He said, \"Your Dad won the primary election, then was killed by a car bomb. Suppose you and the Ambassador will be returning home.\"\n\"I must find another voter, the Scottish Judge ruled,\" the Ambassador said. \"I'll appoint you Vince, Clare can stay in Glasgow, where she's happy.\" He went to Spaceport.\n\"I thought you and I might become friends, Vince. What about limiting undercover assignments, so I won't worry?\" Clare said.\n\"Some things you don't know. I'm really Ian McDonald's brother.\"\nClare hit the police emergency button. Bitter disappointment, Vince a member of the fanatic terrorists. She raised her hands to release the poisoned darts, then lowered them. \"I need help, I don't want to kill anyone.\"\nVince vaporized the weapons and took Clare to a deprogramming military clinic. The hypnotist said, \"She's OK. We make a hypnotic suggestion that aborts the program for assassination.\"\n\"Please drive me to Spaceport. I have to show up at the Luna Council and confront you and Ian McDonald to explain your actions.\"\nAt the Luna Council meeting the Ambassador said, \"Ian McDonald is dead and his gang dispersed after the Chair's murder. We should table the agenda including Clare's LOA assignment until after the new Council is seated. Why didn't you tell Clare about Ian and the potential changes we plan to institute?\"\n\"I was desperate enough to consider kidnapping her if necessary,\" Vince said, his face flushing. \"She wouldn't come for the peace agreement, she came for vengeance. OK you'll obtain justice in court. You're changing Clare, and it's not an improvement.\"\n\"I want us to move on and see the final report on the teenagers and what is on site that's dangerous to the Clan McDonald community. Next we'll debate on the vote for peace. Then I can walk through my gate to my new life.\" The table motion won.\nBoth Vince Amati McDonald and Clare Katerin were nominated for Council members, but they lacked the money to campaign. \"Your wee cousin will help herself and you.\" Clare contacted May and the ad agency about her proposal for a Susie commercial. Only after child actor and lost Susie share a box of Cereal Plus do they find the way home.\nThe Council selected Vince as Chair. Merited and a sign to the Clan of changing times. Clare felt the weight of the documents the committee was to read and comment on. This is your life, live it.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Earth became an adopted home for the aliens. For hundreds of years the two races of beings grew in harmony and the planet became known as a haven of peace.\nEarth began to attract other beings from the galaxy. The Ramsies, a race from further out than the Dalphites, arrived on Earth and began to teach the Earthlings as well. From the beginning, the Dalphites did not trust the Ramsies and secretly resented them. Yet, the Earthlings benefited from the two alien races; great deeds and inventions began to occur all over the planet.\nThen, as was prophesied, Michael, a powerful Dalphite leader, arrived to make his home on Earth. He offered his spiritual and philosophical beliefs to his beloved Earth people. He was only able to remain a short while, but many Earthlings grew to love him and believe as he did.\nThe Ramsies, in turn, began to fear Michael's influence and began to challenge his teachings vehemently. A great battle of words and accusations arose between the two races. Suddenly, without any advance warning, the Dalphi leaders ordered Michael to leave Earth. Confused but obedient, Michael left the debate unsettled. He did promise, though, as he prepared to leave, that he would return and that his ever watchful eye would never leave his favored world. He would return someday, he said, and finish what he had begun.\nTwo millennia later, a Dalphite craft hovered just outside of Earth's detection systems. The long, white corridors of the Dalphite craft were busy as usual with the crew members making their way to their assigned stations. Traclin, a tall, slender Dalphite, who had been a close attendant of Michael's on Dalphi, moved within the hurried flow of fellow Earth-watchers. His troubled mind raced with the planet's proposed fate.\nAs he turned a corner to enter the command center, his heart sickened with the reminder of Michael's vow to never alter the Earth beyond the universe's own spiritual and kinetic designs. Perhaps this time Michael would see the need to move beyond those parameters of conduct. Perhaps soon the Dalphites could openly return to Earth and once again reside with their chosen people.\nTraclin anxiously entered the code to gain entrance into the Center. He smiled bitterly as he entered the word, \"ALLIANCE\", and then shook his head at the cold irony of the word. If the Ramsies, also asked to leave by the Prime Council one millennia ago, kept gaining power on the planet below, then the Dalphites and the Prime Council could kiss the planet's future good-bye: The Ramsies had proven to be too power hungry for everyone's tastes; except the tastes of the Earthlings. They, too, sadly enough, had found a lust for power. Despite the early history of the Dalphites and the Earthlings, the Ramsies were now the dominant influence on the blue and white planet.\nThe doors opened then with a smart click that resounded in Traclin's ears. He shook himself out of his world of thoughts and quickly entered. As his eyes raised to survey the room, he stopped himself short and gasped silently at what lay before him. He was met by the glorious sight of the Earth world brilliantly revealed throughout the huge observation window in the Command Center. He stood transfixed. His mind began to relax as he remembered the very first time that he had seen Earth. It never failed to amaze him how deeply blue were the waters and how white and peaceful were the clouds. The planet was so graceful as it hung against the backdrop of twinkling stars and nebula. There were so few planets, thought Traclin, in the galaxy that had such peaceful and pleasant colors. A warm feeling seeped into his soul and the desire to see the Earthlings live once again in peace overtook him.\nA sudden sense of urgency struck him cold as he tore his gaze from the world outside of the window. An attendant approached him, slightly bowed, and waited to be acknowledged.\n\"Salam Ishi, Traclin,\" the attendant whispered.\n\"Ishi Salam. Is he here?\" Traclin snapped back.\nThe attendant nodded and pointed towards Traclin's Captain's Room. \"In there.\"\nTraclin barely nodded in return before he turned on his heels and hurried into the meeting. He did not hear the \"Salam Amar\" that followed him across the room from his crew; the long conference with Michael just hours before was too heavy on his mind. Traclin was already exhausted, and there was still much to do.\nAs Traclin rushed into his Room, he wondered how the Earthbounder would feel about the present situation down on Earth. Traclin never knew how the 'Bounders would react anymore. Some remained loyal to Michael and his teachings, while others were influenced by Earth's traditions and sometimes found in difficult to find the meeting ground between the two. In fact, there was still a heated debate going on in the Prime Council over whether there was a \"meeting ground\" for any teachings or alterations that would coincide within the balance of the galaxy. Nevertheless, the Prime Council and the 'Bounders did recognize that there was a need for Dalphite aid despite the repeated protests of the Ramsies. Furthermore, there were still many who followed Michael - even those who held seats on the Prime Council. For that, Traclin was relieved and grateful to the Spirits of the Cosmos.\nThe Earthbounder sat in a chair near Traclin's own private observation window. The 'Bounder failed to stir when Traclin took the seat opposite him. The two Dalphites watched the Earth for a few quiet moments, and then the 'Bounder spoke.\n\"Salam Ishi,\" he greeted as Traclin mumbled the correct reply as he drummed his fingertips on the desktop, \"I'm glad that you came so soon, Captain. We feared that Michael would delay too long.\"\nTraclin searched the 'Bounders face for the Truth but was only met with the tired expression of a worried man. The 'Bounder was apparently stationed in the western part of the world. His clothing consisted of loose-fitting, thick cloth of one solid color with a hood on the pullover jacket. Traclin searched his mind for the correct English word for the attire but could only come up with something akin to \"moisture.\" He frowned as his mind continued to wander.\n\"We have a situation where several small Middle Eastern countries have united into a coalition of sorts,\" the 'Bounder paused as he turned his gaze back towards the Earth. \"They are declaring themselves as one nation to the rest of the world and threatening to fight anyone who dares oppose their alliance.\" Traclin nodded vaguely as he continued to stare at the clothes of the man. \"The situation is extremely volatile. The West, namely America, does not want this coalition to be accepted by the United Nations, but there's not much that they alone can do about it. The newly united Arab nations are calling themselves a Brotherhood of Islam, and they have released a list of their goals and objectives to the U.N. They wish to spread their beliefs to the rest of the world. They say that Allah commands it. Even at the risk of a war. A Holy war. Hostility is almost in the air that we're breathing down there. The Ramsies are backing the Brotherhood. They are pushing their people to attack the Americans if they do not accept this new nation.. There are more Ramsies down there than the Prime Council is aware of, Captain. We've suspected it for years, but with all of this, I think that it's obvious how prevalent their influence is in the East.\"\nTraclin again nodded as he reached into his inside pocket and retrieved an Earth cigarette. Michael disapproved of the tobacco habit, but Traclin had been introduced to it some years before and found it extremely pleasurable. He lit it casually and then leaned further back into his seat. He looked at the 'Bounder once again as he thought of how the East and West were always at odds. He found it fascinating how the two hemispheres were so differently influenced by the two races of aliens. Maybe the Prime Council was right: maybe there was no \"meeting ground\".\n\"Yes,\" Traclin said as he leaned forward again as he blew out a ring of blue smoke, \"I'm well aware of the tensions and how influential America is as well as the Ramsies are to the East. I am also aware of how dangerous a Holy War could be to the entire world.. We could have the destruction of what we have worked so hard and waited so long for.\"\n\"Then, Imar,\" the 'Bounder continued as Traclin smiled at the reference to his relationship with Michael, \"Michael must realize how urgent it is that this situation be remedied.\"\n\"Imar or no, \" Traclin said as he stood and walked towards the window, \"I cannot influence Michael one way or the other.\" He glanced at the 'Bounder who sat looking quite dejected. \"Yet, there was a conference arranged on Delphi just a few hours ago. Indeed, I was present with Michael at the meeting. We were sent here with the blessings of the Prime Council to research the situation.\"\nThe 'Bounder rolled his eyes and stood abruptly. \"Look, Captain, I work for a news station in the American city of Boston. I've been here for nearly eighty Earth years, and let me tell you something that you can tell to the Prime Council: This situation is HOT. I mean absolutely HOT. We haven't had anything like this since the Cuban Missile Crisis, I promise you. We have to act soon... before America does and before the Ramsies do.\"\n\"The Ramsies will not act without the blessings of the Prime Council,\" even as he said it Traclin felt the disbelief growing within him. The Ramsies would act and everyone knew it.\n\"The entire world is sitting on the brink of a jihad, Imar,\" the 'Bounder said softly, reverting back to the respected spiritual title.\n\"The entire world, as you put it, can be adjusted if need be,\" Traclin replied solemnly, blowing yet another string of smoke rings into the darkness of the ceiling.\nThe 'Bounder laughed aloud despite his best efforts to control himself. \" Aren't you forgetting the Council, Imar? Adjustments are forbidden without their blessing.\"\n\"Most adjustments,\" Traclin said, propping himself on the desk directly in front of the 'Bounder, \"are forbidden, my dear Frommi.\"\nThe 'Bounder could not hide his surprise. \"Forbidden? But... how... who could dare defy the Council?\"\n\"The one who cares what happens to the people of the planet where you have made your home. Michael dares.\"\nTraclin stood, drew the last bit of tobacco through the filter, blew out the bluish smoke, threw it into his ashtray, and sat back down at his desk.\n\"Look,\" he said quietly, \"you're down there, seeing it all. We're here, there, almost all over the quadrant. That's why we need you, the 'Bounders, we need to know what the American government intends to do, and what the Ramsies intend to do. Can you do this?\"\n\"You ask for a tall order, Imar.\"\nTraclin frowned at the expression. The 'Bounder seemed to sense it and explained, \"You ask for a lot, Imar, perhaps more than I alone can deliver.\"\n\"Will you serve Michael?\"\n\"I always have, Imar, I am bound to him more than I am to anything in my life. I fear an adjustment, I must confess that to you, but I trust his judgment. I will return to the surface and do what I can.\" He rose then to go, bowed slightly, and whispered \"Salam Amar\". He reached the doorway and then hesitated.\n\"Something else?\" Traclin asked, still watching him.\n\"Yes, Imar. Faulkner, you know him?\"\nTraclin's stomach grew hard and cold at the name. \"I know the name, Frommi.\"\n\"He's the Adjustor from the assassinations of '63 and '68.\"\n\"Yes, go on,\" Traclin replied.\n\"He, too, is in Boston. I can also contact him, if you would like.\"\n\"The Fabric of the Cosmos has guided you, Frommi. The Future-Patterns were adjusted in our favor in '63 and '68,\" Traclin seemed to be thinking aloud, \"get a location for him and put him on standby. Salam Amar.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Of course, that's if you're driving a \"muscle car\", with lots of luck, no cops, and a full moon. Driving an 18-wheeler, it takes us considerably longer. We leave the terminal at 9 pm every Sunday and Thursday, with a full load of Gulf shrimp, and by midnight we're out in the Hill Country beyond San Antonio. Once we're past San Antone, the driving gets a lot easier.\nThere's not much traffic after midnight in west Texas or New Mexico, once you get out of the cities. In fact, there's not much of anything. On a cloudy, moonless night, it's so dark you can't see squat, out beyond the headlights. That's where it sometimes seems like the ragged edge of reality begins to fray, and the intersections between worlds start to show up in the darkness.\nOld timers always like to share tall tales over Texas chilli-bowl and jet-black truckstop coffee, stories about hooded night-riders, monsters or phantom trucks driven by demons, crazy nightmares they've seen on the road in the wee hours of the morning. When I first got my CDL, I thought they must have been using too many \"little white pills\" and funny cigarettes, but these guys and gals swore it was the truth. Old Santos, who's been driving the big rigs since before I was born, says that's why he always keeps a rosary hanging in his cab, \"for just in case,\" as he says. He warned me not to laugh too soon, because I would find out the truth for myself some day. I used to laugh at him.\nDuring my first couple years on the road, I bragged more than once that I had never seen any bogeymen, and not even a bogeywoman, which always got a laugh out of the truck-stop gang. Actually, aside from a couple of near-misses with deer, cattle and stalled four-wheelers, I hadn't see anything much out of the ordinary. True, I'd occasionally hear some weird stuff on the CB, mostly gabbling in languages that didn't sound like anything I'd ever heard before. But, when one of the gals at the shop explained about \"skip,\" sunspots, and radio signals bouncing in from all over the world, I quit worrying and just turned the CB off after midnight. After I got bored with playing and replaying all the music cassettes I owned, I started scanning the AM broadcast radio for a decent all-night country station that would keep me awake and alert while my old lady was back in the sleeper.\nIt was probably a month or so after I found the all-night truckers' program out of Window Rock, Arizona, when one night the radio went all crazy. It was about 2 am, and I couldn't hear Window Rock, Dallas, or even San Antonio. FM was dead, as it always is in west Texas. So, I set the AM on \"scan,\" to catch whatever I could hear. It stopped on a funny-sounding station, all quavery and full of static. I was ready to keep tuning, when the music was interrupted by a squawk that sounded like the emergency broadcast alert. I immediately turned up the volume. The sky was overcast, and Texas tornadoes can strike at any hour of the day or night. If there was a twister coming, I sure as heck wanted to find out about it, before it found us. Big rigs and high winds don't mix, believe me!\n\"This is an Emergency Alert System warning,\" intoned the announcer. \"Listeners in the Galveston and Orange, Texas areas should take cover immediately.\" I sighed with relief, thinking of the 400 miles or so separating me from the funnel-cloud, or whatever.\n\"Coastal radar has once again detected incoming cruise missiles fired by aggressor ships standing offshore in the Gulf. Civil Defense authorities warn that these may be targeted at refineries or chemical plants in the Galveston and Orange areas. All civilians should take cover at once. Our antiaircraft defense units have been activated, and the aggressors will not prevail! People of east Texas, stand firm! The West can and will win! We shall win total victory over aggression! Stay tuned to this channel for local Civil Defense instructions.\" The alert squawk was repeated, followed by a John Phillip Souza march.\nI yelled to my old lady, but she was back in the sleeper, dead to the world. I started to pull the rig off the road, but then thought the better of it. If World War III had really broken out, I'd better head for a town where we could get supplies and maybe shelter from fallout. The trailer-load of frozen shrimp we were carrying might make the difference between starvation and survival for some small town, if things were about to get as bad as it sounded on the radio. And then, if we could make it to Ft. Hancock or El Paso in the cab, there'd be an Army recruiting station where we could enlist \"for the duration.\" I punched the \"seek\" button on the radio, and was rewarded with a buzzing, warbly signal from another, stronger transmitter. A heavily-accented announcer was finishing what sounded like a prepared speech.\n\"... and if President Jackson and his gang do not order an immediate halt to their vicious ethnic cleansing, we will continue and intensify our air attacks. Hitting with surgical precision, we will smash his Army and Air Force facilities to rubble. We will cut his fuel and supply lines, degrade his communications and transport infrastructure, and ultimately eliminate the American ability to wage war. People of America! Do not listen to Jackson's lies. Do not follow your criminal leaders. Do not be a party to their genocide. The Cherokee deportations must stop! The refugees must be allowed to return to New Echota! Tune in for more news on this frequency at 0800 hours. Allied Command Radio One signing off. Good night.\"\nThe broadcast abruptly cut off, leaving my head swimming. I didn't have time to worry about it, though, since at that moment my headlights died, and every warning light on the dash panel flared red and then went black. The trailer started fishtailing, and I barely avoided a jackknife before fighting the rig to a stop in total darkness. Electromagnetic pulse, I thought. Stratospheric nuclear device. Gotta take cover. I ducked to the floor of the cab, trying my best to remember the Act of Contrition the catechism teacher tried to teach me in First Communion class so long ago. \"Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee...\" \"Oh God,\" I sweated, \"What the hell comes next?\"\nWhen I dared to look up, the headlights were back on. On the radio, WBAP in Fort Worth was broadcasting a humorous ad for truckers' ample jeans, followed by the Interstate Highway weather report for the western United States. Total normalcy. My old lady was climbing out of the sleeper in her long underwear, and turning the air blue with her language. I wanted to explain about the radio, but immediately thought the better of it. Instead, I made up a story about an animal in the road. She went grumbling back to the sleeper, shaking her head. The rig started like a dream, and after a deep breath I pulled into the westbound lane and got her back up to speed.\nThe morning sun was rising when I pulled the rig into the truckstop at Fort Hancock. The waitress spoke Mescalero, which was close enough to my native Lipan that I could almost understand her. I was ready to try a little friendly flirtation, when I caught the angry glare in my old lady's eyes and reconsidered. She's a Jumano from El Paso, and thinks all Apache women are loose, though she knows at heart I'd never have anyone else but her. As we were walking back to the rig, I looked around at the familiar, peaceful west Texas desert, and breathed an audible sigh of relief. \"I'm bushed,\" I mumbled over a yawn. The reflex was contagious. \"Don't you go giving me your sleepiness!\" she scolded with a laugh. \"I won't,\" I assured her, \"if you promise you won't wake me up until we're in sight of the Phoenix city walls!\" We laughed, kissed, and I handed her the keys. \"God,\" I whispered, \" it'll be good to get home!\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He tried to remember whether he had seen that sign before or not. Like so much of the scenery on the frequent trips to Sydney Airport, he was not really consciously aware of it. He was usually mentally reviewing the last meeting of the day, or contemplating the prospect of getting home again.\nAt the service desk, while checking on the possibility of an upgrade for his seat, he asked the attractive, uniformed girl behind the desk if she had ever noticed the sign.\n\"What sign, Mr. Crewe? No, I can't say I've ever seen it.\" Brian put it out of his mind, as he walked over to the bar for a quiet gin and tonic while waiting for the plane.\nSome weeks later, as he quietly sipped an early cup of coffee in the lounge at Tullamarine, Brian's attention was diverted from the newspaper by an announcement over the PA. \"Would Mr. Miller, passenger on flight 416 to Sydney, please report to the service desk.\"\n\"Huh!\" thought Brian, the name triggering a memory, \"I wonder what he looks like?\" He looked back down at his paper, not taking the thought seriously. A little later, the boarding call came, and he pushed away his empty cup and walked off to the departure lounge.\n\"... so, I'm sure you will agree, that if we accept the results of the trial as indicative, we should see some true business benefits achieved by the full implementation of the new system.\" Brian was pleased with the results of the presentation. The MD personally thanked him, and promised sign-off at the next board meeting. He smiled quietly to himself as the taxi battled the Friday night traffic down Botany Road.\n\"You're pretty happy with that, Brian?\" asked Kevin.\n\"Sorry? Oh, yeah. I didn't expect such a quick response from them, I must say. Your explanation of the changes in the technology really helped, too.\"\n\"No worries,\" responded Kevin. \"That's why I'm part of the team - hey, that must be their Alexandria office there.\" The taxi crawled past a large industrial site.\n\"Yes, that's it,\" confirmed Brian. Suddenly, another sign caught Brian's eye. \"Kevin, what's 'Miller'?\"\n\"What's who?\"\n\"Oh, it's probably nothing. I've seen that sign a few times, but I have no idea who or what it's about. I don't even know why it's caught my eye.\"\n\"What sign? asked Kevin, \"I can't say I've noticed it. After all, I don't get up here as often as you do.\"\n\"Never mind. You've got your work cut out for you now, getting the delivery schedule arranged ...\" The conversation wandered back into business. Later, at the lounge, while talking about their respective plans for the weekend, Brian just caught part of the announcement: \"... please report to the service desk. Mr Miller.\"\nThat night, as they walked to the bedroom after a late tea, Brian said to his wife: \"Funny coincidence. I keep hearing the name 'Miller'.\"\n\"Oh?\" said Michelle, \"What about it?\"\n\"It just seemed an odd coincidence.\"\n\"Uh huh. We had a Mr. Miller in our office today. Business consultant, down from Sydney.\"\n\"Really? There was a Miller on the plane down tonight.\"\n\"Couldn't have been the same one, then.\"\n\"No, I guess not. What time do the kids need to be at this party tomorrow?\"\nSometimes, the mind can play strange tricks on us. Insignificant, unrelated things can appear to become overwhelmingly important and meaningful, and take on strange new meanings. There was a story once about a 'roadie' for a rock band, who finally figured out why microphone leads always seem to disappear, and power cords seem to accumulate. He explained his theory to his sceptical colleagues, but got short shrift. One day, a new bass amplifier just appeared on stage after a show, as if by magic. Before our hero was able to convince anyone of his discovery of a new form of evolution, he was found back-stage - dead. Hanging from a power cord.\nBrian dredged through his e-mail. \"How can I possibly have 60 new messages?\" he demanded of Louise, his Sales Assistant in the next office cubicle.\n\"Well, you have been in Perth all week.\"\n\"But I was checking my mail on my lap-top!\"\n\"Obviously not often enough. Did you get the one about the presentation by Miller?\"\n\"Miller? No, who's that?\"\n\"They are the new multi-media company we are entering a joint venture with\" advised Louise.\n\"Never heard of them. But I've certainly heard the name before.\"\n\"Really? They're fairly new.\"\n\"Never mind. I can't see the message. I must have deleted it already. I can't afford the time to go to all these free lunches.\"\n\"Okay. I've heard that they are pretty good operators. The Sydney office saw them last week. Everybody was impressed.\"\n***\n\"Now, Belinda, it's time to turn off your light and go to sleep.\"\n\"But, Daddy ...\" she pouted.\n\"No, that's enough reading now. You can finish your book tomorrow night.\"\n\"But Mr. Miller said we have to finish it by tomorrow!\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Mr. Miller. He's our temporary teacher. Ms. Ritchie is having a baby, remember!\"\n\"Oh, yes. I forgot. Anyway, it's too late to read any more.\"\n\"When's Mummy coming home?\"\n\"She'll be home tomorrow, when you get home from school.\"\n\"Oh, good. I miss Mummy.\"\n\"She's only been away at her conference for two days.\"\n\"I know. But I still miss her.\"\n\"Okay. Good night.\"\n\"Good night, Daddy.\"\nBrian dimmed the light, and gently closed the door. He went off to the study to finish typing up a sales report. He looked at his watch. Michelle should have finished dinner by now. On cue, the phone rang. He picked it up quickly, before the noise disturbed the children.\n\"Hi darling!\"\n\"Hi. How's the conference?\"\n\"Good. Tiring, though. I'm going straight to bed.\"\n\"What? You're not staying up partying all night?\"\n\"Ha ha! I don't think so!\"\n\"How was your dinner?\"\n\"Great. I was talking to John over dinner. He's very entertaining.\"\nBrian felt slightly miffed. \"John?\"\n\"You know, John Miller, the business consultant.\"\n\"Oh, right. Did you say Miller?\"\n\"Yes, he's been facilitating our business planning session this afternoon.\"\nIf I hear that name again today, I'll scream, thought Brian. \"Okay. Busy day tomorrow?\"\n\"Yes and no. Golf for most of it. John's offered to teach me how to play.\"\n\"How nice. I thought you couldn't stand the game?\"\n\"Maybe it's time I changed. Might help my career.\"\nJohn changed the subject. Eventually they said goodnight, and he put down the phone.\nThe world of dreams is a strange place, where reality blurs, and everything seems perfectly logical. When you wake up fully, you realise how unreal things were in that limbo of the mind. As the dream-world slips from your grasp, you laugh about how it could ever have seemed real.\nBrian was restless. He couldn't get comfortable. Dreams faded in and out. He was at a service desk in an airport. The man at the desk looked up and asked if he was Mr. Miller.\n\"No, I'm Brian Crewe.\"\n\"That's all right, Mr. Miller. We had a message for you, that's all.\"\n\"No, I said my name is not Miller.\"\nHe was handed a phone. The voice on the other end said that there was a call from Miller, would he hold the line, please?\nBelinda tugged at his sleeve. She said, \"Look at my picture, Mr. Miller.\"\nThen he was walking into his office.\n\"Why's the company sign been changed, Louise?\"\n\"Didn't you know? We are now working for the new company; the joint venture with Miller.\"\nThe phone was in his hand again. He was asking to speak to Mrs. Crewe, please.\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the receptionist. \"She's in a meeting with Mr. Miller. Can I ask her to call you back?\"\nBrian woke up suddenly, in a sweat. He stumbled out of bed, and got a drink of water. He tried to make some sense of the dream, but it receded from his memory as he grappled with it.\nThe next day in the office, he asked his colleague what was happening with the new joint venture.\n\"This supposed to be a big secret, you know,\" Kevin warned him. \"Don't spread it too far. But from what I've heard, they have their own sales force. I'm a bit worried that some of us mightn't be around for much longer.\"\n\"You're joking! I haven't heard anything like that. I thought it was just a joint venture.\"\n\"Sure,\" said Kevin. \"That's where it started. But it looks like going a lot further than that.\"\n\"We'd better look busy. You know that Sydney deal looks like unravelling.\"\n\"That's bad news, Brian. What happened?\"\n\"I don't know. It started going bad as soon as this Miller thing started up.\"\n\"Hey - you said something about a sign on the way back from that meeting in Sydney. Must have been a bad omen.\"\n\"I don't believe in omens,\" said Brian, \"but I'm starting to wish I hadn't seen it.\"\nBrian felt ill as he drove home from the office that night. Suddenly, everything seemed to go dark.\nStress can kill. Threats and fears that have no tangible reality can take on enormous proportions in our mind. Sometimes, we can consciously combat these fears. Other times, we are not even aware of the chimaeric nature of these fears. Our body doesn't know the difference. The feared, imagined world is reality, and the body acts accordingly.\nHe woke up in a hospital bed, feeling somewhat disoriented. Michelle faded into view.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Don't you remember?\" Michelle asked anxiously. \"You had a car accident last night. We've been very worried.\"\nBrian gradually became aware of a variety of aches and pains. There was a plaster on his leg. Michelle smiled bravely at him.\nOver the next few days, Brian slowly recovered. Doctors talked to him about stress, and the need to review his lifestyle. He could see green grass outside his hospital window. He couldn't remember the last time he had paid attention to such a view.\nKevin came in to tell him how much they missed him in the office. \"You know that merger thing? It's all off. Nobody seems to know why. We finally got approval for the Sydney project, too.\"\n\"Great. Although, somehow I find it hard to get excited just at the moment.\"\nThe doctor talked to Brian about taking some extended leave from work. \"I'm taking a few weeks off myself, next week,\" he said.\nThe children came in often. Belinda was bursting with the news that Ms. Ritchie was back at school, and had brought in her new baby to show everyone. Michelle talked about her work occasionally. \"It's just as well you have plenty of paid sick leave, and that medical insurance is covering everything. I wouldn't be keen to go back full time.\"\n\"I thought you wanted to advance your career?\"\n\"Well, sometimes. But I like to have time at home. The kids have really needed me this last little while.\"\n\"What about all that business planning you were working on?\"\nMichelle paused. \"Well, that seems to have gone quiet. That consultant has changed jobs, and gone overseas. Everyone seems to have lost interest in that now.\"\nBrian was lying back in his bed that night, slowly drifting off to a peaceful sleep. The nurse came in and checked his pulse, and gave him his medication. As Brian settled down, she slid the card with the departing doctor's name out of the holder at the head of the bed, and replaced it with a card for the new doctor. It read \"Dr. Miller.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Traclin had moved his ship further away from Earth to insure no detection even though the Brotherhood of Arab Nations had been demanding that the United Nations officially acknowledge them and the Americans and now Great Britain had been pushing just as hard to investigate the coalition before any official statement was released.\n\"We must consider all possibilities,\" Michael told Traclin via the monitor screen.\nTraclin silently agreed as he lit another cigarette. He turned back to the screen to be greeted with the disapproving face of his mentor. Michael's face was almost surreal in its beauty and wisdom. Traclin always felt rather meek when he looked his leader directly in the eyes. As Traclin prepared to sign off, Michael's smooth voice spoke again. Traclin's eyes moved once again to those of Michael's and the intensity nearly burned a hole into the mirror of Traclin's soul.\n\"Imar,\" Michael said, surprising Traclin since the two of them generally avoided official titles, \"it is never pleasant to inflict death and pain, but remember the means to which we strive: The Ramsies control much of the Eastern hemisphere. We may never be sure of how many there are or what exactly they control. Yet, we can be sure of this: The evil which holds the future in jeopardy right at this moment is not our doing. And,\" the voice suddenly sounded very hollow, \"if a Holy War, or jihad, erupts, then we will have the next world war on our hands. The East and West will once again be fighting over their spiritual sanctity. If the Coalition of Arabs, with the help of the Ramsies, prevail and move in to control any of the West, we will be forced to abandon Earth; we cannot control the entire planet from a distance, and the Ramsies will never allow us to return. We need an action- adjustment. Perhaps it may have to be one that is similar to our infamous actions from this century; but, whatever the call is for, I need Faulkner at my disposal.\"\n\"Michael, how do we know that the Ramsies don't already control some of the West? The government of America is not as strong militarily as it once was. They used to be more action-oriented themselves.\"\n\"Yes, certainly another consideration. Contact Faulkner. I want to speak with him myself.\"\nTraclin could not even mumble the proper farewell before the transmission went dead.\nAt dawn the next Earth day, Faulkner transferred to the Dalphi craft. Reports were rolling in from 'Bounders revealing a military buildup in the Brotherhood of Arab Nations. They had armies on the move already. The Americans and British were responding appropriately. And the Pope had released a statement. Tensions were high on Earth as well as on the Dalphi ship.\nTraclin was sitting behind his desk feeling both unsure and rather weary. He hadn't slept at all since the mission had begun. He nervously smoked at he watched the world turn just beyond his window.\nFaulkner entered the office quietly and moved with cool, liquid motion. He wore what Earthlings called jeans and a shirt very similar to the one that the 'Bounder had worn the day before. Traclin frowned again as he still failed to recall what the clothing was named. Faulkner's shirt had words on it that read, \"Save the Whales\", and his hair was shoulder length and unkempt. His face was unshaven and he looked so very pale. He sat down opposite Traclin in a nonchalant way. He offered no greeting.\n\"Salam Ishi, Brother,\" Traclin said, watching his face.\n\"I was told that Michael wanted to see me,\" Faulkner replied, waving the greeting aside like a foul odor.\nTraclin nodded. \"We may need an Action-Adjustment. Similar to your last assignment.\"\nFaulkner nodded. His eyes did not flicker nor did his face change expression.\n\"We assume that you remain loyal to Michael and Dalphi,\" he said.\n\"Not all of those who are loyal to Michael are loyal to Dalphi, nor are those that are loyal to Dalphi loyal to Michael. It's not the same thing anymore, Imar. We may be far away and sometimes forgotten by you, but we still hear and know. There are those who stop by and have lunch with us as they travel the stars,\" Faulkner smiled a bit, \"but we cannot be tempted to follow because others do. Michael taught us that. I follow whom I want.\"\n\"Then, whom do you serve, Faulkner?\"\n\"Some Adjustors have become simple assassins, did you know that? They kill and wound for whoever can pay the top dollar. They've forgotten about the Future-Patterns, or they don't care. Even the Ramsies have hired some of your so-called 'Bounders and Adjustors to do their dirty work because we are better trained than they are. But,\" Faulkner seemed to shrink in his chair, \"I remain loyal to Michael and his teachings. I serve the Cosmos. I adjust for the Future-Patterns. I want to live in open alliance with Earthlings. I never got to do that, you know? For two millennia we have been here in secret, even my father died without seeing the alliance restored. I've watched the Ramsies gain power and I've wondered if Michael is aware of what he's up against down there. I've seen the Ramsies build up the East and gain power ten to one over us. I'm not going to let them overthrow the Future- Patterns that I adjusted before with this situation that is going on now. They could do it, too, you know? They could revert us right back to the state that we were in back in the '40s and '50s. Paranoia. Fear. Imminent destruction. The Ramsies have not had this opportunity since the A-Bomb came about, and that, let me remind you, with all due respect, came about because Michael wouldn't get rid of Hitler! Anyway,\" he paused again, \"to put it simply. I serve Michael. I serve his purpose.\"\nTraclin simply nodded. He went to retrieve the message capsule that Michael had sent and noticed that his hands were sweaty with nervousness. He wiped them on his trousers and then remembered the name for the Earth clothing.\n\"Sweats,\" he mumbled, shaking his head and handing the capsule to Faulkner.\n\"Pardon?\" Faulkner said, taking the small, metallic tool.\nTraclin shook his head and pointed to the capsule. \"No one has seen it but Michael. Not even me.\"\nFaulkner nodded as he rose to leave.\n\"Salam Amar, Brother,\" Traclin whispered.\nFaulkner turned and raised his hand, \"Salam Amar.\"\n\"We have received a dreadful piece of news,\" Michael said as Traclin became glued to the monitor, \"the Ramsies have contacted the Prime Council and warned us against trying any type of adjustment at all. They claim to have someone very close to the American president and will act if we do not retreat immediately. They, in effect, are holding us hostage from acting.\"\nTraclin was shocked. \"It could be a lie.\"\nMichael looked grim. \"No, I am afraid not, Traclin. Our sources reveal that they are truthful. They have at least one adviser in the White House.\"\n\"Then,\" Traclin asked, \"we will retreat?\"\n\"You must contact Faulkner and cancel the adjustment.\"\nTraclin averted his gaze for a quick moment. So, the spiritual leader had ordered another adjustment without the approval of the Council. A sudden rush of emotion surged through Traclin.\n\"Then we give up what ground we do have? The Ramsies are in the White House, Michael, we can't simply leave them there.\"\nThis time it was Michael that looked away. For an awkward moment, the two Dalphites could not speak.\n\"Get Faulkner to your ship immediately. There may yet be a way,\" Michael ordered. \"I'll contact you again in one Earth hour.\"\nTraclin stood next to his window tapping his fingers nervously on the wall. He bit his lip absent mindedly as he stared intently at the Earth. The word \"time\" kept banging in his head as a single drop of blood formed on his lower lip. Making a fist and lightly bumping the window, he stepped away and tried to calm himself. After all the years of watching, waiting, hoping, and striving for the ultimate alliance between the peoples...\n\"Not now,\" he said between clenched teeth. He began to pace the floor.\nThe door slid open and Faulkner entered in a rush. He was dressed in a dark business suit and carried a large briefcase. He stopped just inside the office and looked expectantly at Traclin.\n\"Well?\" He said in a strained voice. \"There I am, poised to carry out my orders, and suddenly I'm jerked back up here. Can you tell me what is going on?\"\n\"Someone wants to talk with you,\" Traclin said, walking to the monitor and flipping it to the \"on\" position. Faulkner followed him and sat down in Traclin's chair.\nMoments later, Michael's face appeared before them.\n\"We can retreat and leave the Earth to the mercy of the Ramsies; or, we can attempt an adjustment without the Blessings of the Council. The adjustment must be altered, however. It is imperative, Faulkner, \" the Adjustor shivered at the sound of his name, \"that you follow my orders with the preciseness of a finely sharpened blade...\"\nTraclin sat in the darkness of space that filled his office. The only light came from the planet below. The paleness reflected off of Traclin's face as he blew out yet another train of smoke rings into the smoky atmosphere. He blinked his eyes slowly and tapped his cigarette on the lip of the ashtray.\nThe sliding of his door did not disturb him. He slowly turned his head and saw the Earthbounder, still wearing sweats, although a different color, standing near the door. The 'Bounder smiled subtlety and approached the desk. He handed Traclin a small, rectangular black object.\n\"Salam Ishi,\" he said.\n\"Ishi Salam,\" Traclin replied, taking the object.\n\"It's a videotape of tonight's broadcast from my station. I think that you'll find it enlightening.\"\nTraclin quickly inserted the tape into the converter. He hesitated to play it for a moment, but then hurriedly turned it to the \"play\" position as if the converter were burning his hand.\nThe screen of the monitor came alive with faces and words, but none of it really reached Traclin. After the tape ended, he looked at the 'Bounder with a frown on his face.\n\"My English is not good, at least not this fast,\" he confessed.\n\"Ah,\" the 'Bounder replied, \"well, the President of the United States was shot today - an attempted assassination. They missed, though, and hit someone else: one of his top advisers. The beauty of it is: No one was killed. Perfect. The Prime Council cannot prosecute because there was no crime!\"\nTraclin shrugged. \"I don't even know if this is what Michael wanted.\"\n\"No. But, it is done. You must return and so must I. May I keep this?\"\nThe 'Bounder nodded as he rose to leave. \"Sure, Imar, but, tell me, are we going to... are we going to stay?\"\nTraclin nodded. \"At least for now.\"\nMichael signalled almost immediately. Traclin showed him the tape and the leader seemed pleased.\n\"Quite successful. Very, very good indeed. The Future-Patterns reveal a break so large it will take the Ramsies twenty years or longer to stitch it together again, if they choose to do so. And, for us, a chance to replace those that are close to the leaders of the West.\" Michael seemed elated.\n\"So,\" Traclin stammered as he jerked his eyes to the window, \"the West is set for us; what about the East? The Brotherhood is still strong. A jihad could still take place. It seems to me that we have weakened the Americans.\"\n\"Our Adjustment was carried out exactly as planned,\" Michael insisted, \"Faulkner was exquisite. No one is dead; yet, the Ramsie is no longer a threat to the American government. As for the East, well, I have a plan for that as well. Faulkner caught a plane to Median this evening. Patience, Imar, trust me.\"\nTraclin nodded his head and felt a mixture of relief and satisfaction. He looked out the window once again, but this time he found no hope nor happiness for the future. This time, an empty, wrenching feeling overcame him. His mouth became dry and the bitter taste of doubt flavored his tongue. He tried to swallow and nearly choked. He couldn't help but wonder: Were they right, Ramsie or Dalphite, to exercise such power over this beautiful world? The question numbed his mind.\nHe painfully turned his gaze back to the screen. With a sweep of emotions ranging from happiness to confusion then to understanding, he turned off his end of the already dead transmission from Dalphi.\n\"Salam Amar.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

More people trying to win is just more people who can use my services.\nI picked my guy soon enough and strode over to him. The fact that I was looking right at him must have thrown him off guard - that and the dress. I like the dress. It brings out all the right curves on me. A wise investment, that dress. Haven't had to pay for a drink yet.\nAnd that's the first thing he offered, to buy me a drink. I don't like drinking while I'm working, though. I might have one later, after we've won, but I think alcohol affects my abilities adversely.\nAfter we had gotten over the drink issue, I offered my services. He asked me if I was a dancer and I explained to him that he wasn't going to see me without the dress. So, he asked just what my services were and I explained. We worked out terms - my usual ten percent first time and twenty-five for repeat customers and headed to the black-jack table. Only card games. No chance game - not my field.\nThe moment we sat down, I felt the dealer start it up. Most of the dealers at this casino were that way, so my skills were needed here. I let him do his first wash, but the moment the cards were dealt I put up my field. The dealer wasn't concentrating on us yet, and started bidding.\n\"Ante up, ladies and gentlemen. Ante up.\"\nThat's usually my cue to start fielding.\nI liked my client. He was a good player and didn't take stupid risks. Damn! he was a good bluff.\nWe cleaned out the black-jack table and headed off to five card draw. That's one thing about the dealers here - they rely to heavily on their talents, so when someone like myself comes along they show their true colors. They really are crappy dealers. I mean that. No pun.\nMy client had calmed down and it only improved his game. Now that the dealers couldn't get in his head, he was breaking them left and right. Usually, I can't find clients like that. I could see why he came to a casino and I'll bet in the old days he was a regular player. Not now, though. Too much talent out there for a guy like that to make it. Too much talent out there for him to stay afloat without a field like me.\nHalf-way through our stay at the draw table, one of my old clients came up. The guy was no good, even with a field he lost.\n\"Jesse, I need you.\"\n\"Scram.\"\nMy client had been dealt his cards, but didn't pick them up yet. Yeah, I liked this guy. He was smart. He knew I couldn't keep it up with a sweaty shmuck breathing down my back.\n\"Jesse, please.\"\n\"You can't play for crap.\"\n\"I'll pay you twice as much as usual.\"\n\"I don't care. Fifty percent of nothing is still nothing. Get lost.\"\nAnd that's when the slime-ball touched me. He put a spongy hand on my arm and tried to pull me from the table. I don't dig off on creeps touching me, period; but, especially when I'm in the dress and especially when I'm working.\nMy client was right there for me - protecting his own interests. He dug a thumb into the lard-ball's wrist and informed him in a calm easy voice, \"The lady doesn't want you to bother her. Please refrain from doing so or I'll call security and have you removed.\"\nA lady he calls me. Wow. The guy was a charmer and I adored every moment of it. I almost felt like one of those princesses that people fight over.\nThe creep backed off and split. My client leaned over to me and in a calm, smooth voice said, \"Okay, the distraction's gone. Back to work, girlie.\"\nSo, it was really more like two dogs fighting over a scrap of meat. Oh-well.\nAt the end of the night, my client paid me my ten percent and I made my offer: \"Now that you've seen what I can do, maybe next time you come by here, you can pay me what I'm worth.\"\nHe looked me up and down and sneered. \"How about I buy you a decent dress, so you don't look like a painted whore.\"\nOkay, that was it. First the girlie routine, then that. I took my cut, told him where to shove the rest, and got my stuff from Sandy, the coat-check girl. Sandy's a good girl - I like her. She's just trying to make an honest buck - no talent at all. Also, she got me the fake ID that let me into the casino. Eighteen and up only. Fascists. Almost as bad as my parents.\nI changed in the bathroom and headed out to catch the last pub-trans home. I had to beat the curfew, so there wasn't any time to sit around. And homework, I had homework before class tomorrow. Pain. Nothing but crap that would never help me get buy. All my life-skills I learned at home. Screw school. They can't each you what I can do.\nThe client was waiting at the curb and offered me a ride home. I was amazed he could recognize me. One minute in a dress with long blonde hair - next I'm in boots and coat with short black hair. I bought the wig to match the ID. Makes me look older. Helps me get by.\nI told him to shove it, I don't ride with peds. So he said, fine, whatever, and started to walk off. I made my way to the station and he swung around and pressed something into my hand.\n\"I'll make it worth your while.\"\nI just stood there. Bastard had jumped me. He had. Freaked my shit good. Moved too fast. He had my wrist just like that. Made me open my hand by giving it a twist.\nI watched him leave with clenched fists. I don't like being touched by creeps.\nSchool went okay, I guess. Third period my friend Tom fried his machine. He does it on purpose, I think. Because he can. The week before that, it was the teacher's machine. One moment we're all watching the model and learning chemistry, next thing we're staring at a screen that says \"no system files\". We all knew it was him. They knew it. He's got talent.\nThere's a lot of talent at the school. There's a lot of talent everywhere. My parents were so unhappy when I tested negative. They were so hoping. They have special schools for talent. No schools for fields though. My brother has talent, not me. My parents like him.\nDad was on me the moment I came home asking about why a teacher would be calling. I had started fielding the moment I got home, so he only had half the story.\n\"Why don't you wait until the teach calls.\"\n\"I want to know now.\"\n\"Don't be so impatient. You can find out the way the rest of us do: when it happens.\"\n\"Wait until your mother gets home, young lady!\"\nJust for being a puss-ass I doubled the field so that he wouldn't know about the marbles in the back room. He had been home all day with my brother and hadn't found them yet. I knew that for sure. If he had found them, I would have heard about it.\nMom came home soon enough, but not soon enough for dad. He's impatient and twitchy and it drives me nuts. Things have to happen for him now - yesterday - the day before that - whenever. He's spent most of his life waiting for something to happen. He's fatalistic, too. Drives me batty.\nSo, Mom got home and Dad had to talk to her because I was fielding double-time. She tuned in on me and tried to pull it all out but she couldn't get past my frown. Then she tried to make me feel bad about the whole thing but I was drowning her out and it bounced and hit Dad. He was into his first half-hour of apologizing and Mom couldn't calm him. I made sure. That's what you get for playing god, Mom.\nAn hour after dinner, the call from the teacher came. Mom spoke with her and wouldn't tell Dad any of the conversation, which is why he knew she had called, but not why. He was begging her for the information, just to know if he was right. She said she'd talk to him tomorrow, she had to go to work, and:\n\"I'm very angry with you and you know why.\"\nMy parents are royal flakes. My dad works with investment bankers telling them where the market's going. Mom works this crappy-ass job in marketing selling dresses to over-weight women. When she's not at work, she's busy \"volunteering\" at the local Hypnogouge as a tela-prompter. It's bull-shit. It's like the new religion; everyone gets pumped full of psycho-reactive drugs and shit-heads like my mom plant suggestions in their head. The Hypnogouge in our area has five tela-prompters. Like they need to invest that much in broadcasting. I'm amazed the folks there haven't had their minds turned to mush.\nI don't like anyone having that much influence over anyone. I might not do my homework, but I pay attention. I know history. I know what power like that can do. One of these days, they're going to stop preaching the happy peace love feel-good and find a scape-goat for all of society's woes. Maybe the clays; no-one likes them. I don't like maniacs like my mom putting thoughts in people's heads. My mom's a psycho.\nScrew it, I'm saving up for my own place anyway.\nSo. Mom left for Hypnogouge and Dad had to go in the back room to get something for my creep brother. I guess it's a good thing Chip went with him and caught Dad before he hit the floor. What I don't understand is how Chip can catch something that big when he wouldn't be able to lift Dad by himself. Brain versus brawn I tell myself.\nChip set Dad down and came after me. More fielding. I've done it before. My brother has tamper tantrums like that all the time. I know I don't help situations, but if he wants to throw something at me, he better learn to pick them up. I'm not afraid of him. Not now. I'm leaving home before he reaches puberty, though. I ain't sticking around for that hell.\nI grabbed the pub-trans and rode out to the casino. I went to the bathroom and put on my costume. Sandy was behind the counter at the coat-check and I gave her my bag and a healthy tip. I like Sandy; she's done a lot for me. We help each other out. It's in our best interests.\nAnyway, a repeat customer came up and we headed for the tables. He got a few hands, but he had to leave early. His wife wanted him home for her birthday, he told me, so he paid me my share and split.\nThen my client from the night before showed. I explained my price had gone up and it was thirty percent for a return play. He agreed and we started clearing out the black-jack dick again. Two nights in a row and the bastard hadn't learned. He wasn't a very good talent to begin with. I hate amateurs.\n\"Ante-up, ladies and gentlemen. Ante-up.\"\nWe cleaned that dealer good and walked over to the bar.\n\"I'm glad you made it tonight. I needed to talk to you about something,\" it was the client jabbering. \"How would you like a forty percent contract?\"\nI told him I didn't play contracts. I don't like games that go on for hours. Did it once before for a skinny guy who played weekend poker with his friends. They spotted me right away and told him straight up no girls allowed in the game. Contracts ask me to play, to, and I can't play poker for shit. I'm no good at bluffing; never learned how to lie right. You can't lie to someone like my mom..\n\"No, this isn't like that. It's a big game and you don't have to play. I'll pay you a flat fee to serve drinks, then add a percentage of the winnings. Forty percent's a good deal, considering.\"\n\"Considering what?\"\n\"Considering the stakes.\"\nI hate contracts like that. That's what the last guy had said to me. Sure, I had a high percentage but the winnings were too small and I couldn't get out of the game quickly enough. By the time I made it out, it was after curfew and I almost got busted.\n\"My chauffeur will drive you, so you don't need to worry about curfew.\"\nI hate contracts. And I hate talents. This guy had been reading me the moment I let down my field. He probably worked for the casino as a stake-out for people like me. That's what I get for not fielding when I'm talking to a complete stranger.\n\"It will help you get more money saved up so you can get your own place.\"\nI know I blanched. I was hot and shaky and felt the sweat forming on my upper lip.\n\"No, I'm not talented like that. I rely on something a little more old fashioned - observation.\"\n\"Okay, Sherlock,\" I was pissed. \"Tell me how you figured that one out.\"\n\"Easy,\" he smiled. \"You're too young - chalk that down to that fake ID - to be living in your own place. You're not on any drugs and you legally couldn't own a vehicle. What else would you be working so hard towards? I'm guessing you're coming up on a birthday here soon. You're saving up.\"\nHe smiled again, but I wanted to shove my fingers in his eyes. I was fielding triple time and he still caught my fist.\n\"I used to box. You pulled back to far for that punch and you thew your arm too slowly.\"\nI was furious. He was humiliating me and everything I stood for. I'm a field for chrissakes! One of the best. No talent should be able to get past me.\nHe leaned back and crossed his arms. \"How'd you get your talent anyway?\"\n\"It's not talent.\"\n\"It's a talent. A talent I'm willing to pay highly for. How'd you get it?\"\n\"I got tired of my mom getting in my head. I got tired of my dad always knowing what I was going to do. I got tired of being thrown around the room by my baby brother. Need I go on?\"\nHe rubbed his chin and stared at the floor. \"So you can counter-act all three forms, huh?\"\nI started to get antsy. \"Look, mister. You're not playing. As long as you don't play, that's less in the end for me. Let's go to the draw-five table.\"\nHe dug in his pocket and pulled out a fifty credit coin. \"Here, if it'll ease your mind any. \"\n\"I don't take hand-outs. I get paid for services-rendered.\"\nHe grabbed my hand and forced it open with that wrist-twist of his. \"Take the god-damn coin. That's your retainer fee. Do you still have my card?\"\nI rubbed my wrist and nodded.\n\"Fine. You call me tomorrow at five. My chauffeur will pick you and give you your instructions. And you can leave your silly casino costume at home. We don't deal with that kind.\"\nHe gave me my cut of the winnings and walked away. I felt I had done pretty well for the night and got my bag back from Sandy. Sandy got a good tip that night. I like her.\nPub-trans was running behind schedule and I almost missed curfew. If they want to give us hell about staying out late, they should at least make sure the stupid pub-trans will run on time. I think it should be free, too. Most kids don't have money. Well, not like I have money.\nMom was waiting up for me, the bitch. I could feel her ten feet from the door.\nShe started right on me the moment I hit the door. I wasn't doing my homework, I was failing my classes, I was acting up in school....\nI could explain the acting up part easy. I'm honest, brutally so. I come from a family where there are no lies, no covering up. I don't go for manners and crap like that. \"To be gentile,\" they say, \"You must conceal and not reveal just how you feel.\" Yeah, right, like anything can be concealed from a talent like Mom.\nThen she starts going on about how I'll never be successful. I'm no good in school and I'm not talented, according to her. How will I ever get by in life? She wanted to know.\nSo I told her. Mom, hey, calm down. I've got a job and it pays me well enough to get me away from you. I'm moving out in three weeks, so don't give me any more lip.\nMove out? She asked. To where? You can't afford the double deposit they'll want from you.\nYeah, well, that's where you're wrong. I've been saving up for the past year and you can't touch it, I made sure.\nI told her that to her face and she started to cry. My poor baby's leaving home. My darling little girl! Boo-hoo and such. \"I don't know how I'll go on without you.\"\nI had had enough. \"Jeeze, Mom. You've got Chip. It's not like the house is going to be empty anyway. Anyway, what you want a no-talent trouble-maker like me around for?\"\nAnd she started to explain how much help I'd been and how wonderful it was to have me around. How I'd helped with the family budget, because I was the only one with a head for numbers. I was the only one that saved receipts and kept our access from being cut off. I was the only one who knew how to put out the fire that Chip had started in his crib. I was their godsend.\n\"Why, I was just reading the other day about how most talents will even hire people to take care of them. If you leave, that's what we'll have to do. I just know we can't take care of ourselves.\"\nThat's when I realized she'd been working on me the whole time, hoping I'd drop. That pissed me off. My own mother was trying to guilt trip me into staying and playing house servant to them.\n\"That's why you had me,\" I snapped. \"You decided to have a no-talent to take care of you and dad and Chip. You had to have me first because you knew you'd never be able to take care of a baby on your own!\"\nMan, I remember that and I let the image form perfectly in my head, the way it had been ten years ago, when I came home from school to find my baby brother Chip screaming in his crib and my mom laying on the floor, unable to move because Chip was turning her stomach inside out. A hungry baby is a cranky baby and Mom and Dad were helpless without me to protect them. I dropped and I let her see that nice and clear.\nShe recoiled, then held her hands out to me and in her super-sad voice cried out, \"I'm your mother! I love you. You know that. You know I love you, don't you honey? I would never do something to hurt my baby. You're the most important thing I have in the world. You're my little extension of me. You're my chance at immortality!\"\nJust that thought made me sick. I fielded hard enough to rattle her head.\n\"I'm going to bed, Mom. Gotta go to school tomorrow and work on being a successful member of society. Might be late coming back. Don't mess with my dreams while I'm sleeping; I wouldn't put it past you. \"\nI started off for my room and turned for my final blow.\n\"Let me know if you have an original thought any time soon. That must be why Dad likes you so much. You're so predictable.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Doesn't that make you feel all warm inside?\"\nThin Joey always looked funny, for he never removed his Red Tank headgear. Its information glass floated just over one eye, shooting electronic info right into his retinas. \"It's just getting scarier, Frank,\" he answered, glancing at me. \"But what else is new? He'll just draft more Martian boys like us.\"\nI looked at the news console. The latest article read: \"Scientists Desperately Trying to Determine Foe.\" The article quoted one scientist, \"We still know next to nothing about the Phantoms. Who and where are they? What do they want?\"\nAs usual, the damned scientists didn't know squat. I changed articles. My eyes strayed momentarily to the picture I kept by the monitor. No fancy chick, just a humble picture of my little brother. I hoped he was having fun.\n\"Hey!\" Joey sounded tense. \"I got something! Two thirty-four degrees and closing!\"\n\"Ah, damn it.\" I keyed the intercom. \"George? George, you there? George!\"\n\"Wha-huh-oh, it's you. Can't a guy get some sleep?\"\n\"You're supposed to be driving this damned thing, asshole. Get it off autopilot and grab the stick! Joey's got something.\"\n\"A Phantom?\"\n\"What the hell else do you think it is?\" I shouted, grabbing the VR helmet from the dashboard and jamming onto my head. Instantly my vision was scrambled, then I was floating in the air above the charging tank, and in the distance were two black dots. I ordered magnification and the dots zoomed into two black tanks.\nPhantoms.\nI cut the magnification. \"Two thirty nine and closing!\" Joey called.\n\"I hear you, I hear you!\" said George, \"Disengaging autopilot.\"\nI felt the huge tank turn, I saw it twisting below my incorporeal body outside on the Martian surface, the huge, fifteen-meter red weapon of terror. The Red Tank was armed with mini-nuclear missiles, and a four-meter laser cannon stretching like a long phallus under the salmon sky. I could almost hear the whine of the hover fields as they floated over the Martian rocks, crushing them in brief bursts of electromagnetic instability. I almost got a hard-on looking at its sheer power. Not that it made any difference, though.\nIt made no difference at all.\n\"Two forty six and closing!\" Joey said. \"Wait - I got a lock on them!\"\nThe black tanks on the horizon were suddenly encircled by red. Above them appeared ghostly letters against the Martian sky, the old tag sign, \"UNIDENTIFIED.\" It was time to destroy some Phantoms. \"Charge weapons,\" I commanded, my voice sounding like I was a big shot tank leader rather than some pimple faced kid who'd gotten drafted, \"Steady, steady - fi-\"\nThe black tanks vanished before we fired a shot. \"I lost them!\" Joey said.\nI looked in all directions, the Red Tank's ionic sensors spreading far and wide and supplying the helmet with all available data, but the black tanks were nowhere, nowhere at all. I shrugged. \"Secure from battle stations.\" I took off the helmet, the surface of Mars broke into static and then became the red helmet which I dropped carelessly onto the red command console.\nGeorge stabilized the tank's engines, Joey cleared his tactical display. Then the waiting began again. Silence hung like a drape. Abruptly I couldn't help but think of all our dramatics caused by an enemy that... just disappeared.\nI broke into laughter.\nJoey shot me a glance. Maybe he thought I was crazy. Joey failed to understand that I laugh when I feel really serious, or even better, when I feel like crying. Sweat beaded down my forehead. Been in this tank, I giggled to myself, too damned long.\nThis was supposed to have been fun, damn it. That's what all the Sergeants at Boot Camp had said. \"You don't need a lot of training,\" they said. \"Just think of it like those VR tank simulator games you play at home. After all, war's just like a game.\"\n\"Hey, hey,\" said Joey, as more strangled giggles escaped the hand I had over my mouth, \"C'mon buddy - it's gone now, relax, Frankie.\"\nHis calmness seemed almost neurotic. I muffled my laughter again and looked to the news console. As I flipped through the channels, I chewed the insides of my cheeks, fuming. Relax, Joey said. \"Scientists still desperately trying to determine foe,\" they said. Somehow life just seemed to get funnier and funnier. I looked at the picture of my brother again. In a few years he'd probably be in a tank, just like me.\n\"You relax, Joey,\" I said suddenly. \"You try to relax.\"\nBilly couldn't understand this any more than I did, just like Billy hadn't understood why I had to leave. He was nine years old and perhaps the person I was closest to in the world and he blamed me for getting drafted. \"Billy,\" I had said, standing in the doorway to his room on that day which seemed so long ago, \"Billy, I'm... here to say good-bye...\"\n\"Why do you have to go?\" Tears had been in his eyes. I felt like crying too, but I was supposed to be too old for that crap. \"Why won't you stay and play with me? Huh? All the other kids beat me up because I'm a runt and now you're going away!\"\nHe wouldn't stop sobbing. Billy was like that, he was real delicate, he was always getting colds and he was always getting beat up and it was my job to look after him, my job and no one else's and -\nHe looked up at me. \"What if you never come back?\"\n\"Hey,\" I said, my voice shaky, \"Hey, it's just like a game, Billy. You know? I mean, that's what they all say. They're gonna ditch the whole tank regiment soon anyway, but while those Phantoms keep blowing things up they need us out there to protect the colonies and the domes - I mean, what if the Phantoms are caused by one of the other colonies or aliens, what if they're trying to kill us all...\"\nBut Billy didn't understand all that. \"What if you never come back?\" he kept asking, \"What if you never come back...\"\n\"I'm taking another scan,\" I said, grabbing the VR helmet suddenly. It smelled like rubber and sweat as I pushed it over my head. A flash of static and again I saw the barren surface of Mars. It reminded me of blood.\nI saw nothing, nothing anywhere. I couldn't believe that after almost a year of attacks by these mysterious Phantoms, the scientists still couldn't get a clue what the hell caused them. Month after month the casualties mounted. The Phantoms were almost impossible to fight, too, either they vanished or they tagged you...\nWait, what was that?\nIn the distance, I swore I saw a man on the surface of Mars. He was sitting on a red rock below the darkening sky, and the strangest thing was that he wore no EVM suit, he wore only plain overalls and a checkered shirt, his head was without a helmet and he looked like he was singing, of all things. There, in his hands was... a banjo?\n\"Joey, check for anomalies in the ionics, now okay?\"\n\"Now? You know I check them regularly -\"\n\"Now!\"\n\"Checking.\"\nHe was bald, he had a cream white beard and he was singing and seemed to really enjoy it. I thought I vaguely recognized him, he seemed the slightest bit familiar.\nHe vanished.\n\"Nothing funny with the ionics, Frankie. What the heck's going on?\"\nAgain, I cast the sensors far and wide, and discovered... nothing.\nI removed the helmet slowly. Now I understood. I was losing it. Abruptly I looked around the tank I was in, the console, the screen, the helmet on Joey's head... and as if through the old man's silent song I saw my little world as it really was.\nMy world was red, sterile, and lifeless.\nCould be worse, I guess. Could be dead.\nThe news console flickered, and \"MNN\" began flashing on the screen. I waved up the volume. \"...incident near New China. A Chinese tank commander reports he spotted an unidentified blip on his screen, which within five seconds opened fire on him. The commander fired in response, destroying the target...\"\n\"Good for him!\" said Joey. \"Scratch another Phantom.\"\n\"...which was later identified as American. All three American crew members were killed. The Chinese spokesperson professed there was no known reason why the Americans would open fire...\"\n\"Holy shit,\" Joey said. \"They shot at us!\" I couldn't feel surprised. Tensions from the Phantoms had been rising for a long time now. \"Haven't the Chinese been angry at us?\" Joey asked. \"About America interfering with their mineral rights? Maybe they're the ones responsible for the Phantoms -\"\nI shushed him. \"...American representatives in the Martian Council have demanded that Friendly Fire reprimands be pressed against the Chinese Armored Legion. The Chinese representatives have reportedly become so incensed they have threatened to withdraw their name from the Martian Alliance...\"\nLoud buzzing emanated from Joey's console. \"Incoming message,\" he said.\nI tapped on the intercom. \"You listening, George?\" I heard nothing. He was probably asleep again.\n\"Incoming Orders for Red Tank 9,\" said an artificial and feminine voice, \"From Martian C Sector Command, General Oliver Headly. As follows: 'You are to shift leg seven of your patrol 6 degrees Polar. Monitor any and all Chinese tanks. Be alert for Phantoms; two reported in nearby area. Proceed with caution.\"\n\"Headly's feeling nervous,\" Joey commented.\n\"Ah, screw 'em all,\" I muttered. The taste in my mouth was all wrong. Something was gonna happen, the taste of my mouth, the taste of my own teeth told me something gonna go very, very wrong and soon...\n\"I don't know,\" said George unexpectedly through the intercom. \"Maybe he's just trying to protect us from the Chinese.\"\n\"The Chinese?\" I said with disbelief, groping for some explanation, any explanation, \"They've been here for as long as the Americans and the French! It's not them we need to fear. It's the Coalition on Earth - yeah, it must be them. The nations on Earth don't like the fact that the colonies here are agitating for independence. It has to be the Earthers, they're the ones screwing us over.\"\n\"Just because they're stalling on Martian Independence?\" Joey asked doubtfully.\n\"You bet.\" With a grin I leaned back in my seat and hit him on the shoulder. \"Damn Earthlings -\"\nJoey interrupted. \"I'm picking up a Chinese tank now. It's going along its standard route... seems to be ignoring us.\"\n\"Keep tabs on that tank,\" I said.\n\"We're all fighting the Phantoms, every nationality on Mars is,\" said George. \"We've all had casualties, even the Chinese. It's a common enemy, c'mon, the last thing we need is to start fighting each other.\"\n\"That's why it's gotta be the Earthers,\" I said, \"It's gotta be them -\"\n\"I've got something!\" Joey shouted.\n\"I told you, just keep an eye -\"\n\"Two unidentified bogeys!\"\n\"Two?\"\n\"Phantoms! They're straight ahead of us - they got a lock -\"\n\"Move it George!\" I ordered, grabbing the VR helmet. Suddenly I was above the tank seeing the surface of Mars - small black dots danced on the horizon, but the ionics weren't getting a lock, the circles weren't coming - \"I can't get a fix on 'em - they're jamming - hard right NOW!\"\nThe tank did a fantastic ninety degree a turn - the Martian surface was fractured by an explosion of sand - George shouted a string of jubilant expletives at the near miss - \"That came from the Chinese!\" Joey exclaimed.\n\"Shut up and get me a lock!\" I commanded.\n\"I'm trying, I'm trying - INCOMING MISSILE THREE O'CLOCK -\"\nI spun round and saw it, the huge radioactive nuke boring straight at us \"FIRE!\" I yelled.\nA brilliant neon explosion polarized the air. Man, that nuke would have toasted us except for the Red Tanks' heavy -\n\"That blast just cut off half our armor!\" George yelled.\n\"Radioactive shields holding!\" Joey said, \"- just getting a lock on target B - hold it -\"\nA red circle flashed into being, the massive tank guns began tracking the target. \"- Almost got it -\" George must have been going a good 200 KPH now, man those red rocks and dirt were flying by like a tornado - \"Charge all ordinance,\" I commanded - \"I got it - lock - FIRE!\" The muzzles flashed like a tank in orgasm - \"Say good-bye, motherf-\"\nJoey screamed, \"INCOMING -\"\n\"Lock onto -\"\n\"Too close can't can't -\"\nExplosion fire darkness.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I was not sure how, but suddenly I knew Joey was not causing the sound. With my foot I turned my chair in Joey's direction.\nHe was not there. The tank was empty. \"Joey?\" I called.\nMy voice sounded strange and hollow. I slowly rose from my seat, and looked everywhere inside that cramped interior, wondering where the hell could Joey have gone.\nI touched the intercom. \"George?\"\nNothing.\nThe tapping started again. I focused on it, let it lead me. The control boards were sparking and smoking, and the floor was tilted. Some bulkheads were sagging, but I ducked under them and a moment later I stood below the Red Tank's hatch. I stared up at the hard, unyielding metal, listening while the tap echoed - the metal felt cold and hard as I grasped and twisted the wheel, round and round, and then opened the hatch.\nI climbed up the ladder and stood on the roof of my red weapon of war. Mars stretched like a florid ocean all around me, I felt a dizzying rapport with the salmon sky and the cold, floating dust - and the bloody dirt, which was everywhere. It was all a river of blood. I stumbled down the tank, saw it was smoking. Something had hit it, something big. \"Joey?\" I called again. How was it that I could hear my voice? I looked down at myself. I was naked.\nThen how could I be alive on the surface of Mars? Was this a dream?\n\"Help me!\" someone cried. I looked up, began moving round the tank. \"Help me!\"\nI found him.\nGeorge was lying under a pile of heavy rubble. I could see only his torso; I had a sickening certainty about the rest. He was lying there, crying as I moved round the sharp shreds of rent metal. His blue eyes were all I saw in that red sea. \"Help me, Frankie,\" he kept saying. I was trying to reach him, I kept trying but he was surrounded by all this hard, sharp metal, \"Help me, Frankie, c'mon man, you gotta do this for me. You gotta get me out of here, Frankie. C'mon...\"\n\"Look, you just hang in there, okay? I'm - I'm - gonna get help.\" Right, just freaking right, naked and dreaming and I was going to get him some freaking help...\n\"...man don't you leave me Frankie man don't ya, don't - DON'T ya leave me Frankie don't...\"\n\"I gotta get some help, George. Now you just wait here.\"\n\"Get me my Mom I need my Mom I -\"\n\"Shut up, George!\" I shouted. \"Just shut up! Your Mom ain't here, so just -\" I grabbed my forehead, oh God, what was I saying - \"George - I'm - I'm sorry, just conserve your strength, okay? George?\n\"George?\nSilence\n\"All right, George, c'mon. C'mon, just say something, anything. C'mon, um - please? Please?\"\nQuiet.\n\"You're sleeping, right? You're sleeping again. That's a good idea, Georgie, real good idea...\" I reached for him, cutting my arm on the serrated metal - \"George? George...\"\n\"He's dead, son.\"\nI looked behind me.\nI saw the old man. His banjo was slung over his shoulder. \"Hey,\" I said, slowly, \"I recognize you...\"\n\"Many do,\" he replied amicably.\nHe was tall, thin and wiry and his white beard fluttered in a thin wind. \"Are you a soldier?\" he asked.\n\"What do you think?\"\n\"I think it's too bad.\"\n\"You think it's too bad I'm a soldier? Whaddya talking about?\"\nWith apparent ease he climbed to where I stood and looked at George, his body mauled and torn by the metal. The old man sighed. \"Look at that,\" he said. \"Eaten by his own tank. Hmph.\"\nWithout further ado, the man hoisted his banjo and began to sing. I could not remember the song, but I listened. I listened for a good long time. It was a melody so different from all that hard rock they pumped through the dome music stations, so different from the weapons and the red and the metal. I didn't get it. I couldn't figure what that music was trying to say, I was too used to the rhythm to understand melody, it was something so unlike anything I'd heard but too natural to be alien...\nWhen finally the song ended the man smiled sadly at the body, slung his banjo over his shoulder, and started down the debris. He paused by me, and put his hand on my shoulder.\n\"It wasn't me,\" I said, voice wavering. \"I didn't kill him, it was them, it was... them.\" I couldn't believe I was about to cry - \"I did everything I could, I tried to lead them, but I wasn't good enough, I couldn't save 'em - oh DAMN all those games it's no game is it, it's not a game they lied to me they lied to me -\"\n\"Be careful of what you teach,\" he said. \"Or your weapons will learn from you.\"\nThen he was gone.\n\"'Be careful of what I teach?'\" I repeated. The tapping noise began again, but I could not find it. \"Be careful what I - what is that supposed to mean? Is that supposed to help me?\" I looked round, and then realized I was sinking. \"What the -\" I was sinking into the red Martian blood, or was it rising? Whichever it was, it kept coming, up my legs, up my chest and in my mouth, I started choking and vaguely in the distance I saw a huge sleek Red Tank surging evilly through the dunes under the Martian sky -\nI screamed and woke up. It was too real.\nThey pulled me out alive, somehow.\nThe Chinese had hit my tank once; their shot had been off, thus explaining why I was alive. Usually after a direct hit there was literally nothing left. So I got lucky, and so did Joey, who also survived. George, however, was dead. Like in my dream, they found him buried under an avalanche of metal. He never had a chance.\nThe Chinese claimed we opened fire first, which was crap. And the Chinese said we were firing at them, which was also a load of crap. We were firing on the Phantoms, not on the Chinese, so why the hell had they fired at us? And of course, the Phantoms were nowhere to be found.\nI was subjected to hours of \"debriefing\" which seemed more like interrogation. When they finally had their fill of me, they gave me three days leave.\nSomething about seeing the faces of my family again scared the living crap out of me. So at the tube station I aimlessly loitered about, looking out the massive windows to the other nearby domes, the red of U.S.A. colonies, the blue of the French, the green of the Chinese. I wondered what was going to happen if those damned Phantoms made us all declare war on each other. There can only be so many friendly fire incidents before things turn really ugly.\nI tried to imagine that war, but all I could think up was a computer game. I imagined that all those different colony colors were just like the colors of different computer opponents in the games. But it wouldn't be anything like that, right? It couldn't be like that even though the tanks were run by VR helmets and we saw the targets in virtual reality. It was nothing like that, nothing. Blood was real.\nReaching into my pocket I removed a torn, burnt picture. Billy's silly, nine-year-old grin was still visible after all the smudges and wrinkles. So I got in the damned tram. Five minutes later, I was home.\nThe apartment door looked the same as it always had when I touched the buzzer. It opened almost as soon as my hand dropped. \"Frankie!\" my mother cried.\nEvery soldier's dream, I thought, as my corpulent mother thrust herself into my arms. \"Hi, Mom,\" I said.\n\"Is that Frank?\" I heard my Dad ask.\n\"Yes, yes, it's Frankie, who do you think it is?\" My mother pulled me inside and shut the door, in the process revealing my father. A smile upturned the wrinkles on his face. \"We heard you were coming home,\" he said softly.\n\"Pop.\" I opened my arms and we embraced. \"Where's Billy? Where's Grandma?\"\n\"Grandma'll be home soon, Billy's busy - oh, Frankie!\" In tears, my mother could not resist the urge to hug me again. I suffered through it.\nWhen she was done, \"Would you like a seat, son?\" said my Dad.\n\"Oh. Sure.\" I sat near the coffee table, while my mother hovered. The living room walls had images frozen in place. As Dad settled into a seat across from me he gestured, and the images were replaced by calming scenes of idyllic Earth. I could even smell the scent of pine trees and feel the breezes as they flickered past. \"Like this one?\" my Dad asked. \"It was programmed by a friend of mine at work. I just love the subtlety, huh?\"\n\"Um... yeah,\" I said, remembering the smell of steel. \"It's great.\"\n\"If you don't like it, we can try another one,\" Dad said.\n\"No, I like this one fine.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Fine.\"\nSilence. \"Would anyone like something to drink?\" my Mother asked eagerly.\n\"Certainly!\" Dad exclaimed.\nMother briefly tousled my hair, I caught the warm feeling of motherhood as she passed. My Dad kept smiling, like I had just come home from soccer practice or something. \"So how is it, on the front?\" he asked. \"You know, I've been hearing that the military is planning to render all those Red Tanks obsolete soon. Tanks are relatively simple machines, real easy to use in the Martian environment and all. But they're saying they're gonna replace those tanks with ones run by computer or by remote control, with no humans involved. If they make 'em obsolete, maybe you can come home.\"\nLike there really could be a war with no humans involved. \"Where's Billy?\" I asked.\n\"Billy?\" Dad leaned forward. He seemed hesitant. \"Well...\"\nMy throat constricted. \"Is-s he okay?\" I asked loudly. \"Nothing -\"\n\"No, no, it's nothing like that,\" Dad said. \"You and he were really close, and, and - I think your leaving has taken its toll on him. He's... been sicker lately, I keep taking him to the Doctor. They say we should get him away from that damned virtual reality chamber we got set up in your room, he's been playing too many damned war games lately. Your mother wants me to just shut the whole chamber down, but I think... he keeps playing tank games, Frank. He really likes that Red Tank simulator we got him a while back, but... well, he's just not himself.\"\n\"I didn't want to leave,\" I said helplessly. \"I was drafted, I was freaking drafted. Why can't he understand? You think I don't want to sit on my ass and smell pine trees? I mean, they just grabbed me out of home and school -\"\n\"Calm down, son, calm down,\" Dad said. \"Look, any day now they'll figure out what the Phantoms are, and we can get back to building domes and farms -\"\n\"Oh, c'mon, the Phantoms aren't something alien, everyone knows the Earthers are doing it.\"\n\"That's nonsense,\" Dad said impatiently. \"Earth has no reason to do this to us. Just use your head, son -\"\n\"Yeah, sure. We have three different nationalities here, all vying for territory, and you think the Phantoms are some scientific anomaly? Get real - it don't matter, Pop. We humans take our baggage everywhere, including our killing, that's us. 'To boldly kill where no one has killed before -'\"\nMy mother re-entered the living room with a tray. She approached the table with a beaming smile and set the cups down. Then she sat beside me on the couch, and for some reason, burst into tears.\nInstantly my father was beside her, and then they were beside me, and then I started crying, too, to my complete surprise - for the first time in a long time crying like some damned little boy. But I simply couldn't help it, and they both hugged me and I wished so strongly that I had never been drafted, had never been a Martian boy, I wished George was still alive I wish I wished I was wishing - and then all I knew was that I was there, with them, sobbing and sobbing like a soaked sponge...\nMy Dad held us both, his face taunt and expressionless, he didn't cry, he was a man, he held us until the tears stopped. For a brief moment I actually did feel better. It was like the old times again - the old reality. Before things had all changed.\n\"I know!\" my Mother exclaimed, trying to make her voice cheerful while she roughly wiped the tears from her face, \"I'll give you your welcome home present!\"\n\"My welcome what?\"\n\"Your present!\" she squealed. My Dad raised his arm, said, \"Not now dear,\" but she was all enthusiastic, and she ran across the room to a cabinet and brought a small audio CD to me. \"See? I thought you might get tired to listening to all that rock music,\" she said.\n\"It's a compilation of anti-war songs, sung by an old man on old Earth,\" my Dad said. \"We know it might seem sort of ironic to give it to you now, but... we didn't want you to think we'd forgotten you, or what you were fighting for. Because you know, you're really fighting for peace, son.\"\n\"Peace?\" I asked. \"You never mentioned anything about peace before.\"\n\"Well...\" my Dad hesitated, \"We've. . always been at peace, on Mars. Didn't really seem like there was much point telling you about war.\"\n\"Besides, you were always playing all those games,\" Mom said. \"You're lucky - war's always just been some fantasy to you. We never wanted to tell you about the real thing.\"\n\"Gee,\" I said, \"Thanks.\" I put the CD in my pocket.\n\"You have to talk to Billy,\" said Mom. \"All he does is dream that he's with you, now.\"\nSo I rose. They looked at me from their seats as if I were a cherished stranger, some young, clean-cut uniformed Martian boy here on a passing layover. I almost saluted them. Then I left, to find my little brother. I heard them talking in whispered voices as I rapped on his door.\nNo answer.\nI opened the door.\nBilly's room was covered with posters: soldiers, tanks, planes, ships, guns. Propped on his desk was a crisp, smiling picture of me in my brand-new uniform, waving and grinning like some Martian jackass. He was in his VR center, hidden in his helmet.\nI approached his frail body. Bottles of medicine were littered on the night stand, Billy had never been healthy. A plate of uneaten food was on the desk. The VR chamber was an updated model since the last I'd seen it. The motto written on its side was, \"We Create Reality.\"\nI picked up the spare VR helmet strapped beside the control panel. The panel readout said \"Red Tank Troopers Version 1.07.\" Billy's fingers twitched occasionally, and every now and then he said \"Fire,\" or \"Charge All Ordinance,\" just like a little me.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, I put on the helmet.\nA static wave washed away the small room and then I was beside Billy... in a Red Tank.\nHe looked up in the virtual world. \"Frankie!\" he shouted.\n\"Billy!\" We grabbed each other in a bear hug, I squeezed him so hard -\n\"Frankie, stop, you're hurting me!\"\n\"Huh?\" I stepped back. Even in the VR world, he seemed thin and gaunt. \"Jesus, Billy, when's the last time you ate?\"\n\"I can't eat,\" he said, \"I have to fight with you!\"\n\"What?\"\n\"See -\" He waved at the simulated world around us. God, it looked just like the real thing, everything, I couldn't even tell a difference. \"It's supposed to be the most realistic simulator ever,\" he told me proudly. \"Just like yours!\"\nI didn't know why, but my heart was beginning to pound, like a hammer. \"See, we're still together,\" he told me, grabbing my hand, \"C'mon, let's fight!\"\n\"Billy,\" I said, grabbing him as he turned to the console. \"Let's just forget this, huh? I'm here, I'm home, we don't need to fight right now.\"\n\"Don't be silly. I'll order up an engagement.\"\n\"No,\" I said, \"No, let's talk, let's - c'mon let's quit this -\"\n\"Shut up,\" he said.\n\"What? Billy, it's me. You don't talk to me that way -\"\n\"Just fight!\" he shouted at me.\nI grabbed my helmet, wrenched it off my head. I was reaching for his when I saw the readout on the VR chamber's console changing. It was flashing, \"Program Model FRANK Version 2.45 initiating... MERGING...\"\nMerging? The chamber was merging two programs together. I put the helmet back on, looked up and saw -\nMyself.\n\"Hey, Billy,\" said my doppelganger, \"Wanna fight some Phantoms?\"\n\"Yeah!\"\n\"What - Billy...\" I said.\nHe glanced at me, then at my look-a-like. \"Aw damn, another bug!\" The other me faded without so much as a look of surprise, and I heard the quick dialing notes of a modem. Little Sammy, Billy's closest thing to a friend his own age, appeared in the virtual tank's cockpit beside us. \"What now, Billy?\" he asked with a bored tone.\n\"That stupid Frank program of yours is malfunctioning again. Just a moment of ago there were two of them in here!\"\n\"There's only one now.\"\n\"Yeah, but that one won't do what I say.\"\n\"Sammy?\" I said.\n\"Shut up, Frank,\" said Sammy. \"Look, I can't keep coming over here every time there's a bug in that dumb program I designed for you. Why do you care so much about your brother, anyway? Just wait until he comes home. You don't need some dumb VR program that emulates him.\"\n\"I can't play without Frank!\" Billy shouted.\n\"Quiet, both of you!\" I said. \"Look, I'm Frank, the real Frank!\"\n\"Shut up!\" they both said. Sammy said, \"Look, maybe I can fix him over the weekend, but you better give me all the rest of Frankie's baseball cards. You said you found some more in his room.\"\n\"I can't give you anymore!\" Billy wailed.\n\"Ah stop whining, or I'll beat you up again. It's the cards or -\"\n\"SHUT UP!\"\nThey both flinched. \"It's me!\" I shouted. \"It's me, I'm -\" I wrenched off the helmet, then grabbed Billy and wrenched his off too, threw it across the room where it shattered against the wall. He started yelling and shrieking in utter horror as I dragged him from the Chamber to his bed, and held him there, screaming, \"I'm here!\" into his face.\n\"How could you!\" I shouted. \"How could you make a replica of me! How could you! You can't love what's not real, Billy, you can't feel what's not real! You wanna know what war's really like? You want to know where I've been? Here!\" I slapped him, hard, really hard, \"It's blood, Billy, it's not some freaking fantasy, it's not a freaking game. You wanna know where I've been it's pain pain pain -\"\nMy Dad grabbed me away, threw me bodily into the hallway. My mother flew into Billy's room, from where I heard his sobbing become abruptly muffled when she held him to her breast. \"What the hell do you think you're doing!\" my father shouted. \"Why are you telling him what war is? He's just a kid, he doesn't know any different -\"\n\"How's he supposed to know any different when they look just the same!\" I screamed. Billy's forlorn sobbing floated from his room. \"How could you let him try to make a software copy of me?\" I asked my Dad, \"How could you let him?\"\n\"It's just a game,\" my Dad said, his voice shaky, \"It's supposed to be fun. What could be the harm? It's just a game. It's just a war simulator, it's not real, so what does it matter? Look, you can't shout at him like that, Frank... he's not healthy, and besides us you're all he's got.\" I got to my feet and turned away from him, \"Don't you leave!\" he shouted.\nI stopped. My head was pounding, the walls were pounding, and the taste of my teeth was all wrong, something was gonna go wrong, it was all going wrong...\nMy Dad took a step toward me. \"Frank,\" he said, calmly, earnestly. \"I know you've been under a lot of stress. You've... been in a situation I can't even imagine, it must be like you're stuck in some sort of fantasy that's turned real. I know that no one ever explained war to you, I know, but... how can you just leave Billy? How could you treat him like that? You have to talk to him, son, you have to, you can't just run away...\"\nHe put a hand on my shoulder, I let him lead me into that room again. Billy was still in our Mother's arms.\nHe looked at me like I was a ghost.\n\"Billy,\" I said, my voice sounding colder than I meant it too, \"Billy, I'm back.\"\n\"You're not Frankie,\" he said.\n\"What do you mean?\" I heard rage in my tone, Dad's fingers tightened around my shoulder, I forced myself to become calmer. \"What do you mean? It's me.\" I shrugged away my Dad's grip and approached him, and watched him pale as I neared. Slowly, I reached to him, I touched his face, cupped his cheek. \"It's me, Billy, it's me... I'm right here, little Bro...\"\nHe stared right into my eyes, like he was reading my mind. Emotions made the light on his pupils change in subtle ways, like shadows of thoughts I almost understood. \"Frank?\" he said slowly, \"Frank... it's you?\"\nI nodded. \"Yeah.\"\n\"Are you... back?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Are you gonna stay?\"\nSilence.\n\"Are you gonna stay?\" he asked again.\n\"No,\" I said finally. \"It's just a three day leave, I have to go back...\"\n\"Then you aren't Frank.\"\n\"No, Billy, that's not right -\"\n\"You aren't FRANK!\" he screamed at me. He shoved his Mother away even as she tried to comfort him, pushed me away with all his frail force and ran to the VR chamber. He grabbed the remaining helmet from the ground, and holding it, he stared at me, his eyes wild and panicked, and then his eyes and face and being disappeared behind that implacable black visor.\n\"He doesn't understand,\" my Mother sobbed, \"He doesn't understand...\"\nThe hand which had cupped Billy's face was trembling. \"I've lost him,\" I realized.\n\"Charge all ordinance,\" Billy said.\n\"No,\" said my Dad, \"No, I'll turn off the VR chamber, I'll take it away, I should have before, I'll -\"\nI turned and shoved past him, left the room. As I walked quickly through the hallway I heard him calling after me, but I left that too, I left the apartment.\nI left everything.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I hadn't looked at the card until then and that's when everything fell into place. John Johnson. The name didn't mean anything to me, but the title and company did. That and the card itself - good paper, nice print. I'll bet Mr. Johnson moves millions of dollars a day, and that's a slow day.\nThe chauffeur picked me up from the coffee shop near the school. There was a bag in the back with clothes - a uniform - and about my size. He talked during the whole trip, telling me how to serve a drink, where everything was, what I was supposed to say to people, when I wasn't supposed to talk. I changed in the back and he didn't look back at me once. That's class.\nWe got to John Johnson's big house out in the suburbs just as the sun was going down. Through the security gate and past the guards to a door at the back where he let me out. There was an older woman there in a uniform like mine. She welcomed me into what I guess was the kitchen. I guess; it was bigger than any kitchen I've ever seen.\nI makes a lot of sense he was a big business man. I bet he used to do really well until the talents started showing up. He was a good card player and anyone who can play at bluff can play at business. It's my understanding they're basically the same thing.\nThe older woman was giving me instructions the whole time. \"You'll be the only server in the room at the time. Anything you need you can request through the console and we'll send it up via dumb-waiter.\"\nI explained I knew how a console worked. I had been a waitress at the cafe near the school for three months before I realized I could make better money at the casino.\nThe playing room was huge. One table, and five chairs with ash-trays. Big windows with plush velvet curtains, lots of dead things on the walls. Yeah, this guy was in business. You could smell it. I made it to the bar just as Mr. Johnson and his friends walked in.\n\"Ah, Jesse. A scotch and soda, please. And you, Branwell, what will you have?\"\nThe black-haired guy who belonged to that name waved his hand. \"No no. Not me. It affects my game.\"\nYeah, right. It affected his talent. He was one. I let my field down so he could do his first few sweeps. That's the guy Johnson had hired me to block.\nI mixed up the drinks, but I might have made it too strong because Johnson hardly touched it the rest of the night. One guy, and old gray-haired man named Ellis had a whisky on the rocks, which wasn't hard at all, but Grosset ordered a rusty-nail. I had to ask the console what that was and I still made it wrong. Johnson covered for me nicely though. \"She's new. I gave Maurice the night off. His aunt died this week.\"\nSo, there was Ellis the old, Grosset the rusty-nail, Johnson, Branwell the talent, and a blonde named Simak.\nSimak dealt the first hand.\n\"Ante-up, gentlemen. Ante-up.\"\nAnd I started fielding right there. Johnson picked up from there and wiped the walls with them. Branwell was getting nervous and kept giving me nervous looks. Finally, he quit the game.\n\"I just can't concentrate with all your stuffed heads staring at me.\"\nThey stopped playing and made idle chit-chat about business. After an hour of Grosset's drinking, I learned how to make a rusty-nail right. Ellis the old had to go home to bed at nine-thirty. Grosset and Branwell left soon after.\nSo, it was Simak, Johnson and me.\nSimak put his feet on the playing table and puffed on his cigar.\n\"So, this is her. This is the one you were talking about.\"\nJohnson starting dancing around the room. \"Yes, isn't she wonderful. I don't think anyone knows about her kind yet. Her mother's an empath, her father's a precog, and her brother is kinetic. It's quite a find, you'll admit. I imagine she's not the only one.\"\nSimak was eyeing me up and down. It made me uncomfortable; I felt naked enough as was working without my wig.\n\"You won't be disappointed,\" Johnson chirped. \"I think tonight's little demonstration was enough.\"\n\"I think Branwell and Grosset are just lousy poker players.\" Simak made a weird motion with his hand and the door to the playing room opened. I started fielding just as the little guy entered the room. He looked at Simak, then at me, then asked, \"You needed me, sir?\"\nSimak pointed at me, frustrated. I guessed right, then. Simak had his own talent he was calling in.\nThe little guy stared long and hard at me, breathing heavy. I could feel him trying, but a jack of all trades is a master of none. The guy exhausted himself fighting me.\nSimak ordered him out of the room.\n\"My little brother's better at it than him,\" I said. \"And he's ten. Next time get a body guard who can throw a punch.\" Then I remembered what Johnson had said. \"Or is that your job?\"\nJohnson crossed his arms. \"I used to box. I don't now.\"\n\"How about you just pay me so I can go home.\"\nJohnson started to laugh, but stopped once he noticed Simak wasn't. Simak was chewing on his cigar and brooding.\n\"She's absolutely right. I've been depending too much on talents.\"\nJohnson sat back down at the playing table. \"Then you'll agree to her terms? You could use her more than me at the upcoming conference.\"\nSo, Johnson wasn't offering to sell me, because that's what it had looked like to begin with. He had said 'agree to her terms'.\nSimak was staring long and hard.\n\"Just what are your terms anyway?\"\nJohnson broke in before I could take a breath. \"Residence in her name and a ten year contract at twice what you pay your talents.\"\nSimak chewed his cigar.\n\"Girl, you're shrewd. I like you. You don't have to serve me drinks at the conference; you can be my secretary. The others will accept that. How old are you?\"\n\"I'll be eighteen in three weeks.\"\n\"Would you be willing to sign a contract and do a move-in on your birthday?\"\n\"I could sign a contract now and you can post-date it to my birthday. That's still legally binding.\"\nJohnson nodded. \"She's right.\"\n\"But you can't do a move-in until you're of age; I need you before then.\"\n\"You can pay me cash for this job and I'll do the move in later. Does that work?\"\nThe blonde nodded. \"That works. We can do that. How much is your fee?\"\n\"Ten percent for first time players. Twenty-five for repeat customers, forty on contracts.\"\nSimak looked confused. \"Percent of what?\"\nNow I was stammering. \"Of winnings, of course. What did you think I was talking about?\"\n\"She works at a casino,\" Johnson intervened. \"She protects people from the dealers. That's where I met her. She has no idea what she's worth.\" Then he grinned at me. \"I think we can come up with a reasonable amount for reimbursement, though.\"\nA week before my eighteenth birthday, Mr. Simak and I left for Los Angeles. He had paid for a new wardrobe and got my hair done. I had fought the dye job at first, but red did look pretty good on me. Simak had even gone to the effort of picking the dress I would wear to the conference. Like my old dress, it curved in the right places. I assumed there would be a lot of old, easily distracted guys to deal with.\nThe conference room was the kind you see in movies. I felt a little nervous at first, but Simak guided me to my seat - at his left - and showed me where the bathroom was.\nI left my field down while their talent did a sweep. The whole time I doodled in my note-book what I thought looked like shorthand and thought as loudly as I could, \"I should get my nails done. Am I getting fat? This dress looks wrong on me...\" and other secretary thoughts. Their man was good. He had a good, strong read and he could stay focused.\nThe talent nodded to his superior and the old, head-of-the-company type guy cleared his throat.\n\"Okay, let's get these negotiations out of the way.\"\nAnte-up, gentlemen. Ante-up.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He stood at the first moments of an earth sunrise, senses ablaze in its colorful caresses. He mentally tugged at an approaching cloud cover that threatened his view, hurling it far over the horizon. Silver sparkles flickered through the gusty spring dawn, a touch of fantasy to enhance this sol-earth system's turning-Tauman's offering to this persistent planet.\nFor Earth had cut its yearly solar arc some twelve billion times now. And after so many ages. Tauman felt the fading warmth of home, the illuminated face of an ancient Terra growing cold in the light of a reddening sun.\nShe's late he thought. How can so few moments seem so endless? Could she have finally attempted to cross the void between galaxies? Tauman brushed the fear from his mind. Pausing there in the disc of the rising sun, he focused on a rather intricate problem in stellar physics.\nIt was a matter of delicate timing that would bring joy to his tardy lover.\nSuddenly a swirl of sparkling butterflies darted down at him at incredible speed. The swarm turned upwards, slowed gracefully. From the swarm a shimmering form slowly condensed before him. a smiling silver goddess stepping lightly onto the earth.\n\"You're late,\" he said a microsecond before her eyes met his, melting away the frozen loneliness of so much time and distance.\n\"I was deflected from my calculated temporal coordinate by the aberrant gravitational flux of this star. Why did you pick such a -\", she stopped speaking abruptly, her eyes bright with understanding. She whispered into the mind of her lover.\nIt's the surprise for this meeting... and a reason among the countless that I love you.\nHis thoughts answered.\nEmbrace me, Thera. There are novas to be felt. Sol will soon envelope and vaporize this earth humankind has deserted.\nMoments passed for Tauman and Thera, their gentle touching erasing the years of separation. Their moments passed, our lifetimes. As their bodies touched and their minds merged, they loved as children.\nThey became aware adults in the bodies of children, frolicking fleshy nine-year olds. In huge leaps they bounded through the tall grasses of the hillside, pausing in a sloping meadow to embrace, to touch, to surrender to each other.\nA giggling wheel of merged body and mind they rolled over and over across the dew crowned grasses. A swath of flowers unfurled from the flattened grasses in their zigzagging pathway through this special morning.\nAt the edge of a lake, they waded and skipped stones. Tauman skipped one six thousand times, so naturally Thera skipped hers six thousand and one. The water sprayed their laughter, rippled smiles. The lake splashed cool on their bodies, and the joy of their union enveloped them like a warm blanket.\nWhen the now adult humanoid pair awoke in each other's arms on the mossy bank, an adult Tauman asked, \"Have you ventured far outside the galaxy? You were considering such a trek through the void when we last met.\"\n\"How nice to hear voices, sounds everywhere in an atmosphere.\" said Thera, her eyes distant, her voice from far away, \"Yes Tauman, I've made a start. For a long time I swam among the fringe stars of the outer arm, staring out into that deep nothingness. It's one of my few fears, that chasm between the islands of stars. My dives into its depths have been brief, but my strength is growing as I understand the reasons for my fear.\"\n\"It's not fear from lack of ability, Thera, that I all too readily know. Your translocator powers surpass mine, your control excellent. But please do not confuse my understanding with approval. I fear for your safety. A personal space-time translocation of intergalactic distance has never been attempted.\"\nThera paused, then spoke. \"My fear is of myself, for my thoughts are all that light the way through such distant emptiness. One feels alone there, a loneliness in an abyss far darker than the interstellar night. I need the strength of knowing that I am enough, that I can exist and learn though swallowed by empty intergalactic space. And one day I shall appear in the fields of yet unseen stars, bask in their alien radiations, and sense the energy flow of new galaxies as well as I know the spiraling disc of our own Milky Way.\"\nTauman felt the strength of her dream in her words. \"Perhaps with your help I could journey with you, There are things yet undreamed to learn about the creation of mass-energy, the life cycles of stars.\nOnce my research took me to the new stars of a globular cluster. One highly erratic young star's gravitational field attracted my instrument's attention. I left the ship and personally translocated into the star. Just as I reached its center, the star suddenly collapsed. Its outer atmosphere condensed toward me at incredible speed. I had never encountered such disruptive forces in a young star before, so it caught me off guard...\"\nThera pinched him playfully. \"There, caught you off guard again!\"\n\"Not the first time\", admitted Tauman. \"Well back in the contracting energy sphere, I saw that a stellar explosion was imminent, and was just about to translocate when the core exploded.\"\nGravity clouded Thera's attentive eyes.\n\"The premier blast wave didn't penetrate my personal shields but my individual atoms were dispersed throughout the sector for over a century. I was finally able to reintegrate my physical structure on the planet of a nearby star. Fortunately these clusters are crowded with forming suns, blazing protostars kicking off a lot of free energy. Otherwise I would have had to settle for a nonphysical existence, and the sorrow of never touching you again.\"\nThera nestled warmly in Tauman's arms, eyes wet with love. They held each other tightly, an embrace of love that had not died in a stellar cataclysm, nor perished at the edges of the intergalactic void.\nAs they stared out into that black sea of nothing, they felt life in each breath; standing there in the disc of the sun, the winds caressing, their minds gently touching.\nWe are they whispered, and they loved as a growing one.\nStill merged their mind flew into a nearby flowering tree. Tauman tugged his essence free of hers and entered the body of a pollen grain. Thera settled into the structure of a female flower, a fertile cavity awaiting love's union.\nTauman of the pollen nucleus sensed Thera's need as she felt his growing approach within her outer tubules. Soon the pollen tube of Tauman's adopted body branched into the nuclear envelope, deep within the flower that was Thera. And a seed was born of their chromosomatic fusion.\nThe one grew. Tauman and Thera's combined essence struggled to push through the soft earth into which their seed had fallen. Their roots soaked up the cool rains, which still washed the ancient face of Earth. Together they raised leafy arms upward, gratefully feeding on Sol's red-orange offering. Time was lost in their growing.\nBeside a mature tree, seven meters tall and heavily burdened with blossoms, two silver humans materialized, smiled, and again embraced.\n\"Time grows short,\" said Tauman staring into the reddening disc of Sol. \"Soon there must be a parting, even as this earth passes into cosmic vapor.\"\n\"Tauman,\" said Thera softly. \"You have offered me company on my journey. But what of your research? Your studies on the creation of mass-energy are needed science.\"\nTauman smiled. \"My intentions are to sacrifice neither myself nor my work. Think of the models I might construct from the vantage point of comparative data. These stars of separate galaxies have evolved differently in their own unique space-time. Totally controlled translocator ability could open up passage at will through such unexplored suns. It could provide insights of magnitude similar to the biological leap man made in planetary exploration. The study of alien ecosystems expanded our definition of life. Can these alien stars do less for astrophysics?\"\nThera smiled a face full of love. \"Then let us go. So passes this green Earth.\"\nSeconds later two silver humans locked arms and began to spin in the very face of erupting Sol. We are they thought as their silver surfaces mirrored fire from a sun gone mad, as their bodies and mind focused the mad energies into a beam of pure force. They touched the weak points in the distorting space around the exploding star. With purpose and grace the pulsating duo pinwheeled through the stressed space and its gyrating radiation fields.\nAs a wave of solar brimstone rushed to extinguish the wheel of life that was Tauman and Thera, they hurled forth their ray of concentrated energy, a beaming ionic scalpel that punched a nanosecond exit into a nexus of decimated space. Riding the wave front of crackling forces, the pair slipped nimbly into that tiny space between moments.\nThe surprise! thought Tauman quickly. Look back!\nThera's mental eyes caught a last glimpse of the space-time now so far behind them.\nThere in the full glory of the exploding sun, energies took shape, and her mind reeled at flaming words the size of stars:","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

All of what had transpired had occurred because I had recognised my own inability to do what I thought was both deserved and necessary. I take the mop and return to the hall.\nIt was my last three months of high school, that all important last series of exams on the horizon, and I was the certified dunce of my year as I had been for the previous eight or so. My father's dire predictions of my future, or rather lack thereof, together with the efforts and cajoling of my teachers, had all seemed to fade into a background noise that sat as a fine mist over my life. I was not unpopular (after all, everybody needs somebody they can feel superior to) and my physical strength meant that I was not overly picked on. No brains, some brawn, that basically summed me up. Not that I cared. Friends, girls, going out, I was not bored and hadn't really missed out in any of those respects. But as that final year and a half had dragged on I noticed that I was being left behind in conversations and had started to miss the point of jokes being told. Invited out less and less, I started to become the social outcast I had never been, and then to top it all off my father's words started to get through to me. Now, coming to my seventeenth birthday, I felt as if my life was over before it had begun. It was only my new found despair that made me do what I did.\nI don't, as a rule, answer personal ads or even read the messages left on the Coles notice board. But that day, late in August, I would have sold my soul to the devil for an edge. In fact, I would have been much better off if I did.\nIt seemed harmless enough. Buried five columns deep in the personal ads of the local rag, it stated quite simply:\n\"Underachiever at school? Want to earn a few dollars and improve? Over seventeen? Educator requires subjects for an experimental treatment. Safety and results assured.\"\nTalk about a red rag to a bull, I couldn't resist. I tore the ad out and, an hour later, presented myself at a large house in a slightly run down suburb on the other side of town. A quick check to make sure my clothes were straight and my fly was done up (I had been caught out once before like that), and I rapped on the door. Shortly it was answered by a man who, from my limited knowledge of such things, appeared to be at least eighty years old.\n\"Yes young man, how may I help you?\" I didn't trust him from the start - he was smiling and looked too much like my granddad.\nI thrust the ad at him. \"I'm here for this, have I got the right place?\"\nHe looked at the ad as if he had never seen it before and, motioning me to follow him, went inside. \"Yes\" he commented as he closed the door behind him and started off down the corridor, \"you certainly have come to the right address. But I must warn you, we don't take just anyone you know, you have to qualify.\"\nMy spirits sank. \"Great\" I moaned, \"more exams. Look, I'm not here because I can do tests, I'm here because I can't.\"\nHe stopped and looked at me, a grin creasing his face. \"I'm sorry\" he started, \"I didn't mean to give you that impression. There are tests but not the ones you are thinking of. You see\" he continued as we made our way into what I presumed was the library, \"we have had a number of people answering that ad, and others quite like it, who were just trying to improve on their already quite adequate skills. We are, however, only interested in those who do not have the mental ability to do well, not in the lazy or the over ambitious.\" He motioned me to sit on the couch opposite him. He offered me a drink and something to eat from a small table beside him which, given my walk across town, I was more than willing to accept. I started to relax a bit as he continued on.\n\"Our research is designed to help those who cannot help themselves and may, in fact, be detrimental to anyone else. We have taken the opinion that as they can, and do, help themselves, it is the others who have the desire but not the ability that we are interested in. Hence the ad. It would be simple enough to find subjects and to carry out our treatment on them, but that would provide only half of what we are really after. We prefer our subjects to show enough desire to actually answer an ad and follow it through, and then we have to make sure that those subjects are, in a manner of speaking, that they are in possession of less than adequate mental facilities.\"\n\"You mean you want thick people who aren't lazy?\"\n\"You could put it that way\" he grinned \"and that is what the ad and the tests I mentioned are for. To make sure that a subject is suitable. Now that you have answered the ad, we have a series of very simple tests that will tell us if you are suitable or not.\" He uncrossed his legs and leant forward with what seemed to be great effort. \"That is, if you're still interested.\"\nOf course I was, did he think I was about to waste a trip across town? \"Yeah, I still am, but the ad also mentioned that ....\"\n\"Ah yes, of course, you want to know if you will be paid.\"\nI smiled rather sheepishly. My mother, god rest her soul, had taught me that it was not polite to mention money but my father had taken an altogether opposite view which had rubbed off on me. Still, I felt twinges now and then, particularly with older people around. \"Well yes, that too\" and I was trying to think quick to cover my embarrassment, \"but I wanted to know how long all this will take.\"\n\"Don't worry about that\" he assured me as he stood, \"even if you don't prove to be suitable we will still pay you for the time taken today to do the tests, and they should only take half an hour or so at most.\"\nIt sounded quite reasonable. \"And if I do pass the tests, then what?\"\n\"Then we will start today. It will take three one hour sessions over the course of a half day or so, and the effects will start showing in about a week. We will need you to see us once a week for a month to check the results, all of which you will be paid for, and at the end of that you will walk away brighter and with a slightly heavier wallet.\"\nI was hooked then and there. Money for nothing, one days work and a few visits? I stood up hurriedly, spilling the last few crumbs of chocolate cake from my jeans onto the polished wooden floor. \"Lets get started then!\"\nThe first bit was easy, just filling out some forms. I had to start by lying, the old guy being adamant I had to be seventeen. Luckily for me I had worked out a false birth date so that I appeared seventeen, and he didn't ask for any identification either. It wasn't that long a form but he was watching and timing me as I went but hey, it was his money not mine. That over he cleared the small desk and placed a yellow plastic box, maybe 30cm on a side, in front of me. On each side it had a rubber hand grip, and the top was angled towards me.\n\"Well now, this is the test proper\" he announced. He made me sit closer to the desk and adjusted my arms and seat until I was looking squarely down on the angled top face of the box, one hand on each grip. \"What you have in front of you is a sophisticated computer, and it is going to take you through a series of problems and exercises. You don't need to write or say anything, all you have to do is try and work out the problems in your head. The machine will know how you are progressing as long as you keep hold of those grips, so whatever you do don't let go. Don't worry if it moves you onto another problem before you have an answer to the first, just take each one as they come. Any questions?\"\n\"Can't say that I have. All I do is think, right?\"\n\"Right. I'll be sitting over there\" he said, pointing back to the couch across the room, \"just monitoring your progress with this\" holding what looked like a blue clipboard without paper on it to me. \"Once the half hour is over this will give me the results and we will see what we will see. Ready to start?\"\nWith a final look at me he touched the middle of the clipboard with his finger. With that, the yellow box in front of me developed a shimmering grey square on it's angled top and my palms began to tingle slightly. I clung on and the grey rapidly faded away and was replaced by a picture of a stream, more like a photo, but in 3 D and with movement. On one side of the stream I could see a dog, a man, a chicken and a cat. On the other, nothing but grass. A soft voice appeared to come out of nowhere and stated:\n\"A man and his animals want to cross the stream. The man needs to carry the animals as they cannot swim, but he can only carry one at a time. If the man leaves the dog and the cat alone, the dog eats the cat. If the man leaves the cat and the chicken alone, the cat eats the chicken. How can the man and his animals cross the stream without any animals being eaten?\"\nAs I tried to think of solutions, the characters on the screen did exactly as I was thinking. Unfortunately for the chicken I was not too good with that one, and the second problem came around quickly. And that's the way it went. Some problems were similar to that one, some were spot the difference or the similarity, some were things I did not recognise. A few were simply patches of colours from which my imagination ran riot, one in particular making even me blush as it transformed itself on the screen. I didn't think I went too well, although it was fun, and after what I thought was a too short period of time I was back drinking coffee on the couch and waiting for the result. He stared at the clipboard for a minute or so, and then looked up at me with a smile.\n\"You tried very hard with that, I'm pleased, it's a good sign. As for the result, well, I'd better give you a bit of an idea how the score is worked out. It's not quite your I.Q. test\" he began, crossing his legs, \"but the computer actually looks at not only your answers but how you tried to reach those answers, the way you think, and the way you understand or don't understand the questions being put. It actually rates how your whole brain system operates, not just one part of it. In the end it gives you a score from zero to 200, a score of 100 being normal for a person of your age, and a score of 75 is just on the lower limits of being normal. If you get 75 or above we can't help you.\"\nI was crestfallen. Obviously I'd gotten more than 75.\n\"I'm sorry I wasted your time\" I said as I stood up, \"I'll go now.\"\nThe old man jumped up as if someone had electrocuted him. \"No, it's not like that\" he cried, placing one hand on my shoulder and gently pushing me back down onto the couch. \"We've waited a long time for someone like you to respond - in fact, we weren't even sure you would be able to read the ad! You see my boy, you only scored 45! You are about as close to being mentally retarded as you can be and still function nearly normally. We want you to start right away.\"\nI smiled. Finally I had won something for being dumb.\nThe rest of the day went fast. We moved into a small room on the first floor, sparsely furnished save for a deeply upholstered chair in one corner and a straight backed wooden chair and roll top desk in the other. For three of the next five hours I sat in that upholstered chair wearing a helmet and glasses and listening to strange voices and watching a parade of colours pass before me. The old guy just sat at the desk with the clipboard, occasionally touching it here or there and murmuring gently to himself. As each session wore on I felt more and more drained until, at the end of the last, I felt as if I had gone twelve rounds with Muhammad Ali.\n\"You've taken to the treatment really well\" he stated confidently as we made our way downstairs, \"even from session to session there has been an improvement, although you would not be aware of it, and I think in a week you will be surprised.\" He held open the door for me and offered me his hand. \"There are two things that still bother me though\" he said.\n\"Oh, what?\"\n\"Well, for a start I know that you are not quite seventeen yet and that you lied on the application form, but we thought that someone who could make that sort of effort to be an experimental subject must be keen.\"\nI looked down at my shoes, slightly ashamed of being caught out.\nHe smiled. \"And you also seem to have neglected to ask me what we would be paying for your time. That's a rather large oversight, don't you think?\"\nIt was my turn to grin. \"I guess that compared to the chance to get smarter the money doesn't seem so important. Not now anyway.\"\n\"But a deal is, after all, a deal\" he commented, pressing a few bills into my left hand. \"We will see you next Saturday here at 4:30 pm\" with which the door closed.\nI started noticing changes after two days. Only in small things, but they were things I usually got wrong anyway. At first it was only my memory. Dad found me on Tuesday night putting the garbage out.\n\"Hey,\" as his hand alighted on my shoulder, \"the garbage night isn't until Wednesday son.\"\n\"But they said on the radio the rosters had changed this week and we were Tuesday.\"\n\"Hmmm\" he mused, \"I'd forgotten about that, good thing you remembered. It's not like you, remembering things.\"\n\"Maybe I've just started to take more notice now\" I offered.\n\"Well, it's about time\" he smiled, \"I'm glad to see it. Try and make it a habit eh?\"\nI couldn't help but make it a habit. I started to remember my chores around the house, and for the first time I could remember Dad wasn't on my back for this or that. I got my Aunt Tilly's birthday right too, and sent her some flowers with part of the money I'd made. I started to feel much better about myself, and mentioned this on my first follow up visit Saturday. The old guy was, as usual, full of smiles.\n\"That's a very good sign you know\" he said across his coffee. Even if I didn't have too I'd come back just for the chocolate cake. \"Shows that your mind is working better, recalling facts, operating properly. You should start seeing your intelligence and problem solving skills improving now.\"\nSchool work started to make sense to me, and instead of sleeping in class I was trying to make sense of what was going on around me. It was no revelation, no sudden influx of knowledge - I had eight years of work to catch up on, and although I was starting to see through the gloom I was still so far behind. I started spending morning and afternoon tea breaks and lunches in the library studying, something that gave old Mrs Lynch the school librarian, the willies. She accosted me the first day at the borrowing desk.\n\"And just what, young man\" she vented at me, \"do you think you are doing here?\"\nI peered out from behind the stack of books I was carrying. \"Just studying a bit, that's all.\"\n\"Hmmff. Your reputation precedes you and this would have to be the first time you have darkened this doorway! I'll be keeping my eyes on you. I don't need troublemakers in here, the first sign from you and you are out, understand?\"\nI nodded. Of course I understood, I had always understood, only now I could remember.\nI kept improving, but as I did I started to realise the enormity of the task before me. With less than two months to go I had to cram all of my school studies into that and face the final exams. And, I now knew, all I would end up being was normal for my age. On my second last visit I fronted the old man with this.\n\"Not quite\" he stated, again looking at me paternally, \"you are showing a great deal of improvement and we feel you will be above average once we are through. In fact, we will give you another test on our last visit to make sure of exactly what progress you have made. But in any event you need to look at how you will be compared to how you were, and I am sure that you will agree with me that compared to what you were a month or so ago you are so much more capable. I am not even sure if you would recognise yourself if you looked back.\"\n\"It's not that I'm ungrateful\" I countered \"but I need to catch up on what I have missed, and quickly. I have only got a month and a half to get the results and if I fail that's the end of me.\"\n\"Surely not. You are able to repeat your final year? Your father would allow it?\"\n\"Yes, but another year! All my friends would have left and I'd be on my own, not to mention how it would look on my results card.\"\n\"Ah, the impetuousness of youth.\" He settled further into his chair. \"One more year may seem like an eternity to you but be assured, your results at the end of it will more than make up for the extra time. You must learn to be patient, as we have been. Nothing is done properly that is done in haste.\" He raised himself to his feet with what seemed to be a great effort and guided me to the door. \"Do not forget to return in a week, and we will see what our efforts have produced.\"\nI returned on time but I came back as a far more troubled young man. What he had said did of course make sense, but that was of little value to me. All I could see was that I would again be left behind and I would be labelled 'slow' or 'dumb', something that I felt offended and wounded by. I knew what a stigma was by now, and I had no desire to have one. I had earned the right to progress now rather than later, and after a decade of being last of all my class mates I most deserved to pass through that final set of exams. As I lay awake on my bed that last Friday night, I devised my plan to make sure I would do so.\nSo on that final Saturday I presented myself to the old man and went through the series of tests with the yellow box. They were different this time, and I found no trouble in working my way through them. Upon completion I was told that, far from the 45 I was four weeks ago, I now was sitting on a score of 110, over average but not brilliant. I feigned delight with this; the old man's was genuine.\n\"Marvellous\" he gushed, \"that is just about as good as we could expect to get. The improvement will assure you of a slightly above normal mental capacity and yet will not draw undue attention to yourself. That, you must realise,\" he explained as we made our way downstairs, \"is of the utmost importance to us.\"\nHe continued as we stood on the porch and he locked the door behind him, \"You must make sure not to show off your new found abilities too much. At best people will think you a charlatan for pretending for so long, or at worst a liar and a cheat, and the last thing we want is that sort of attention coming upon ourselves. Once you have obtained your final results your life should be far better than you had envisioned before.\"\nWe strolled over to where his car was parked. He examined his watch carefully \"Now I must leave you as I have to make arrangements for our departure. We leave tomorrow, never spend too long in any one place.\" He continued on as he closed the car door behind him and put the key in the ignition, \"You would obviously understand that people get suspicious very quickly of an old man seeing so many young boys and girls on a regular basis. May I offer you a lift to town?\"\nI pretended to mull the offer over. \"No thanks, I think the walk does me good, but I appreciate the offer. And thanks again for the treatments.\"\n\"Our pleasure\" he replied as the car moved past me. I waited until it had rounded the corner and then made my move. I turned and ran back to the house until I was standing under the first floor window of the room in question. After taking a few deep breaths I clambered up the adjacent drainpipe until, straddling the pipe and with one hand on the ledge, I jemmied the old window lock with my free hand and pocket knife. It took less than two minutes for the whole thing, and as I stood breathless in the room I noticed the helmet, glasses and clipboard opposite me on the desk. Taking hold of them both, I slipped the helmet on and, keeping the glasses on my knees as I sat in the chair, examined the clipboard. As I had thought, it contained no paper but had the same semi luminous quality that the yellow box had. I examined it closely and, seeing a slight indentation to the left, placed my finger on it. Instantly the centre of the clipboard displayed a list of names, mine being towards the middle. Next to it was a green and red square and a scrolling bar gauged from one to ten. Looking all the world as a computer touch screen I moved the bar from one to ten.\n\"Accelerated programme test subject ten commences in ten seconds\" a lilting voice announced in my head, and I hurriedly put on the glasses and sat back.\nHalf an hour later it was over. Although more intense than I had recalled the previous sessions I felt none the worse, except for mild pangs of guilt at having been forced to deceive the old man. Putting the helmet and clipboard back where I had found them, I exited in the same manner as I had entered and made my way home confident that I was now equipped to get what I deserved. My only question was how quickly I would see the effects, and if that would be quick enough for the exams.\nThat I night I slept fitfully, and the following day seemed to disappear in a faint haze of noise, jumbled and lost to me. That following night the nightmares and sweats started, but the following day boded ill as my memory started to fail me again. I thought this to be just a side effect, a passing phase that would not last, but as the days wore on it became gradually worse. One week after that last visit I had hardly slept, my nights being filled with demons and horrors from my imagination, my days being a mad mix of half forgotten memories, shattering headaches and times where I was at a loss to understand any spoken word. At school I was useless, at home avoided, and it was all I could do on that Friday to drag myself back across town, back to the house where it had all started.\nMaybe it was due to the lack of sleep or perhaps the pain in my head that was now my constant, boisterous companion, that I stood there for what seemed ages staring at the vacant, weed tangled lot without comprehension. When it slowly dawned on me that I was looking at the place where that neat, two storey house had stood only a week ago, and I in it, and that all it held were waist high weeds and tangles of bougainvillea and oleander, my world seemed to tilt off axis. I looked around to make sure I was where I thought I was and, confirming that, ran across the road to the house opposite. Pounding on the door with both fists I was greeted by a sour faced woman with a child in her arms.\n\"Hey, hey, quit the bangin' I'm here\" she shouted opening the door, \"whatya want anyway?\"\n\"The old house across the road\" I panted, \"when did they move it? Where did it go?\"\n\"What house? Are you nuts? Nobody's built on that, dunno if it's even owned.\"\n\"But I was there, last week, with the old man, you must have seen him!\"\n\"I know everyone here, and there ain't no old man, and there sure as hell isn't any old house.\" She was getting agitated and the child started to whine.\n\"But there has to be!\" My chest was tightening and I felt the taste of my own bile in my mouth. \"I was there, I talked with him and we ate cake in his front room and it was there! Dammit\" I shouted at her as I grabbed the door frame for support as my legs threatened to give way, \"it was there!!\"\n\"I've been here twenty bloody years\" she screamed, the child adding to it in a rising credenza, \"and there has never been anything on it. I don't know what sort of shit you're putting in your arm but if you're not gone in ten seconds I'm getting the police!\" with which the door slammed in my face, catching my fingers with it.\nI stumbled across the yard and ran down the street, my head thundering with pain, unable to accept what I had seen. By the time I had reached the bridge that led back to my part of town my despair had deepened as reality sunk in. I had had the chance to be a normal, average person with some small future but my greed and pride had made me reach too far. There was no hope of a cure, for now it seemed all trace of the old man and the house had been wiped from the face of the earth, and I was doomed to revert to my former, if not a worse, state, and permanently.\nI leant heavily on the rail to keep my balance as my head grew worse and my body started to shake uncontrollably. I gazed down at the water below and realised that what I had feared most would now happen, that I would form part of the human refuse that others look down upon. There was no exit, no relief from my pain, none that could give me solace. I clambered onto the rail and, without a backwards glance, cast myself out and down.\nI have been told that it was blind chance that saved my life that day, that the fisherman on the river bank happened to be somewhat proficient in CPR, and that her mobile phone was working. They say I didn't breathe for two and a half minutes, and it was only the constant mouth to mouth that kept my brain alive. All I know is that, a month later, I awoke in a hospital bed.\nSince then I have been the same, mentally, as I was those years ago when I answered the ad. If anything, I read and write far worse than I did, and have greatest trouble remembering even the most mundane things. Worse, as a result of my jump I have lost the use of my left side above the waist and my nightmares, although far less frequent, always end with me drowning. I never did sit the final high school exams either. But I am alive, and I suppose that is a positive point, and my job is (barely) within my abilities. Heck, even I can be a janitor, and I have lists for each day's work.\nBut that month and a half I can never forget. I have tried to find that old man, and have kept a sharp eye on the papers, but have not seen sight nor sound of him. I watch the vacant block for a potential reappearance, and have fruitlessly worn out my welcome at the Council and Titles Office hunting for its owner. Vacant and unowned it seems to have always been, and seems more likely to ever more remain so, but I know for a short while back there it was neither. I have even gone so far as to talk to the folks out at the University, but they deny that any such person or research programme existed. They usually laugh at me when I describe the yellow box, clipboard or helmet, saying I have been watching too much Star Trek or spending too much time at the pub. At times I even doubt what happened, but I am certain otherwise. And of the treatments, today I have nothing.\nWell, not quite. Although I have never been interested in such things, ever since that time I have been spending more and more of my evenings on my back, gazing at the stars, wondering. And with my next weeks pay packet I will finally be able to pick up the telescope I have on lay-by at DJ's. I can't help but feel it's all to do with those past events. I have even heard the voices lately too....","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He was careful to avoid the sea pirates of the nearby, water port-city of Viva Las Vegas.\nHe was all too aware of the consequences of encountering each of these threats. This sailor, the last of his kind, had lived a life on the seas of the Pacific. His life was like an old tattered map, and the experiences of his life had weathered holes into it. Behind him was the spectre of the life he had once lived, and now, existed no more. This made his face, and who he was, unobservable to all of those who encountered him on the atoll ridden shallow seas of fallen California.\nHe was a failed hero who was wanting of a new life to replace the one he had lost. He was a stranger in the land of his ancestors, who had returned posthumously, but also, unknowingly, prodigiously.\nHis name was Anacreon.\nThe Last Sailor's wooden canoe, itself a gift of those Californian headhunters who were friendlier than most, grounded itself on the alkaline shores of the Utah coastline. He had arrived in the Mormon kingdom of Deseret, itself a rogue state of people grounded in religious theocracy and the simpler pleasures and insurances of community. It was a place that was observant to the angels of heaven, and to make good with these forces of heaven which looked over them, the Mormon elders quickly took in the stranger from the sea, and gave him a place to eat and rest.\nIn the Land of Brigham, and the place where the ancient Battle of Salt Lake City had occurred, the Elders of Deseret gave up their god-fearing advice to the Gentile who had come from the sea.\nThey said:\n\"Beware of the Brotherhood of the Dark Knights of Moroni. They have left their mother church of saints, and have become rebel angels, in pursuit of holy war. In their quest, they have turned the ground of this holy kingdom in to graveyards in the name of Ye-sus\"\nThe Last Sailor was gracious for their help, but he did not stay. The next morning he crossed the Wasatch Range, alone again, into what landmarks of America still existed, the Rocky Mountains.\nAs he travelled in the cold mountains, his mind did what all human minds are prone to do: he remembered the memories of his past life, a life lived on the seas of the Pacific.\nHis life, as he romantically recalled it, had really started there, and it had been formed by the pull of tight ropes on his young muscles, as he had hoisted up the sails of the ships that had become the landmarks of legend. He could remember every port of call, their names and the faces of these people, as he had belonged to the greatest fleet of ships on the oceans of the planet.\nThey had been called the 500 Strong, and its travails across the Pacific, and all its islands, had been a story of constant journey, and all the romanticism for adventure that had gone along with it.\nBut he remembered bitterly, cursed was the life of all adventurers and doomed was the sagas of all heroes by the fates of the gods. His life had become one of torment, and the deities of the cold, blue ocean depths had forsaken him.\nHis life, in mid stream even, had been visited by the routine of a setting sun that would never again rise to warm his soul. His youth and innocence had been destroyed by the arrival of invincible predators. They had been the predators of the human origin, the cruellest predators of all. Rationality had come in the wake of these predators, and because the heart of adventure alone could not save his life from its own finale, hubris had caught up with them all that day. The over-expectant romantics of the 500 Strong had been visited by a disaster they themselves had chosen unwittingly in their na\u00efve arrogance.\nDestruction of the 500 Strong, and the Last Great Navy, had sadly been delivered via the nuclear payloads of these invincible predators, and the Last Sailors whole life of adventure on the seas of the Pacific had ended.\nNothing remained of the romantic he had once been, glorying in the lust of being alive. All that remained was the guilt of his arrogance.\nThese thoughts passed, and the Last Sailor arrived in the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains. In old Hispanic Colorado the Last Sailor endured the cold weather and walked on. There was no time to mull over his past life.\nHere, on the skeletal backbone of the North American continent, were the ancient Citadels of Sojourner, where dwelt the centuries and centuries old Tribes of Wo-myn in monasteries complete with the worship and devotion to the feminine deity that they called the Horned Goddess of the Triune.\nIn these stone-carved temples they prayed daily to the sources of the feminine, which they followed with the lunar cycles of the moon - the Earth's original moon, Luna, the Huntress of the Night. In all phases of its lunar cycle, the Tribes of Wo-myn tuned into the same cycles of life - death and regeneration - that were within their holy sepulchres.\nThe Last Sailor watched this all from afar, and guessed that the sight of the Earth's new second moon, Ceres, had inspired these horned Wo-myn to new great lengths of ritual and worship of the powers of Nature. Just as he had felt himself inspired, and ready to change just by the sight of the dual lunar skies overhead his one-time Pacific seas, he knew that there were vast changes at work within the Citadels of Sojourner where these Tribes of Wo-myn prayed day in, day out.\nWith Luna full and bright, and Ceres resplendent and dark, the Last Sailor never could have imagined the new ritual that had been inspired by the sight of the new second moon.\nThe Tribes of Wo-myn were welcoming the return of Lost Love, whether it be a daughter, sister, mother...\nOr a husband...\nThe Last Sailor fell asleep under the dual moon sky, and in sleep he could begin to imagine the strange unknowns that were at work within the Citadels of Sojourner. The magic of these Wo-myn priests was strong, and it was as equally as persuasive. In the beginnings of deep sleep, he had now become part of these priestesses secret ceremony. He was in their mountains, and now in sleep, he was part of the ceremony that danced around him.\nHe could not escape.\nHe was made to peer deep into the fires of his own mental agony, the agony he had tried to put away, and forget. Instead he was projected into this fire, and he saw his tragic drama before him. It was a quick vision, a passing thought, and a symbol of the disaster he likened his past life to be like.\nLike a glyph, his own skull was stamped with the melancholia of his lost friends - his lost love. But this pain was transcended by the nature of the magic upon him, and his own inner psychic eye was forced to project itself out from his own corporeal consciousness, warped as it was. He travelled out of his own body on a line lit by the power of magic, where the distance of traveling was vast, and a brief fade from all realizations.\nThe Last Sailor, this tragic hero, now found himself flying over the flattest of lands, where endless fields of wheat were underneath him. He saw in the distance a chain of mountains born of irregularness and tortured extremes which seemingly ripped open the heavens above them, and spilled precious colors from the belly of the bleeding auroras.\nHe crossed the knife-like mountains, and saw beneath him a great sea, with calm tidal waves. In front of him was a rock island set in the middle of the sea, and on top of the island was a strange looking palace. It seemed out of place, and unable to overcome its awkwardness.\nThe Last Sailor realized that this palace was his destination. His soul sped towards the strange looking island palace, until he had reached it. Once there he next realized that he was not alone, and there was another person in his souls presence. He felt that this presence was another soul, just like him, and it belonged to another person, just as his soul belonged him.\nIt was a young woman, whom he could not see. Bizarrely, not being able to see her did not matter to him. It was her pleading words of worry and despair that had became his only vision. Eerily, they also became his only concern. Her voice, familiar, was fatigued with tears, and the humiliation of straining out to a lover to be held, understood, and not judged.\n\"I don't mind if we all die,\" the sound of her voice was the sound of cracking walls of strife. The Last Sailor heard a great sobbing hiding in the deep communion the young woman speaker had with a meditative hysteria. Where he would have expected to find the approachment of her shy cheek, there were instead, the bright ringing images of what exactly the young woman was talking about.\nShe was talking about her demons.\n\"If you leave me, lover, don't think that you will be able to escape the truths in my heart that I have told only to you only to you. I beg of you, please listen to the despair of my talents to destroy a world, afterall - you've made love to them! At this time of the dark night of my soul, I still need your touch. But more importantly, I need you to listen to the darkness that lies inside my heart. I'm afraid the honeymoon of our love is over. Tonight, I must know...\"\n\"Can you love the ugliness inside of me?!?...\"\nThe force of her exclamation was her very own pain, and the Last Sailor saw her image for the first time. Revealing these secrets of hers was self-induced hemorrhaging. It was like loosing a child, and betraying some need deep inside of her. It was a wail of pain on the winds of the dead. There was no one more alone than she was.\nHer visions of inner demons continued.\n\"There will be a time when the sun can warm my heart no more. I will grow old, and I will be less the regal corpse than anyone else in the world who dies. I will die like everyone else, and all of my beauty will be gone. I've obsessed about it for my whole life.\"\nShe sounded sad and near-death. Gone was all the beauty of her youth.\n\"Don't think you can choose what parts you'll get of me. You'll soon see every twisted root of the portents to carry the banner to the 'the end of the world' afterparty, and - expect to believe that they are born of love.\"\nShe then sounded hysterically unconvinced about everything about herself.\n\"The handwriting is on the wall - and I keep finding myself at the end of our world.\"\nHer voice became meek as she ended her tally of inner demons. She collapsed weakly into her own self-pitying gravities.\nAt this moment, the gales of the dead whipped through planes of the ghostly imprints of time. The Last Sailor called it the Forever. It had not been since the last day of his old Pacific life that he had even felt the slightest of whispers of the breathes time made in-upon himself.\nThe young woman fell into his arms, and he loved her. He knew he loved her the same way a child cannot comprehend what it does that makes its parents smile and laugh. He understood nothing, but went along, nonetheless.\nHis love for her was an intuition.At the moment that the young woman shrieked a painwracking plea for him to love her, over and over again, and the Last Sailor tried to make sense of why he was able to say he did in fact love her as well. It was when he invited rationality into his dream that the vision of the dream began to fade, and he awoke. The cold Colorado night sky returned overhead in the land of the awake, and the non-dreaming. He was back in the Rocky Mountains, where snow capped peaks were the nurseries of the stars in the Via Lactea, one and the same with the potential to procreate.\nIn the meantime, far to the south of Colorado, the spirits of the lands of the living and dead dwelled with a far more ancient people than the Tribes of Wo-myn in the Citadels of Sojourner. This was the frontier of the vanished Anasazi, and the deities of the land now looked after the descendants of Montezuma and Cortes. The children of these high mountains danced a spiral tarantella that called to action the animals of the high deserts to protect their homes in the fold and peaks of this old sunburned landscape. The children of the marriage between Nature and Humanity, in all their darkened forms, had guided the heroes of Mexican myth and antiquity past dangers before, and names like Juarez and Villa were blesswords that people kneeled before in times of need.\nThis was one of those times of need.\nIn the land of the vanished Anasazi dwelt the Seven Golden Cities of Cibola, and in the splendor of their Maurentanian towers lived the defenders of this land and its people, now threatened by a new threat from the east.\nThe Lone Star Empire.\nTexas.\nThe deities of the white deserts and high mountains had guided these protectors of the lands to victory over past tyrants and invaders before, and so they would again. The Seven Golden Cities of Cibola stood tall and strong, and its spires were defiant and defensible against the threat of the Lone Star Empire of Texas to the east.\nThey would not fall.\nIn one of the seven cities, where the vortex of a storm raged overhead its spires, there was a direct line between the events of Nature and Humanity. Here controversy resided, and it had recently blown in from the lone star east.\nThis controversy had a few names.\nThe first name was Treason, and it revolved around the figure of the recent expatriate and dissident artist who had fled away from his native home of Texas. This was no ordinary artist; this was the royal court artist of the Waterloo Monarch - the King of Texas, the head of the Lone Star Empire.\nThe royal court artist of Texas had a title for his position, which was called \"the David.\" His job and responsibilities had been to glorify the Waterloo Monarch of Texas, and further illustrate the propaganda of state-worship as directed by the Hegelian Ultras. This particular \"David\" of Texas had showed talent at an early age, and he had been raised since that time to be the royal court artist, just as his grandfather had been raised, and his relatives before him.\nBut this expatriate did not answer to the name of \"David\" any more, and here was half the reason why he had illegally abandoned the Waterloo capital of Texas, and fled into the western frontier.\nHis name was Shiloh MacKenzie, a young man with talent to burn, who was more rock-n-roller than rococo state worshipper. He had committed treason, and abandoned his royal position, because of drastic regards for the safety of his mind and body. With calculated animal action, he had forced the very Countess of TexArkana at knifepoint to help him escape the political maneuverings of the Hegelian Ultras, as even more and more sacrificial blood had been poured at the feet of the Godstate of Texas.\nEarlier in those dark days of political assassinations, Shiloh had been more brazen and bold, and led underground movements of radical information to be passed along to the unknowing subjects of Texas.\nThe last straw, in the eyes of the censors of the Hegelian Ultras, had been the private portrait that he had done comparing the tricolor of the William Robert kings of Texas to the unpopular image of a Californian president from Classic Americas \"Tinsel Fortress Time\" era.\nAfter the death of the final William Robert king of Texas, the ascension of \"The Destroyer\" as Waterloo monarch, and the murders of his Jacobin friends, Shiloh had watched the downward spiral of Texas long enough. He relinquished his position as \"the David,\" and became a fugitive in the Seven Golden Cities of Cibola.\nHe had trusted himself to the emptiness of fate.\nShiloh could trace the valley of darkness his home of Mexican Tejas had descended in history. It went back to creation of the Von Strauven Imperium, on the heels of the Limited Nuclear Exchange, and the closing of the Great Partition. This had all happened in 2882 c.b.e.\n\"In the year 2882, neo-American prints were in my home too...\"\nShiloh recalled the rise of the Hegelian Ultras circa 2882 c.b.e. They had taken over the once-ceremonial kings of Tejas, really just father figures to the people of Hill Country, and turned them into the dynastic line of the autocratic William Robert Kings. These kings had become the absolutist heads of a Bonapartist-style religion of bureaucrats, royally designed in the gardens of Austin, to rule the Waterloo court as emperors of empire.\nThe State of Texas, no longer called Mexican \"Tejas\", was seen as the throne that God sat down upon. The State became a symbol of worship. State worship began in Texas. It was a lusty affair of sacrifice, as people were seduced into prostrating past the altars of Texas in parades of pain. The Lone Star was the symbol of the greatness inside the Texas masses, and Hegelian propaganda hammered the ideas of a \"spirit of the people\" into their dreams.\nPride bred vanity. A \"great people\" fell. Military adventurism resulted, and expansion was the justification if it meant the spread of a \"great people\". An empire resulted, with the Lone Star as its crown. The \"near abroad\" was the arrogant terms the 300 Original Families called the sovereign nations adjacent to Texas, and they were ruthlessly conquered and added to an empire. The Hegelian national propaganda slogan was, \"Who Better to Rebuild a Chevy than a Rock-and-Roller! Who Better to Rebuild America than a Texan!\" and the Southrons of the Old South were manipulated into political marriages with Princes of the Texas Rangers. The people of the splintered lands of the Americas were led into a fateful mission to rebuild a one-and-true, united \"America\" with all the national prestige that had gone along with the Classical predecessor.\nPax Americana.\nAll of this had created the nightmare of American Revivalism, a gross distortion of history. It was blind nostalgia, surrounded in inaccuracies, stereotypical associations, and the dreaded 'G' word.\nGolden Age America.\n\"If I see another neo-American print, I swear to the heavens, I will take a shit...\"\nShiloh had not wanted to stay around Texas to see it rebuild its own misconstrued version of Classic America.\nHe'd seen it on TV.\nShiloh wisely knew he could not stay in the seven cities very long. For starters, taken in consideration of the Texan assassins who would one day find him, there was another reason why Shiloh did not want to stay in his present location.\nHe had not meant this to be his final stop.\nShiloh's goal was to reach the Sea of Kansas, and enter the Palace of Kir-sten'ya, the home of the Earth's empress. He was merely answering her call to create a new human renaissance, and come to her home in the artificial inland sea that had once been the land of Kansas. This was in celebration of the new moon of the planet; Ceres, the Season-Bringer, the sign of a new epoch.\nShiloh MacKenzie knew that if he was going to violate Incorporated Law, and jump from the frying pan into the fire, he needed the best ride imaginable to the Sea of Kansas, and the Palace of Kir-sten'ya.\nHe needed a Neo-Cola Classicist.\nThey were the racecar Cossacks on the ancient American highways of lore. Unbridled, these masters of the roads knew no masters but the throbs of their octane hearts, and the racing overdrives of their Firebird engines across the feudal landscapes of America.\nThey had been the one-time cavalries of the famed Von Strauven emperors. History recorded, that the Neo-Cola Classicists had been instrumental in the decisive battle for control of the world-state at Elvis Downs. History also recorded that the Neo-Cola Classicists, fresh from the heat of that same battle, had split off from the ranks of the Von Strauven army at the moment of victory and gone after greater plunder in the autowreck parks of their 'mecca': Detroit Rock City.\nSuch was their legend, recorded for all time in history.\nSince then, the Neo-Cola Classicist's lived in their powerful clans, scattered across the sacred spaces, that were now the haunted relics of America at its most urbane height. The ghostly-air screamed with the metal battle cries of their Firebird war engines, and the air boomed with the sonic assaults of heavy metal thunder, hell bent for leather.\nThe gods of rock-n-roll looked down lovingly upon their children, and beneath their cold armor and chainmail, there beat the real heartbeats of America.\nShiloh had known that the seven cities were a hot car room for the Neo-Cola Classicists ever since the destruction of their home city of Cahokia. Through the ranks and connections he was able to obtain in the seven cities, Shiloh was introduced to a young Neo-Cola Classicist warrior, a girl named Hessia. She was a princess of princesses to her clans-people, whom the sun seemed to shine on for all time with a special duty to show the beauty inside, and outside of her. For the very forces of heaven and hell seemed to be at peace within the radiance of her beauty.\nThis was the nature of her creation, as close to divine that mortality could permit.\nShe was brash, and the first words from her mouth were the specs of her rebuilt Firebird.\n\"4.0 Kings-Liter\/ Ethanium-petrol V-8\/ 350 Phaetons\/ It's the fastest war-chariot in west Tejas State.\"\nShe was also a glass half-filled, and she was eager to go to the Sea of Kansas and the Palace of Kir-sten'ya, though her reasons for taking the risk of violating Incorporated Law she kept secret. She only said this:\n\"Maybe I want to talk to a little black dog named \"Toto.\" Who knows?\"\nMaybe, but either way, she had agreed to take Shiloh, former court artist for the Lone Star Empire, and now a fugitive, to his destination in the Sea of Kansas. Once there, he was on his own.\nShiloh tried to make light of the risks they were taking when they were strapped inside her war chariot, ready to depart for the Sea of Kansas.\n\"Well here we go, hell bent for leather...\" he said, \"The road is a spine, and humanity, a cold shiver\"\nHessia flashed him the grin of a killer.\n\"This is no time to let the good times roll,\" she warned, \"Let us make way for the sights to come that will save our souls.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

It was cool in the air-conditioned building. Almost cold, while outside the July sun poured its merciless radiation down into the stone, concrete and glass canyons of the Texas city. But this man with glittery grey eyes, grey eyes that darted about nervously, was sweating even in here. This is my last chance, he thought.\nMartin Jobberts was this man's name, and he pulled on the clear plastic handle of a glass door before him. The metal rim on the bottom of the door scraped the tight, nylon shag of the blue carpet with a staticky rasp. The fingers of his left hand tightened convulsively on the sweaty handle of his briefcase, and he felt hot and uncomfortable in his old, wrinkled suit.\n\"Marty!\"\nA paunchy, red-faced man with thinning white hair slid out from behind a substantial oak desk. Martin smiled into the familiar face of Sid Aibell. Sid had lost some more hair since the last time he'd seen him, but the man's sapphire-blue eyes were shining with a genuine light. He had his white shirt crumpled up to his elbows, and his tie flopped loosely.\n\"Hi, Sid,\" Marty replied, holding out his right hand. The two men locked hands for a firm handshake.\n\"How're you doing, you old sonuvagun!\" Sid exclaimed, giving Martin's hand a final, sharp squeeze. \"What've you been up to lately? I kind of lost track of you after that Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence program was cut.\"\n\"Been keeping myself busy,\" Martin replied, blinking quickly several times as he involuntarily glanced at the floor.\nSid either noticed the subtle sign, or was simply following his regular greeting behaviour, because he immediately gestured with a hairy arm to a black leather chair that waited before his desk.\n\"Have a seat, Marty,\" he said invitingly. \"Bring me up to date.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Martin mumbled, heading for the elegant seat. Sid maneuvered himself and his paunch back behind his big desk. Airy, cow-like sighs emanated from the leather chairs as both men settled into them. Sid presented to Martin a mildly concerned and non-threatening countenance.\n\"How's the wife?\" Sid asked.\n\"Fine,\" Martin responded automatically, about to brush the question aside. He caught himself, and added, \"Vera's okay. I guess she misses the kids a bit, though.\"\n\"They've all flown the nest, huh?\"\n\"Jason, our youngest, left last August for Cal State Long Beach.\"\nSid nodded as if he expected more words to come on the subject, but Martin just looked down at the briefcase he had set by his feet. Sid's smile faltered. He glanced upward, searching his memory for something to say.\nBefore the silence grew uncomfortable, Martin looked at Sid again. His eyes were unguardedly vulnerable.\n\"It's about SETI that I've come, Sid.\"\nSid shifted his weight. He leaned forward and intensified his open, 'you can talk to me' manner.\n\"Haven't found any new work since the cuts, huh?\" he guessed gently.\n\"I haven't even looked, Sid. I want - hell, I NEED - my old job back.\"\nSid grimaced as if he tasted something sour. He sighed, his eyebrows going up innocently. \"I'm not that big a fish at NASA, Marty, you know that. There's not much I can do about it. Those cuts came straight from Congress.\"\nMartin nodded, his eyes blinking. \"I know. I've talked to everybody else, but it's no-go.\"\n\"Armstrong wasn't sympathetic?\" Sid wondered with mild surprise. \"That project was one of his babies.\"\n\"He's distancing himself from it,\" Martin said accusingly. \"Suddenly everybody seems to think that it was a total waste of time and effort.\"\n\"That's not what they said ten years ago, is it?\" Sid ventured compassionately.\n\"No, Martin glowered, \"but that's not the worst of it.\"\n\"No?\" Curiousity made the pitch of Sid's voice rise as he nibbled the bait. \"What is?\"\n\"I've been doing research independently - at home,\" Martin began, his tense shoulders dropping a bit and his back straightening a little. \"I've got one of those XP-38 antenna dishes - you remember those, don't you?\"\n\"Sure,\" Sid replied, taking the cue. \"It was one of the few saleable spin-offs to come from SETI. It paid SETI's way for a couple of years. Sure, I remember it.\"\n\"Well, I've got it hooked up to a working prototype of that multi-band wave separator I was working on just before the cuts,\" Martin said, his eyes sparkling with excitement now, and sweat beginning to glisten on his forehead beneath his limp black hair. \"Every night I scan a different sector of sky. It's not the greatest operating procedure - a little hit and miss, I know - but for the small scale I'm working on it's alright.\"\nSid leaned back and glanced at the digital clock that faced him. \"Get anything besides the usual static?\"\n\"Yes!\" Martin hissed triumphantly. \"Almost every night - no matter what sector of sky I'm working on! Every night, Sid! Every night I get a transmission! Sometimes a few minutes, sometimes for as long as hours! Slightly different patterns, but always similar Sid!\"\n\"You sure you're not picking up some TV or radio signal?\" Sid said skeptically.\n\"I've taken all my tapes in to the sound technos in Huntsville - they still owe me a few favours - and they tell me that the patterns don't match anything on file.\"\n\"What do they think it is?\"\nMartin's hot face darkened. \"They think it might be some interference from some kind of machinery in my house,\" he said dismissively. \"But they admit, Sid, they admit that it would be some of the most irregular, weird machinery ever.\" He gripped the edge of Sid's desk with one hand. \"And I don't even have a microwave, Sid. Most of the time I can't afford to turn the AC on!\"\nSid's head bobbed slightly, as if he were trying to decide something.\nSuddenly an electronic ring issued from Sid's phone. He picked up before it rang again.\nMartin's body sagged, his back bending, feeling the momentum he'd built with Sid vanish more with very twitch of Sid's face as he became totally engaged with whoever was on the other end.\n\"Shit,\" Sid swore, \"I totally forgot. Yeah. No, I'll be there. T-40 files? I'll see if Madeleine's got them ready. Yeah. Sure. Don't worry. Yeah, bye.\"\n\"What I was wondering was -\" Martin piped hopefully as soon as the phone clattered in the cradle.\nBut Sid held up a finger and snapped, \"Wait.\" His face was rigid with harried concentration, as if he were trying to concentrate on a very faint melody. \"Sorry. I've got to talk to my associate.\" He picked up the phone again, and pressed a few buttons. He stared down at his desk.\nMartin heard a faint elfin voice come from the receiver.\n\"Hi, Madeleine,\" Sid replied. \"Are you finished with the T-40s?\" Sid listened intently. \"Great. I'll pick them up on my way to see Armstrong.\"\nSid sprang up from his chair and bustled to the coat rack by the glass door. \"Sorry to rush out like this Marty, but that was Armstrong. We have a budget meeting at ten, I totally forgot.\"\n\"I have tapes,\" Martin pleaded, throwing words like hooks at Sid. \"I want you to listen to what I've got.\" Martin got up from his chair and followed Sid. \"This is what SETI was looking for all those years! I've got proof that we're not alone, Sid! I swear, these transmissions prove that there's other intelligent life in the galaxy besides us!\"\nSid grimaced at the burning desperation in Martin's eyes. He twisted away from Martin as he pulled his ash-grey jacket on. \"Why don't you leave one of those tapes here, Marty? I'll get to it as soon as I can and I'll give you a call. Maybe we can do lunch.\"\nMartin stared at him, his fingers squeezing the handle of his briefcase so that the knuckles of his pink hands went white.\nSid brushed past him and opened the door. \"Take your time leaving,\" he said, smiling, \"but I've got to run. Oh, and give my love to Vera and the kids.\"\nAnd then the glass door rasped closed over the blue nylon carpet, and Martin watched Sid's body, shimmering and distorted by the glass, recede down the hallway.\nMartin slammed the door to his blue '86 Toyota Corolla and walked up a narrow path of crumbling brown bricks. Spiky Kentucky blue grass threatened to overwhelm the walkway on either side. Martin didn't see the wild lawn, and he blindly inserted his key into the lock on the white door of his house. He heard a click and then pushed on the scratched golden handle.\nHe stepped onto a grey mat and closed the door behind him. He was welcomed by the rousing music of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He bent to slip his shoes off.\nHe walked along a thick orange shag carpet, pausing and petting a black dog that came up to him. The dog's tail wagged happily.\n\"Good boy, Beau,\" Martin muttered to the black Lab without enthusiasm.\nHe straightened up, seeing where his wife lay in baggy white track pants and a pink sweater on the dirty living room couch. Her dull grey eyes were on him. She glanced quickly at the TV and then back to him.\n\"Hi, honey,\" Martin sighed, continuing on down the hall.\n\"How was your day?\" she called after him.\n\"Fine,\" he said over his shoulder. He trotted down the carpeted basement stairs, the dog at his heels. He flicked a switch on the wall as he passed, revealing gyprock walls, a stained grey carpet, and a cheap desk cluttered with computer hardware shrouded by plastic dust covers.\nMartin sat down at the desk and pulled the plastic from the monitor, printer, keyboard, hard drive, and the box that housed the controls for the XP-38 antenna dish on his roof. He dropped each plastic cover to the floor, creating a pile of stiff, yellowing, semi-transparent stuff beside a machine that was raw with wires and exposed circuit boards. It looked like some high school whiz kid's science project. A colourful sheaf of wires exited the home-made machine and snaked past Marty's leg to connect in the back of the computer on the desk above.\nIt was this machine that had winnowed out and recorded the cosmic sound patterns that Martin had so often heard.\nMartin pressed the power button on the hard drive, and the computer responded by emitting an electronic burp followed by what sounded like the cracking of chicken bones. This crackling sound gave way to a whine, and before it had become a breathy, electric hum, Martin's fingers already played over the keys.\nSid had been the last chance. There was nobody else to go to now. Martin gnawed his lip. He keyed in commands that angled the dish and activated the multi-band wave separator.\nStatic crackled from the computer's cheap speakers. And then he heard it again. Within the random static, a pattern. Unmusical, unsymmetrical...yet every so often some crackling motif or theme repeated. Martin listened, spellbound. He quivered with excitement, and wished he could share this with someone. But no one cared. No one believed. He tensed suddenly, and the thought flashed through his mind that he should run his filtering programs again. He had compiled hundreds of thousands of frequency patterns - everything from machinery to weather - and he had checked them against the patterns he picked up on his computer. Not a single match, ever. So why bother doing it again? Nobody cared, and he certainly didn't need to convince himself anymore.\nHe wasn't crazy...everybody else was. The planet was blanketed with these signals from intelligent forms of life! They were surrounded by non-human intelligence and nobody noticed! Nobody! He shook his head, dismayed, delighted, defeated.\nBeau was stretched out behind Martin's battered old swivel chair. He slept, and twitched in the throes of his dreams.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Hessia's Firebird foamed and snorted as it left behind the mountains of the Taos frontier in a cloud of dust, and before they both knew it, they were in the Lone Star Duchy of Oklahoma. Cautious minds would have left behind this Texan imperial possession all together, but it was well known to Hessia that the Cherokee Nation had a millennium of hatred for their Texas overlords, and who better to find safety with than the very people Texas had repeatedly brought misery to.\nOn this red morning, burned by the Sun of old, the two highway travelers on board an antiquated Firebird, made their way into the Oklahoma land where armed camps of enemies faced off against each other. These enemies were the Indian Nations, resurrected a thousand years ago at the start of Americas 'Commonrealm Period'. Their enemies, recently on the upswing, were the Suburban Fortresses built only recently during the spread of American Revivalism.\nShiloh and Hessia were just two more examples of all the opposites and dualities that had always made up America.\nA look inside their minds said that much:\nShiloh looked at Hessia and saw what everyone else saw; one of the most beautiful women in the whole world, and a face to set a thousand engines to wail. He told himself he would try to paint a picture of her in the nude once they had arrived in the Palace of Kir-sten'ya. He would do this portrait just as all the great masters had done before, and he laughed inwardly at the childhood fable that anyone who saw a Neo-Cola Classicist in the nude was torn to bits by the hounds of hell.\nHessia looked at Shiloh and saw what everyone saw in the nobility of Texas; aristocrats with powdered, pink wigs having sex in the royal gardens of the Waterloo capital. No matter his reasons for leaving behind the frolicking decadence of his royal upbringing, and no matter his good intentions to join the 'the Eternal Renaissance' in the Palace of Kir-sten'ya, he was still accountable for the Lone Star Empires destruction of her homecity on the banks of the Mississippi river, legendary Cahokia, the last symbol of the Earth's thousand year golden age.\nThey both were gone now, everything golden, that had once been touched by the Sun.\nBack to the cold North, away from the long hot days of the endless sunsets in Oklahoma...\nThe Last Sailor had been walking for days, as if on a mission to not rest until he could light his torch in the company of one honest person. He had continued the exploration of the land of his ancestors into the northern grasslands of a place that for centuries had been known as Wyoming, but now politically belonged to the Fellowship Lands- lands allotted to the Von Strauven Imperium by the nations of Northern America.\nToday, the Last Sailor smelled an all-together, to- familiar smell in the air.\nBurning human flesh.\nHe had once smelled enough of it in his past to make someone want to die.\nThis was all the convincing he needed to explore the origin of the smell.\nHeroes are also wise fools.\nHe crawled over a small hill, where the scent of burning flesh was a thick ripple of burning nausea. Overcome with sickness, he peered into the oblivion.\nBefore him, in the nearby valley, was a smashed and over turned semi-circle of stone cairns and megaliths that looked they had once been an astronomical observatory for pagan rituals, but had recently been turned over in desecration.\nHe soon saw who had done this. The reason was in a smog of burning flesh. It was human pollution. It was a camp ringed in laser wire and fences made of steel razors. There were emaciated men, women and children imprisoned here. They were being worked to death. They were slaves and that was the plan. This was a concentration camp, and these people had been brought here to die.\nBodies stank of death. Where humanity had once dwelt there was a hole. In that hole, a skull, named atrocity.\nBefore the Last Sailor could take another breath laced with holocaust, he heard the distinctive electric whirl of a plasma rifle pointed at him from behind. He slowly turned around.\nThe brandisher of the weapon was a hooded person, who upon closer inspection was a young woman. She looked strong and dark. Her tribal dress of uniform was unique, almost military style. She had an 'insignal patch' on the right arm of her parka, and under her hood was a soldiers cap with another pagan 'insignal patch'on it.\nThe Last Sailor had a good idea what he was dealing with here. He responded appropriately, and spoke to her.\n\"Long-Live-The-Many-Faces-Of-God\"\nThe Last Sailor knew she was an Engineer, a rare pagan soldierhood, who themselves were descended from an even older warrior order that had helped build the legendary Commonrealm a thousand years ago.\nThe woman soldier put down her plasma rifle, but still looked stern.\n\"You'd be wise to get out of here,\" she warned. The tone of her voice had the easy lilt of the simple countryside. \"We're busy evacuating all of our pagani people away from here. These Christian soldiers...\" and the Engineer spit with hatred and disgust, \"...These Christian devils are too overpowering here.\"\nThe Last Sailor asked a question.\n\"Where am I?\"\nThe young woman pagan soldier replied.\n\"This is the land my people once lived on. It used to be called 'SahV-HehW Adrien,' but those damned Von Strauven bastards and their thievery took these lands, and called them the Fellowship Lands - And those murders with the deathcamp claim this as the crusader-state of Edessa, validated by Incorporated Law as a Christian nation clean of pagans- My people!\"\nThe Last Sailor had had enough of the smell of burning flesh.\n\"So who is running those deathcamps?\"\nThe Engineer answered.\n\"Damned Teutonic Knights,\" she spit again, \"My name is Janus, and you're my guest,\" she smiled a country grin, \"Why don't you come with me?\"\nThe Last Sailor shook her hand, and agreed, happy to leave this place. They both left together, unknowing of the wounds they both shared.\nThe two strangers to one another left the valley of death that day in an ancient Brazilian-made Sergio automobile that stank of putrid hempoline. The Engineer, Janus as she had introduced herself, told the Last Sailor that the engine of this car had been around since the Recognition Wars. The Last Sailor doubted that, afterall, the Recognition Wars had happened a thousand years ago, on the eve of the breakup of the decrepit 'United States of America'. But knowing these pagan Engineers, and their long history, it was not improbable that Janus was correct.\n\"My roots go way back to the Baalist exiles to Antarctica...\" she explained about herself, \"My last name is 'Southcross,' named after the southern pole star constellation. That's how I know.\"\nThey drove north that day. Janus the Engineer explained that they were heading towards a place called Montana, part of a greater land called Taiga. She explained the places they drove through enroute, principally the atomic wasteland of southern Montana that had been destroyed by the nuclear missiles of the former emperor of the Earth, Maximillian, during the Crisis.\nJanus explained the significance of this place, and what it meant to her.\n\"This was once the land of my pagani ancestors. They were destroyed by their own vanity. This has always been the pitfall of my people.\"\nAfter hours of driving through fertile farmland full of the superstitious people of the American countryside, they arrived at their destination.\nThe Last Sailor was amazed at what he saw. Built into the mountains was a giant assemblage of stone houses and temples. It was a primitive metropolis, made up of villages collected around each other into a large mountain community. Janus explained to him that the model of this settlement was based on High Commonrealm Era architecture, built by her ancestors a thousand years ago. She then went onto explain to the Last Sailor about the rulers of the mountain settlement.\n\"It's called Communitaria, protected by the dual armies of the Red and Black Banner. The Taigan philosopher-kings permit this agrarian nation to exist in their kingdom.\"\nAs the two of them walked around through villages of the mini-city, the Last Sailor witnessed the life behind these High Commonrealm Era walls.\nIt was a refuge for the sick and old who needed assistance. It was a place of schooling for the young. And it was a place of religious tolerance and cultural diversity. All around that the Last Sailor could see, it was a strange, eclectic community of diverse people. They lived here in hope for greater human prosperity in an age when uncertainty gripped the planet.\nJanus told the Last Sailor that the soul of Communitaria was embodied in an old man named \"the Monkey Messiah\". He was the spiritual leader behind an esoteric religion that she could only explain as \"the -Wolf- who- Eats- the- Body- of- God\".\nJanus then cryptically added:\n\"It's important that you meet him.\"\nIn no time at all they were dining with the religious leader of Communitaria, the Monkey Messiah, and in the late hours of the feast it became a drunken orgy of alcohol, and screaming monkeys throwing their own feces.\nThe Monkey Messiah recognized a stranger at his table, who of course, was the Last Sailor. He yelled across the table at him.\n\"YOU - STRANGER! Tell me what you have seen of my America. How does 'the Wolf' eat 'the body of God' in your eyes? Tell me, or my monkeys will shit on you!\"\nThe Last Sailor nodded at him.\n\"Let's get some more drinks poured, and then you'll have your cable monkey man.\"\nThat was done, and before the Last Sailor could begin his accounts of what he had seen of America, Janus the Engineer, pagan soldier and defender of her people, said a prayer underneath her breath.\nThe Last Sailor removed a harmonica from his coat pocket, and played the opening bars of an instantly recognizable tune. The song was famous.\nIt was the 'Star Spangled Banner.'\nHe then spoke in a voice comfortable with the powers of alcohol, and the powers of storytelling. His voice had an easy gait to it, as he began to explain himself.\nIt was obvious from the start he would reveal little about his past.\n\"My name is Anacreon Oregenamen, and in this age of our subjugated planet, under the yoke of the Octopi Incorporated Lords, we see a glimmer of hope in the heavens. In the dual moon sky of Luna and Ceres, we see some cause for celebration...\"\n\"But not much...\"\n\"My story begins in America with great loss. I am here because I have no where else to go. The days of adventure on the seas of the Pacific are over for me. My friends are dead, and the flames of destruction have made a humiliating trophy of the figurehead that my life one was...\"\n\"But my story of loss is not special. It's not more important than anyone else's stories of loss. In the land of my ancestors, I understand that great pendulums of history have swung back and forth. Justice is in transit continually here. What is wrong is eventually righted in America. No culture can truly supersede another culture, without some form of resurgence happening here. I have some faith in this, but I think I pale in importance to all the other injustices in America which need to be corrected...\"\n\"I will wait my turn...\"\nAnacreon Oregenamen began with the California Archipelago, the first stop he had made in the land of America.\n\"I suppose you all have your own fables and tales of Golden California to go along with your ideas of Classic America. I've heard that California is referred to as the mythical Atlantis of America, a place to incredible to believe, lost forever beneath the ocean during the Tribulations, its secrets only myths, and that is all, and no more. I can only tell you of what I have seen. Nothing remains of what California used to be.\"\n\"The people that remain there now on the islands and atolls of what is left of California are truly amazing- and as equally horrifying. I think they've found the true meaning of California that its earlier technological predecessors never connected with. California has always been a place of upheaval and always temporary. The primitives that live there now understand that their lives on that land, like the land itself, is not permanent.\"\n\"That makes them real Californians...\"\nAnacreon talked about his next stop, and a place he knew too well, the waterport city of Viva Las Vegas.\n\"Some say that the gold coffers of ancient Las Vegas are the last vestiges of the richness America once had, and, once was. Some talk about it like it's the proof of a fabled time. If that is true, and that greatness is supposed to mean armed thuggery, and state-support of piracy against the weak and unprotected, then the Gran' Duchy of Viva Las Vegas is indeed the last bastion of an American greatness...\"\n\"Crime\"\n\"What I've seen is a city ready to sell away its own safety for the price of American 'creature comforts.' The pirate mercenary fleets of Viva Las Vegas have been granted port and call in the city as long as they keep the golden life of the city protected for all its citizens. Now, it's a city over run with the very mercenaries hired to protect it. The horror of that reality is something that the rebel muses of the city sing about. They hope that Viva Las Vegas may truly- 'live.'\"\n\"At the cost of getting their dosages of golden age America, ancient Las Vegas enjoys a macabre death show, live and televised.\"\nAnacreon went on to explain the last stop he had made in America. It was Deseret, the Mormon kingdom in the land also known as Utah.Anacreon went on to explain the last stop he had made in America. It was Deseret, the Mormon kingdom in the land also known as Utah.\n\"In the house that Brigham built, and Jonathan Saul Lee almost destroyed, there is a gentle prosperity that Moab Stevens saved. It's called the Kingdom of Deseret, Mormon Zion, where the green alkaline valleys are hoisted upright by the words of the Old Utah saints...\"\n\"Here my canoe first ground ashore, and I looked straight into the pounce of the Lion of Judah. When I would have expected a challenge because I was a trespasser in the 'Kingdom of God,' I was instead greeted with assistance, and this hospitality, came from a people who had repeatedly been persecuted by outsiders. These people, that have had to repeatedly send out their own Nauvoo Legions to keep 'Hannibal away from the gates,' instead welcomed me, when they had every reason to shoo me away. This confounded me. Why the openness? Where was their anger at being tricked time and time again by those with the crueler hearts?\"\n\"I did not expect to meet such a reaction in America, the land of my ancestors.\"\nIt was then that the winds of debate entered the tale of Anacreon. A draft swept itself from the shoulders of the Monkey Messiah. He spoke loud and clear.\n\"What bothers you, is that our Mormon cousins, should have never have helped you at all, is that right?\"\nAnacreon responded.\n\"Given I was a stranger, yes. Given again, their long history of being persecuted by outsiders- why should they have trusted me?\"\nThe Monkey Messiah screeched with laughter.\n\"Who said they trusted you, dear sailor? The point is- yes, they as a people have been visited by death more often than not, but that opens them up to life. Being comfortable with the hardships is not closing up oneself.\"\nAnacreon disagreed.\n\"Fate is cruel, monkey man.\"\nThe religious leader of Communitaria screeched.\n\"Listen to the twisted branches of my life, and hear how more cruel we can be than fate, when we fear that imminent death, of any kind, at the other end of every action we think of taking. When that happens, life doesn't open up. It's closed upon itself, creating- the pain of life we see all around us.\"\nJanus the Engineer, pagan soldier, spoke at this moment.\n\"The storyteller is the vessel of blame, unless he accepts his burden as the wise fool- Tell our guest Anacreon about the Astronaut-Who-Fell-To-Earth...\"\nIn that instant, more liqueurs of wildness were poured. The room of acolytes and monkeys became excited with the expectancy of hearing the Monkey Messiah's tale. Obviously, the tale was a popular one among them all.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I was more like the rest of us now, less than human, I guess.

Ceres the Season Bringer is a welcome reminder that their brief interregnum of tyranny is doomed. Humanity cannot step back from the vast changes of the Brigda Era. Because of her, we now have a mutant empress who sits in ritual subjugation. She sits in nothing more than a kitchen chair.\"\nAfter much adieu, the Monkey Messiah explained his origins.\nThey were incredible, for his earlier life couldn't have been more different than the one he lived at that Montana instant.\nIt began in the \"Reformed United States of America,\" rebuilt on some of the guidelines of the original federal union. This \"second coming\" had been established in a series of fits and starts circa the year 2112 c.b.e. It had been recreated by the Great Amish Awakening following the Failing of Failings, with some major differences...\nThe constitution of the government was not based upon \"democracy.\"\nCommunism was its raison de'tat, risen like an Athenian phoenix.\nHumorously, most followers of American Revivalism had little respect for this \"USA,\" and it was sometimes politically referred to as the \"Union of the Soviet Americas,\" in reference to its Commonrealm timeperiod origins, and more of a put down, than a fitting example of respect.\nThe Monkey Messiah went on to explain that his prior life had been spent in the Amish homeland of Ohio, one of the \"soviet\"-states of the \"USA.\" He had served in the army of a political scion named Robert Paul Luke, the young ducal-estate marshal of a powerful real estate fief that had become embroiled in a power struggle between the forces of rural protection and urban encroachment, the traditional age-old struggle in America.\nRobert Paul Luke's greatest accomplishment in the Amish homeland of Ohio had been the creation of the Twin Towers, a symbol of the greatness and ingenuity of the rural people in his real estate fief. The Twin Towers then became the seat of the High Estates General, and whoever controlled the floor of the real estate feudal council was allowed to name the intendants of governance for all of the Estates.\nThe Monkey Messiah's memories of Ducal-Sire Robert Paul Luke became important here. No one person more embodied the Dark Age of the planet Earth than R.P. Luke - the Cobra Warlord.\n\"As a conscript in his Army, I saw him transform into what he is known as today: the Cobra Warlord. I can guarantee he is still the destructive and angry young boy that he was when I lived in his estate. He was cruelly born to be the very manifestation of the vengeful spirit in the countryside, and its battle with the forces of despoilage became his battle...\"\"He loved the Classical ways, and he idealized himself being clothed in the golden ratios and triangles like he was some great knight, in defense of the old ways of the countryside. But what drove him to become the bloodthirsty warlord he is known as today was his very descent into the pageantry for all the trappings of the military. This dark valley led him to the resurrection of past technologies of warfare and unwittingly, this resurrection of the dead brought with it also the evil spirits attached to these totems of war...\"\n\"He was the assemblage demon-child, possessed to suffer unto himself...\"\nThe Monkey Messiah retold his life as a conscript in the citizen army of Ducal-Sire R.P. Luke. This was a time when R.P. Luke had been ousted from the High Estates General, and the Twin Towers, by a more powerful real estate fief. This same estate had been instrumental in the popularity of American Revivalism and the return of the suburban frontier days of old. The marshals of this estate were the brother and sister tandem, known to the simple people as \"The General,\" and \"The Muskrat Bitch.\" Their takeover and ousting of the Cobra Warlord from the High Estates had resulted in their intendant real estate privilege to live in the superficial glamour of quasi-\"Classic America,\" recreated in the Twin Towers, complete with power steering and full reclining seats.\nThe Monkey Messiah returned with a voice of urgency to his story.\n\"As a conscript in R.P. Luke's army, on the real estate enemy border, we watched the normal day unfold into a day of bizarre sights. A new world dropped into our laps...\"\n\"We watched in awe as surface-to-air missiles were fired from the feudal mansion of R.P. Luke. It took a minute for the explosions to be heard, and it was almost impossible to see the explosions in the sky at all, due to the miles high elevation that the missiles had flown to hit their target. We strained our eyes to the sky, and seconds later we saw a parachute. Upon closer observation we saw that there was an escape capsule attached to the end of it. We knew full well what it was - the Cobra Warlord had shot down a spacecraft as it had been trying to illegally land on the Earth...\"\nThe next part of the Monkey Messiah's tale was incredible.\nThe garrison of conscripts that he had been stationed with ran over to the escape capsule when it landed nearby. Inside they found a sole astronaut, still alive, but barely. She was Asian, which meant she was from the Outer Planets, the homes of the expansion of civilization into the Solar System ever since the closing days of the Great Partition. The astronaut had been shot down because her ship had been attempting to violate the rules of that charter. She was barely alive, and there was nothing they could do to save her.\nBut as the Monkey Messiah next explained, the astronaut had not wanted to be saved.\nHere lay the power of the Monkey Messiah to tell a story.\nThe Monkey Messiah spoke as the distant ancestors, and family cousins, of the human race; the extinct Great Apes of the planet Earth. This was his religion, and the reason he was called \"the Monkey Messiah.\" He became his own god, and words followed that reached the heart of his audience, and more importantly, the heart of the Last Sailor. The Monkey Messiah had reached the beginning of the real story he wanted to tell the Last Sailor, Anacreon Oregenamen.\nThe Monkey Messiah would attempt to transmute a story of death into a story of life.\nHe continued to speak reverently.\n\"She told us that she had already been saved. How? It had to do with the story she told us of her life, lived in the heavens, on worlds unlike our own, where human civilization had taken risks in its own evolution...\"\n\"This is her story. The story of my death and her life, intertwined because of our mutual triumph to achieve both, fear neither, and heal one another...\"\n\"It's the story about how a wounded planet Earth can be whole, like it once was before, and how all of us can enjoy life again...\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

I know what weapon they are using on your people. I have blueprints for it in my satchel. Furthermore, one well-placed insider is choreographing this attack. I can recognize that person...\"\nGeneral Artiken looked down at Chase's urine-soaked pants and sniffed in disgust. It reminded him of a POW camp in Asia he once visited. Chaotic information streamed into Site Intel: light-weapons fire, dozens of men and women possibly dead and\/or blinded. No one had yet seen the attackers. They destroyed the sensitive surveillance cameras at the main gate and on the towers as if by pointing them toward the sun. An insider could have done that part. So much happened in a few minutes that it must be a massive attack.\n\"Sergeant, take the satchel and give me a report on what is in it in five minutes.\" He looked piercingly into Chase's eyes. \"Chase, is it? Cut the crap and tell me what weapons they are using and how many there are.\" \"They're using a gas that affects the optic nerve. Plus some sort of laser technology. I have a schematic that I stole from them... \" Chase motioned to the satchel being dumped out on a table.\n\"And what about this insider? Give me a name.\" The General crossed his arms.\n\"I don't have a name,\" Chase conceded. He looked down at his feet and paused momentarily. \"But I can identify the person from their right arm. He or she is in your main control center - you take out that person and their attack will fail.\"\nFive minutes later after a long elevator ride down, Chase found himself inside the Master Control Bunker of Cheyenne Mountain, home of NORAD.\nA few seconds after that, the five guards inside the bunker were blinded and Chase was in possession of one Mach-10 fully-automatic machine pistol. Some three dozen technicians manned console that day, plus five strategists, eight advisors, and seven others of top military brass. General Artiken and General Considene both wore five stars.\nChase instructed the blind guards to strip to their underwear, then sit on their knees and keep quiet or he would kill them. It seemed like he watched himself from a few feet away... heard himself talk and threaten these people, and mean it. Meanwhile, he fiddled with the Mach-10 and figured out how the safety worked, and made sure a cartridge was in the chamber.\n\"It has to be this way, General. The truth is that there is a conspiracy and I am here to stop it. Desperate times, desperate measures, and all that. Make no mistake Artiken, I'll kill you too if you try something. I see that look - you better strip down to your skivvies... all of you military heroes.\"\nIn ten minutes, it would be midnight in Jerusalem and officially January 1, 2001. It marked the beginning of the legitimate Third Millennium. It also marked the first anniversary of his Quest. The previous year, when Y2K came and went with eerie peacefulness, it ironically signified the beginning of a horror that now consumed the last of his simple middle-class life. That day a year ago had been grand, cross-country skiing in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. He had reflected on his life, and Life, and felt that deep indigenous bond that made some call her Mother Earth.\n...But while eating stew and relaxing in the cabin that night, his mind had fit many disjoint pieces of a large puzzle together. The \"curve fit the data\" flawlessly. How could one summarize the last year? It had all happened so gradually. A year ago his family boasted of him being the first professional engineer in their lineage. Now he blinded people by the dozens and soon probably would blow his own brains out in one last insane act. One of his relatives, a traditionalist who lived on a reservation in Montana had said, \"The Spirits are brow-beating your Twin and he is brow-beating you to do something about it.\"\nChase pointed the gun at a woman in the nearest arc of computer workstations. \"I bet you have some gum in your purse. Give it to me.\"\n\"We're not allowed to have personal belongings in the control center - I don't have a purse here,\" she responded.\nChase's mouth and throat had become so dry that it was hard to talk. He walked to the back of the room and found an alcove with a coffee table and snack dispenser. Coffee and gum. Yeah.\nHe felt twisted up inside - \"soul torque\" he called it - and wanted to bash his own head against the metal walls, even rip his own skin off - anything to escape fate. Clearly, if things did not go right, his only recourse was suicide. He pulled a knife out of his biker's riding boot and casually cut a geometric pattern in one arm, then watched the rivulets of blood with morbid curiosity. If he could only hold together for a little while longer, that is all he asked... of the spirits and gods.\nOne of the technicians in the front ring of computer consoles was staring at him. Chase met his stare and pointedly asked, \"WHAT?\"\n\"You have a laser mounted in that Harley helmet. That's how you did it. The blindness... .\" The man had Asian or possibly Spanish features and wore small, round spectacles.\n\"Yeah. Actually two lasers. One with a line-generating prism for short-range mass attacks, and the other with modest divergence at a quarter mile - good for blowing CCD tubes in cameras.\"\nThe technician added, talking in the direction of General Artiken, \"That's why he wears the goggles, to protect himself from reflected laser light. I bet ultraviolet. He probably doesn't even ride a motorcycle.\"\n\"Soon enough it shall all be explained. You are clever, 'Chang'. So are all of you, I bet. Please don't be too clever? I will tell you this now... \" A moment passed; the drums had been beating and he had briefly dissociated, as if in a dream. \"... If Jesus does not return sometime in the next hour or so then my attack shall be over. Can you be patient for one hour without trying to pull something? That way, everyone gets out of this alive.\" Chase kept glancing at an older technician in the outer-most arc of consoles. The man effetely refused to look at Chase.\n\"Chase, you've thrown your life away,\" General Artiken admonished, gently. \"You know it, and I know it... there's no need to put the security of the United States at risk,\" General Artiken stated using his most reasonable voice. The question was how to get this nut in a body bag and out of here without the press hearing about it.\n\"The best we can do is promise you a fair trial, son,\" General Considene added. Artiken signaled to him to keep quiet.\n\"What is it, son? Drugs? Mental illness? You're a Christian and you want Jesus to come back?\" Artiken took a step forward, then stopped as the gun lifted upward an inch.\n\"I am insane General. I know it. I didn't used to be. The spirits have driven me completely mad - they made me come here. I loved them, and they have driven me to this.\"\n\"Son, we can get you medical help.\" Artiken sat down on a high stool next to a large flat planning table. \"Surprised really that you would be into all that religious stuff. You don't look the type. You're waiting on Jerusalem aren't you? Well look at the theatre map - it's already midnight in Israel. No Jesus... \"\n\"I'm not the type for this shit either. Dreams like you could not imagine General. Even when I'm awake. Even right now. What could it be? Brain cancer maybe?\"\n\"Maybe son... We would have to run you through the hospital to find out. Why don't you give me the gun and not frighten these good people anymore?\" The General stepped forward gently, and the gun sagged in Chase's weary hand. \"Are you an Indian then? Is that it?\" He took another step forward.\n\"I'm nothing. Mixed blood. Half of me wants to design computer hardware and the other half belongs to the spirits. I don't fit in anywhere.\" Indeed midnight in Jerusalem had passed. Chase eyed the barrel of the Mach-10. The spirits had misled him, and no doubt a coyote somewhere was mocking him.\n\"Sure, suicide is an easy way out... but I think you're strong enough to endure the struggle to get out of this mess. I'm sure your family wants to see you come out of this.\" The General had seen that glance at the gun. That seemed like a nice, neat solution. He decided to let Chase keep the gun a little longer. \"I'm surprised \"the spirits\" did not tell others to come help you. Didn't that seem odd to you? Are they talking to you right now? What are they telling you to do?\"\nA wall-mounted array of television screens monitored three dozen civilian channels. Chase noticed the CNN channel did indeed provide a live telecast of Jerusalem to commemorate the moment. A huge crowd of several hundred thousand of various faiths had assembled for the moment.\n\"I want to hear what CNN has to say about Jerusalem. Give me audio on that screen. Not really any point in waiting an hour. You know how this ends, General. ... Umm...the spirits? They said an army would not get inside this mountain but a single man could. They told me the tricks to use, like how to get you to bring me to this room.\" Chase coughed raggedly and wiped his nose on a sleeve. \"It seemed so real. They said I was expendable... I guess like in case they - in case I - was wrong.\"\nLoud cheering from a sea of people made it difficult to hear Derrick Bolton of CNN. He reported in his best professional, albeit patronizing voice, that bizarre strong growing winds and unheard of hail in Jerusalem made this historic moment even more meaningful for the faithful. Another announcer quipped something about being thankful it was not locusts.\n\"What tribe are you with, son,\" General Considene asked. Chase was staring out into space. Considene made a gesture to Artiken. Artiken was a little closer to Chase, and certainly much faster. He naturally should be the one to tackle the gunman.\nThere was the sound of a beating drum and chanting from several men. Chase felt power flowing into his body, strengthening him. Something foreign was pushing into Mother Earth, causing great turmoil. Briefly he saw the roiling clouds in Israel. They towered several miles high. Something was in them. Briefly, the face of a man looking into his eyes, blessing him. Then being propelled up like a bubble in a deep well. Up, up, up!\nGeneral Artiken hit Chase squarely on the chin and tossed him flatly onto his back. The drums disappeared and or became his pounding heart.\nChase rolled with surprising agility, brought the Mach-10 level and fired a burst at the older techie along the aisle of the last arc of consoles. One bullet hit the man squarely in the forehead. He dropped like a sack of potatoes. The General froze, then backed away.\n\"Awright people! Who wants to be the next hero? Turn up that station!\" Chase commanded.\nJesus had returned.\nFive of the television screens now switched to live coverage of Israel. Actually, the cameras sat motionlessly because the camera people and journalists had abandoned them. One could see the surroundings swathed in bright light as if it from the sun, except the shadows fanned out in a way that could only be done by a nearby light source.\nOne of the cameras tilted slightly up, and it caught the dynamic play of light on the clouds and buildings. Clearly, a huge (miles high?) animated humanoid shape illuminated from above produced these indirect lighting effects.\nComplete, utter chaos rippled across the entire planet in minutes. Cheyenne Mountain was no different. Working cameras at other gates displayed personnel streaming out of the site. General Artiken stood speechless, as did everyone. He considered unlocking the security doors and walking out, shooter or no shooter.\n\"General, I'm getting reports that the civilian communication channels are failing. I have phone blackouts along both eastern and western seaboards and spreading. Military satellites still have bandwidth,\" reported one techie.\nThe most unforgettable moment in the history of the world arrived and it defied words. Belief systems crumbled. Egos crumbled. Petty rivalries and past tragedies slipped from memory instantly. The intensity of the moment even made a couple people in the room faint. A simple image of light and shadows on the television monitor made two techies faint briefly. Such was the impact of such an event on the human psyche.\n\"I'm leaving, and you cannot stop me, Satan,\" a woman in the second arc pronounced as she stood up and headed to the sealed security door.\n\"How many televisions do you have at home?\" Chase queried. Chase could not afford to kill any high-functioning techies just yet. \"Because we have thirty-six on this wall alone. \"Plus, you cannot open the door. Plus this is ground zero for what happens next and you don't want to miss it. Plus... if you don't sit down someone is going to die... maybe you, maybe someone else.\"\nShe said nothing, and returned to her station.\n\"You military boys ever wonder what the best way to conquer an enemy is?\" Chased asked them, provocatively. \"I'm thinking of Cortez and his five-hundred men conquering tens of thousands of armed Aztec warriors in their own land. You know how he did it Considene? Artiken? Anyone?\"\nSilence. Eight of the broadcast stations idly displayed their station ID.\n\"Superior firepower sure. The foreign disease they brought helped too. It traveled through the Indians faster than the Spaniards did. Good military strategy sure - unite their enemies against them. Something else helped too....\" Chase paused to look at their faces. Some of the technicians continued to work, even amidst all the drama.\n\"Their own religion,\" General Artiken barked out.\n\"Yes! Their own religion prophesied that men with beards would come from the east, destroy them and their gods, and rule them. They would bring 'big deer'. So when the Spaniards arrived with their cows, the natives - both the Aztecs and the Mayans - were already convinced that they would lose.\"\nGeneral Artiken started to say something, but Chase wearily beckoned for him to refrain. \"That isn't the best way though. Even better, would be to have the people so afraid of you that they didn't dare even try to fight in the first place. And better then that would be to have the people so afraid that they eagerly welcome you and your few men into their country and fight over who will be your best servant. Now people, can anyone imagine a better conquest than that?\"\nGeneral Artiken stared at him, and blinked rapidly, but said nothing.\nOne of the cameras moved and swiveled to suddenly provide a direct image of Jesus in all his glory. A woman journalist, bleeding from a scalp laceration, animatedly bobbed in and out of the picture at one side.\n\"Jack! Are we live? ...As you can see here, it is total chaos. Jesus has in fact returned. I love you Bobby, and Nicole. The crowds are totally, totally out of control here. This reporter has never seen anything even close to this. You can see there is golf-ball size hail now. Very dangerous. You can hear the roar of the chanting behind me.... I don't know how long this transmission will be up. Evidently our staff back in New York has mostly left the station. No one is there to provide commentary at that end. Peter? We're counting on you to stick this out and keep the transmission up. Can you do that? Jack, pan over Jesus from head to foot.\"\nChase shakily ran a hand through his short black hair. All of the technicians stopped their work. Jesus, in all his luminous glory stood with one foot in Jerusalem and his head in the clouds some five miles high. He could be seen directly no doubt for hundreds of miles.\n\"I am trying to get some of the other journalists here involved,\" the reporter continued. She did not know that she was the only one providing coverage of this momentous event. \"The communication lines are saturated, so I cannot coordinate as we normally would. I don't know what you are seeing at home.... Frankly, words are failing me. I can tell you how I feel. I'm scared, very scared. There's a good chance I'll be dying here. People are getting trampled to death all around me, and more are streaming into the area at an alarming rate. I'm guessing the borders are down and people are pouring in from everywhere.\"\nChase noticed her shaking little hand with the microphone and his heart went out to her.\nShe continued. \"As you can see, He must be several ummm... miles high. Right now He is looking around the area. He has not spoken. The actual feet are - what would you guess Jack? I would say perhaps a thousand feet off of the ground. He is luminous, yet solid. You can see the shadows produced from the light. The bright light that is lighting up the area appears to be coming from a ring-like halo above His head. It lights up the whole area like it was noon. It's a strange sort of light, but I'm no scientist. I don't have the tools to describe it, really.\"\nGeneral Considene sat at the communications console with a techie. They tried to contact the President of the United States, but he could not be reached even over the satellite dedicated channel. Finally the Secretary of State was reached and she indicated that both the President and Vice-President could not be pulled away from hasty discussions with other world leaders. She was sorry that NORAD was under terrorist attack but that nothing really could be done from their end. She hung up on the General.\n\"Give me audio on CNN,\" Chase ordered. His mind had cleared and he felt almost like himself again.\nLynn Russell, her mascara smeared, transferred control to a journalist at the White House. Evidently the President soon planned to give a press conference to the half-dozen waiting reporters.\n\"Thank you Lynn. Information is non-existent at this point, really. I understand the President has talked with several leaders - Apparently Tony Blair of England for one. Wait! Here he comes now!\"\nThe camera panned to watch the President stride out to the podium. His rounded shoulders and grim expression said a lot before he even reached it.\n\"Men and women of the world. That blessed day which we have all held on for... each in our own ways... has finally arrived. This begins the Day and Age of Jesus, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. Some of you are thinking this is a national emergency. Our communication is virtually completely down. Our transportation is rendered useless by clogged highways and unmanned airports. Our medical facilities are virtually unmanned, yet tremendous numbers of injuries are happening in our own joy and excitement.\" The President paused and drank from a paper cup.\nChase noticed that the President did not read a speech. He said it as he thought it.\n\"We have to calm ourselves down. We have to wait for the words from our Master. Let each of us choose to forget the teachings of our faith in that they have been the shadows of the truth. Now we have the truth and no longer need speculate. We no longer need to be divided in our faith and our love. We no longer need to fear our neighbor. We no longer need to think in terms of villages and states and nations. We are now ONE WORLD under God. I take this moment to say to my Lord and savior that I consider Him my Master, and consider myself a tarnished but undefeated warrior in the battle for the faith.\"\nOver the next couple of hours everyone in the control room watched with unmitigated awe as the drama played out throughout the world. The President could not be contacted during that time.\nIn the United States, the impact had been immediate and complete. Every man, woman, and child old enough to fear, professed their deep and enduring love for Jesus. Except for the blind soldiers and the other hostages in the control room, Cheyenne Mountain virtually vacated. From Mormon to Protestant to Catholic to American Indian, it seemed everyone celebrated Jesus with a certain shrill joy.\nThe Hindus, the Buddhists, and even the Mayans and Incans praised him one and all. Apparently their faiths actually all worshiped Jesus in differing ways, but \"this was not commonly understood\". Now that their eyes were open, they claimed to see how all truly are brothers and sisters under God. Even the polytheists clarified that they worshiped one \"God of All Creation\" that oversaw the other lesser gods. So really, all the trouble on Earth had simply been a big misunderstanding.\nThe entire world truly belonged to Jesus. No one was His enemy.\nExcept for Chase.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

These cataclysms of nature were called the Tribulations, and they destroyed the only rival power that could have stopped the Von Strauven takeover, and creation, of the world-state.\nThis rival power was the all-woman Seattle Contingency, and its destruction by the eruption of nearby Mt. Rainier, had happened in the same year as the final earthquakes had finished the rift sea in the interior of California, and completed the million year sinking of Atlantean California.\nThe year was 2882.\nThe family of Von Strauven, with the support of what would later be called the 'Octopi Incorporated' seduced the 'reformed' United States of America.\nThey manipulated the communist bureaucracy of the USA to set up their nascent global imperium.\nOnly three rival powers stood in the way of there being a Von Strauven emperor, head of a world-state.\nThese rivals, were opponents to the idea of a global imperium because of their adherence to the Codes of Community, as created by the vanished Commonrealm of Nations. These rivals were; the Taigan Philosophers of Holartic, the Toltec Nasach, and the Peoples King of the Chin.\nAt 12:05 a.m. 2882 common Brigda Era, the family of Von Strauven launched preemptive nuclear missile strikes against these rivals. At 12:15 am, sanity prevailed.\nThe Limited Nuclear Exchange was over.\nA global conference was held, the first in almost 800 years.\nGlobal consciousness was dead. The devastated rival societies arrived at a mutual decision.\nThe Great Partition.\nThe nations of Asia, angry and humiliated that yet, another atomic slagging had been visited upon their homes by so-called \"western civilization,\" had only one condition for the Von Strauven-led world-state, and his nascent imperium.\nAll of the celestial bodies in the Solar System, planets and worlds and \"others\" would be allotted to the nations of Asia, and whomever else dissented to a proclamation of a Von Strauven emperor. The Asian-led exodus into outer space would merely follow the lead of one of their own, the space explorer Zhenghe the Awesome, and no nations knew the value of the Outer Planets better than the nations of Asia. If anyone could make a civilization in the harsh wilderness of outer space, it was the descendants of the brave space explorer, Zhenghe.\nThe Von Strauvens agreed. They could gladly head their feudal imperium on the planet Earth. Consequently, the Moon was thrown in like a poker chip. Anything past the orbit of the Moon would be considered a violation of the Great Partition, and vice versa.\nIt hardly mattered to the nations of Asia, as they left on their mass exodus into outer space. They were glad to leave behind the pain and misery of Wicked Old Earth. It was they who would profit from the Great Partition.\nThey would adapt to their new worlds\nThey would not make these worlds adapt to them.\nThey would be One with Nature, in whatever forms it showed appeared.\nThe first wicked lights of the morning sun cut through the frost born of the cold Montana night In a dark room full of all-night beer drinkers and hell raisers, the first rays of light helped touch-up the drunken features of this congregation. Plates of hot bread were passed around, with compliments of homemade butter. It was washed down with strong, dark coffee.\nAnacreon Oregenamen thanked the Forever.\nJanus Southcross took a position of respect for the Sephiroth.\nThe Monkey Messiah was his own god. He lustily ate the body of his father, the cronial god that he was, and washed him down with hot coffee.\nHe returned to his story.\n\"The Astronaut-Who-Fell-To-Earth recriminated Western Civilization for its repeated nuclear attacks on the nations of Eastern Civilization. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Emperor Maximillians strikes against the Chinese Empire during the Crisis-and of course, the Limited Nuclear Exchange in 2882...\"\n\"She said the West's continued disagreements with the East was the same reason that the Asian-led exodus of their civilizations into harsh outer space had been so successful... She said it had to do with knowing that humanity is dwarfed before the grandeur of Nature...\"\nAt this point Janus, the soldier of the pagani people known as the Engineers, spoke aloud.\nIt sounded like a call to arms.\n\"The monstrosity of our civilization is the tumor called Christianity. It has manifested this demonocracy into our national psyche to be nothing but happy with leading a stoic world-state. Speaking as a past victim of a Teutonic Knight deathcamp, I have condemned Christianity to be a criminal religion, whose very converts don't act as if they've been saved\"\nAnacreon agreed with the empirical facts of what she said, minus the pagan zealotry. The creation of the 'stoic world-state' Janus was referring to had begun a thousand years ago, during the time of the Emperor Maximillian's failed attempt at ruling the world, born at the same time when the Commonrealm of Nations had been created.\nThe Von Strauven Imperium was just another rung in the ladder.\nTo hell.\nOne thousand years later, and America was left at the reins of this crazed mission, first attempted by its own ancestors: Europe.\nNow, all that America could show for its squandered inheritance was a feudal nightmare, a backwater land that had inherited Western Civilization, and its quest for the stoic world-state, at the cost of its peoples soul.\nFar removed from the realm of Janus's zealous hatred for Christianity's legacy, and Anacreon's silent musings on the state of the land of his ancestors, a strange channeling of spirits entered the Monkey Messiah, and excited his body. He became the Astronaut-Who-Fell-To-Earth, brought back from the great sleep of the dead.\nOnly she would speak now.\nThe Monkey Messiah successfully became a child of the Asian people who had left during the Great Partition. Some of those colonists of outer space had ventured all the way to the icy fringes of the Solar System, where the home sun of the Solar System was just another star in the infinite firmament of the Universe. This was the same location from where the Astronaut-Who-Fell-To-Earth had come from.\nThe double-planet world of Pluto-Charon.\nHer voice overtook all other voices in the room of listeners.\nThe Astronaut-Who-Fell-To-Earth had returned.\n\"My name is Serpina Pro Lu Hoc Lin, no matter if I was blasted out of Earth orbit, and if I might add, the only planet that has ever fired at me, and been unfriendly \"\n\"In your language, my name is Pere-Sephon...\"\n\"I am from the cold planet Pluto-Charon. I am a child raised on the cometary dust of primordial origins, on the fringe, born to gaze into the gales of Deep Heaven. I am nothing more than a part, just another speck in the tail of the Dragon...\"\n\"This is the lair of the Ice Dragon, and I have marveled at it...\"\n\"I was born to be a great space traveler, and raised to be a beckon of light from the cold, infinite dusk of the edge of the solar plane. I was a messenger from Deep Heaven, who rode one of the fastest spaceships of its time; a tachyon ramcollider, a sleek hull of elegant electron-gravity-weld neutrinos. It was all held together in fractions, against the constant molecular destruction. Increased mass with velocity was pulverized constantly again and again...\"\n\"There was an infinite of me alive for every infinite of me dead. The speeds of my ship warped my time, and I lived half a second in oblivion...\"\n\"If you understand oblivion, at least for one terrifying second of your worst nightmare, then you will understand the name of my ship as the Agamennon, and the curse of Deep Heaven upon my ship...\"\nThe channeling continued, as the Voice of Tales brought her back from the sleeping land of the dead, where the Asian astronaut from the double world of Pluto-Charon now dwelled in Stygian slumber.\nThe deceased Pere-Sephon, retold the first successes of her Asian ancestors large scale colonization of the Outer Planets, as decreed by the Great Partition. She went on to explain the first step of their exodus into outer space.\nThis first step had been Mars, the Red Planet, locked into a global ice age, where not a drop of rain had fallen upon its deserts in a million years. It had already been home to the human settlements of the Buren Expedition colonists, who had stayed behind to become the First Martians.\nThe scale of the Great Partition was immense. The First Martians were soon dwarfed by the size and preparation of humanity's second migration to Mars.\nThe first colony ships from Earth began to arrive into Mars space. In a matter of weeks the fleets of deep space rockets, crammed with hopeful, industrious people, outnumbered the few thousand original settlers of Mars. They had arrived, one after another, and then assembled into orbital formation, to make preparations for landing on the planet.\nEvery Martian day, another overloaded lander, full of the families of Greater East Asia , had begunn to descend onto the hardscrabble land of Mars, and set up homes in the canyon walls and dusty plains, to live off what the land gave them:\nThe chance for a \"real\" peace that would last.\nMars had become the Middle Kingdom in a matter of hurried months.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Their goal was almost achieved. They could just make out the eerie Tor against the starry sky. A few weak lights at ground level marked the New Monastery. They maneuvered their small, quiet groundcar forward down the macadamized side road and across the causeway bridging Avalon's restored surrounding waters until the monastery church loomed ahead.\nThe monks were gratified that the current tyrant, King Henry IX of United England, had reversed his namesake's actions: he had ruralized the town of Glastonbury and had refounded Glastonbury Abbey under the name of its legendary apostolic founder.\n\"We'll leave the car here and walk.\"\nFollowing proper escape procedure, Brother Faganus turned the vehicle around and parked it pointing toward the main road.

These were their operational names, taken from ancient Britonic history. The monks were members-regular of the Holy Order of Assassins. They were well-trained and experienced. This was not their first mission. As the True Church expanded with humankind into the immensity of the Milky Way galaxy, it acquired many unconventional orders of monastics and a diverse body of near-heretical belief among its adherents on the far-scattered worlds. No knowledgeable prelate in Rome was troubled, though, by the Church's secret order of killers. Monks had always spearheaded the Holy Faith, and the worlds beyond Earth were very dangerous places. The Church's mortal enemies were to be found on nearly every one.\n\"That new age rabble should be well-asleep after their big supper, Brother. The Holy Data classifies them as a self-indulgent order. They don't arise to chant Matins and Lauds, you know.\"\nBrother Deruvianus, the junior assassin, had been assigned to this mission because of his large photographic memory of useful facts. He was also skilled at knifework. With his trusty Swiss multitooled pocketknife, he gathered much useful intelligence: techint and humint.\nThe monks were here to procure a very valuable thing for their Order. That this object was believed to be in the possession of another order of monks was irrelevant. The Holy Assassins took what they desired, and Rome looked the other way. Their unusual service to the Church accorded them special privileges.\nThey stole through the night to the monastery's gate. As they guessed, the lazy gatekeeper was asleep. On the gate's massive wooden door was posted a helpful sign:\nSHRINE OF THE HOLY GRAIL\nFootpath -->\nThe two assassins proceeded boldly along the finely-gravelled hiking trail to the base of the Tor. Where the trail turned upward, they hesitated not but plunged ahead, using their spylamps sparingly. The climb to the top of the Tor was a fatiguing one, but both were too excited to tire. Soon enough, the tower of the Shrine appeared ahead, silhouetted against the spangled firmament, which now showed some dark clouds.\n\"Where do you suppose King Arthur is really buried?\" asked Deruvianus. \"This information is missing from the Holy Database.\"\n\"I don't know, but I'm certain that the relics in the pilgrim church, below, aren't his... Forget about Arthur's bones. Keep focused on our mission.\"\nThe trail leveled out. They had finally reached the top of the Tor.\n\"There it is: the Shrine - formerly the Chapel of St. Michael,\" supplied Deruvianus. \"Nicely restored, and illuminated inside, it seems.\"\n\"Quiet now. There may be a night-guard,\" cautioned Faganus.\nThey reached the ornate, doorless entrance. One at each side, they snapped quick looks within. NO GUARD, signalled Faganus with handtalk.\nThe two assassins stepped into the ground-floor interior and found themselves in a strange kind of place. The room was bare and devoid of furnishings. The stonework was minimally-decorative and the floor a functional surface of red tiles. The ceiling was high but plain. The chamber was cast as stark and, one might say unreligious, by its institutional fluorescent lighting. Stairs to the overlook at the top of the tower were in one corner.\n\"It looks like the lobby of an office building,\" commented Faganus. \"Or an ancient bus station waiting room without the seats,\" added Deruvianus from his mindstore of historical knowledge. \"Not a holy shrine.\"\nAgainst the far wall was a large, blue metal box. \"Gracious Father!\" A window in the box displayed what they sought. \"It's the Grail!\"\nThe two assassins rushed forward and stood, staring at the object within the box. Printed above the window were these incredible words:\nHOLY GRAIL\nManual Included\n99 credits\nInterGalacta Cards Only\n\"It's a v-v-vending machine,\" interpreted Deruvianus, haltingly. His senior, struck speechless with shock, ground his teeth.\nBehind the machine's display window was a simple bronze chalice. Under it was a colorful pamphlet. Faganus attempted to read its title, but that was covered by the chalice's base. His face became a mask of angry frustration, and he finally found his words.\n\"This is an outrage! An absolute outrage!... This can't be the Holy Grail. It's a cruel joke of some kind. Those tourist monks must have the real one hidden somewhere in the monastery.\"\n\"What do we do then, Brother?\"\n\"Give me your InterGalacta Card.\"\nAs the two monk-assassins trudged down the footpath from the Shrine of the Holy Grail, Brother Deruvianus used his spylamp to read to Brother Faganus the preface of the pamphlet:\n\"The so-called Holy Grail has been the spurious subject of many legends. These legends are a farrago of ancient Celtic folktales, Christian apocrypha, heretic cult-wisdom, and the fantasy fiction of ancient and modern writers. Oddly, the Grail legend continues to grow as humankind advances among the stars. New cults, distorted interpretations of historical Christianity, and the absurd creations of media writers have both expanded the lore of the Holy Grail and collapsed it into a black hole of human belief which pulls into its dark interior those who wish to believe it and who futilely seek it in various places beyond its natal land. Yet these deluded souls achieve only abject failure. In the following pages, the history of the Grail legend is related and a serious attempt is made to demystify it.\n\"Those who have purchased the Monastery's facsimile of the putative Holy Grail will find in Appendix A of this pamphlet instructions for 'antiquing' this genuine bronze chalice to create for it a realistic, ancient appearance.\"\nBrother Faganus attempted a comment. \"This is... is...\"\n\"A disaster, Brother,\" completed Deruvianus. \"Why do these tourist monks seek to demolish the Grail legend?\"\nBrother Faganus was now resigned to the inevitable. \"Administrative reasons, probably. They have to sustain the legend of the Isle of Avalon - and Glastonbury-as-Avalon. They have to pander to the manifold King Arthur legend. And of course, they have to pretend that Joseph of Arimathea founded their original house. The Holy Grail is just one-too-many legends for them to handle. They gave up trying to explain the Grail and decided to vend it, instead. Early tomorrow, a monk will climb the Tor and replace the chalice we bought with another one for the next gullible visitor.\"\n\"But we can't take this tourist bauble back to our Order and represent it as the Holy Grail. Can we?\"\n\"We can't tell our Grand Master there isn't a Holy Grail, either. Like so many other people, he's certain it exists somewhere here. He'll just send us out again and again until we die of... grailitis.\"\n\"What'll we do?\"\nThe senior assassin pondered the problem as they stumbled down the Tor's steep trail in a pitch blackness. The stars had disappeared. As was typical for Avalon's climate, rain was now imminent. The dark clouds above betokened the mood of the two monks. Their mission had seemingly failed, abjectly. But all was not lost. Holy Assassins are nothing if not resourceful\n\"Read me Appendix A.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The generals, in their underwear, kneeled in prayer on the empty side of the room. Several of the technicians were praying out loud. Chase mused that at least they were no longer contriving to overthrow him - they were too preoccupied.\nWatching the masses in Jerusalem oddly made Chase think back to his childhood - how he would rush to effuse love to his father returning home from work. The same huge father who drunkenly beat him and his mother many a time.\nChase took a long, slow, shakey drag on that Cuban cigar. It was a momento from his last trip to Mexico. \"Alright people, it's show time...\" One of the techies rebuked him in the name of Jesus.\n\"You love Jesus? How many people here love Jesus?\" Chase asked. To a man and woman, they all raised their hands - even the generals. \"Well I love Him too. But He doesn't love me. No, no, he doesn't. He gave me the job of proving His greatness.\nSomeone started singing \"Rock of Ages\" and everyone else began joining in. Chase fired a burst into the floor. \"People. I must use you against your will. I'm going to be doing the unthinkable. And you people, what is your role?\" Chase walked in front of the inner-most ring of consoles. \"Your job is to let God defend Himself. You will be tempted to help Him, but He does not want that. The world must see His glory - He must do it all. Do you understand?\"\nChase walked back to the farthest curved row, where the inert body of the old technician lay curled. \"People, your fate will be worse than that if you don't do as I say. He died quickly, you will die from being gut-shot.\"\nA woman in the front row could not take it any longer. She leaped to her feet. \"You're the Anti-Christ!\" she exclaimed. \"You are no match for Jesus, you... Satan!\" she sputtered hysterically.\n\"Perhaps...\" Chase motioned with the pistol for her to sit down. \"People, one could conclude that I could not break into the control center of Cheyenne Mountain unless it was preordained? Perhaps God wants you to know He understands that I forced you to do something that shall only prove how great He truly is. I take full and complete responsibility for what I am about to make you do. I alone shall bear this heinous burden. Do as I say and no one else need die. This is ordained and you must do your part. If that is Jesus, you will be forgiven. I... probably would not be.\n\"I know what you plan to do,\" General Artiken muttered. He stood up and dramatically walked dangerously close to Chase. \"But it is not going to happen. We are NOT precipitating an attack on Jesus. You can shoot every man and woman in this room but it will not happen.\"\n\"General...\" Chase admonished gently. \"Let's think this through. Certainly, IF I were a terrorist trying to bomb New York city, I would expect everyone of you to die refusing my demands. You would be national heroes and doing the right thing.\" Chase walked in front of the inner ring and let his gaze roll across the faces of all the people.\n\"This is different. Your charter is to defend the United States of America from any and all outside forces. The White House has effectively been destroyed. Oh, not literally...but in the sense that we cannot contact them. Our nation is in a state of chaos. People are dying by the scores. Our world is in chaos. General, I have a question for you.\"\n\"What if this is not really Jesus?\" he said slowly, with measured coolness.\nChase continued with the argument, and did not give the general time to respond. \"On the one hand, we could be turning over the world to an imposter of some sort. Without even trying to defend ourselves. You would be failing this country-indeed, the whole planet. On the other hand, if this is Jesus then surely He can defend Himself from our pitiful missiles. Do you see what I mean?\"\n\"We cannot launch without presidential authority,\" the general hissed.\n\"That is what we are told, isn't it?\" Chase said grinning. \"But you know what? I don't believe it. That would mean another nation could entirely disable our nuclear strike capability by merely first blowing up the White House with one missile-killing the entire chain of command possessing launch authority, in one strike. No, you are buried in this mountain so you can wage nuclear war long after the President and the others are gone.\"\nThe Asian techie near the front eyed General Artiken; how would Artiken handle checkmate? Artiken said nothing and looked over the faces of his people.\n\"As you know, God is great,\" Chase continued without waiting for a reply. \"I have no choice but to attack Him, even if He shall defeat me. I want to know if this is the real Jesus. I am going to fire ten ICBMs. You will target them for the GPS coordinates of that radiant halo structure above the head. Perhaps he is going to neutralize them and destroy me. Then certainly the world will know His power.\" Chase felt like fainting, in fact he did so momentarily - but came to as he was slumping down.\nChase walked over to the wall map of the globe. \"Five will come from the continental U.S. and five more will come from these submarines... here. Make your calculations so that they strike two at a time. Each pair shall have one from Montana, and one from the submarine. As one pair arrives, the next pair will be one hundred miles away. Is that clear?\" Chase was counting on the men in the submarines and the men in the missile silos not yet knowing the news of Jesus' return.\nThe same woman techie blurted out, \"The radiation will kill millions of innocent people, Satan!\" Chase ignored her.\nWithin an hour five missiles launched and proceeded on target. Five missiles had refused to launch. Chase had expected this and only needed five for his strategy. Any other time and Chase would have marveled at the engineering feat. The sheer volume of math and other logistics to get these huge weapons of mass destruction into the air and heading toward a specific spot on the Earth thousands of miles away, was enough to boggle the mind.\nOnly moments after the three land-based missiles had launched, Jesus began speaking for the first time. Everyone, even Chase, gazed awestruck at the monitors.\n\"My children,\" came the booming voice. People pressed away from Jesus now, from the pain of His voice.\n\"The fulfillment of time has come. I stand among my faithful, many dying or suffering in this world, for the honor to sit beside me in the kingdom that now is forming. Your joy warms my heart for I know that what I have prepared for you is not in vain.\"\n\"A few among you, my enemies, shall now be destroyed so that the faithful shall see my power. Their weapons shall be made to fall at my feet.\"\n\"My lambs, my cherished children, I ask that you control your joy, and love one another at this time of great transition. Show your love for me by showing your love to your neighbor.\"\nWith that, Jesus closed His eyes. A beatific smile played across His magnificent face.\nGeneral Artiken locked his steely gaze on Chase, then looked to his people, trying to get a feel for their state of mind.\n\"Ok people,\" Chase shouted. Who has the power to remote detonate these missiles?\"\nGeneral Considene gestured to himself and General Artiken.\n\"No, I mean who seated at the consoles can actually do it.\" The man seated in the elevated console chair looked first to the generals, then nodded slightly.\n\"I want you to set things up so that I can give you an order to detonate any one or all of those birds and you can make it happen within one second. Can you do that?\"\nThe man did not reply. \"What is your name?\" Chase asked. No reply.\n\"I don't care about your military secrets or rank. Or even your soul. Just give me your damn first name.\"\n\"My name is Jason Fleet,\" came the crisp response.\n\"Well Jason, my name is Chase. Do you know how to do what I am telling you to do?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then set it up, and await my commands. Do that now. You need to be ready to go by the time the birds are one-hundred miles from Jesus. According to the watch points set on the wall display, that gives you three minutes.\"\nPeople sat stupefied.\n\"Well go, people!\" Chase shouted, waving the gun convincingly like a madman. That seemed to bump the bubble off dead-center and suddenly the room filled with frantic activity.\nThe first two missiles came in from opposite sides, reaching the one-hundred mile mark within seconds of each other. \"Not bad for hasty computations,\" marveled Chase.\nSuddenly a strange phenomena could be seen emanating from the region of the halo of Jesus, courtesy of the television reporter. A powerful particle beam razed the air, slicing through the clouds. It was eerie to watch from the missile's own video feed, as the beam zeroed in using a figure-eight pattern.\n\"You see the missile He is targeting? I want you to prepare to detonate the other missile. I will command you to detonate it shortly. Got it, Jason?\"\n\"Yes sir,\" Jason replied, cursing himself under his breath for the respectful response.\nThe beam made an ever-tightening pattern and finally zeroed in on the missile. In a moment, the missile sheared in half and disintegrated into pieces. An otherwise inert ball of fire fell Earthward.\nChase watched as the beam began tracking toward the second missile. The missile reached within forty miles of the target.\n\"Detonate, Jason! Detonate!\"\nJason executed a scripted series of steps and the second inbound missile exploded twenty-three miles from Jesus. A 20-megaton high-altitude nuclear EMF pulse devastated any electronics within a fifty-mile radius.\nAll the monitors filled with fuzzy static for the better part of a minute. Most of them never returned, in fact. A few telescope-mounted cameras and some satellite imagery did return.\nJesus stood with arms extended, and a stern expression on His magnificent face. He stood solid as a rock within the maelstrom caused from a nuclear blast.\nThe clouds and the crowds were gone. Low-res non-military satellite imagery displayed a huge, roiling fireball and dark mushroom cloud.\nThe second wave of missiles now crossed the twenty-mile mark. The particle beam restarted but seemed to sputter or pulse erratically; even so it deftly destroyed one missile at close range. The second missile detonated on impact with the halo.\nNo video came back.\nPainfully, Chase gave the order to disable the last missile and let it hit the ground inertly.\nChase ordered the techies to get an enhanced close-up of the site using a shielded spy satellite. That took a full half hour. Millions of people surely died-no one lived to report from the target.\nThe Asian techie displayed it to the monitor wall as soon as it came in.\nA gasp went through the entire room. The devastation. The horror. Infrared imagery indicated a white-hot crater and zone of total annihilation perhaps twenty miles in diameter, at the former site of Jerusalem.\nJesus was gone.\nMinutes went by. A couple of \"Disaster Experts\" on CNN speculated about the sudden loss of all communication from the area and the huge fireballs visible from anywhere in Europe in the night sky. Back at Cheyenne Mountain, everyone expected the wrath of God to be unleashed on Mankind any moment.\nEven Chase.\n\"People, this is not over yet. Generals - put some damn clothes on. We're going to need all of you. You need to find some people over at NASA, if there are any. Have them watch the moon for an invasion fleet coming from its far side. It will probably be small. Interstellar travel has to be... damn expensive.\" Chase collapsed wearily into a chair.\nGeneral Artiken suddenly stood up and bellowed, \"Oh my dear God!\" He walked forward toward Chase numbly, his mouth moving but no more words coming out. Then he repeated the phrase. Chase looked up at him and nodded - the man finally understood. Chase had so much more to say, but physically could not make his mouth work.\n\"Oh my God! People! People!\" The general pulled on his pants and with every step filled with renewed life. \"Dear God in Heaven!\" He was having an epiphany of sorts. He looked at Chase, and shouted, \"How far back does this go?\"\nChase could not speak at all. His eyes were half-closed and his lips quivered.\n\"Tico, give this man your wireless keyboard and pipe it to the display!\" Artiken bellowed.\nChase's fingers moved slowly over the board. Words appeared: \"All the way. They impregnated Mary. Their ship was the star of Bethlehem. Their technology was the magic behind Jesus' healings. Interstellar travel is too expensive to allow an invasion fleet.\"\n\"They used time and brains - perhaps they unlocked a way to live for thousands of years. Would make sense for interstellar travel. They programmed us over the millennia to give up at first site of an icon. Even better than that, to be their joyful slaves under fear of eternal torment. It takes a lot of time to get a global consensus of that depth - but for a whole planet it must be worth it. Maybe the advance scouts set up the Jesus Gambit, and they have been waiting for other ships to arrive while we propagate the consensus among ourselves.\"\nSomeone let out a loud whoop, and then others started to join in. Chase found the energy to wave for them to stop.\n\"Not yet,\" he continued to type. \"It isn't over. General, you know they have a contingency plan. Probably 'bomb them back to stone-age, take slaves to work the land, build more ships, take over planet little by little'. They're shocked that we figured them out, but they aren't done.\"\nChase motioned to Artiken. He was able to croak out a few last words.\n\"The world needs a strong general right now. Use your nukes in space to blow their electronics...\"\n\"I need your undivided attention,\" the General commanded. \"Millions have died today in the name of freedom. Jason, find some warm bodies at NASA. Call people at home if you have to. I need visuals on the Earth-Moon corridor now.\"\n\"People! Do let's send these charlatans back to hell, shall we? I have some hellfire for them. Yesterday we were the shining sword of the United States. Today we defend the entire Earth.\"\nGeneral Considene? This god bleeds. We're going to need to prep the Sapphire Group of ICBM's for near-launch. The chemical-pumped laser satellite payloads need ten minutes to initialize, but hold off on that until we get NASA online and know what is going on. Get on that now! Prep them for launch but await my launch orders.\"\n\"Sir, I have NASA!\" Jason shouted. \"Getting the information... Hold on... There's only a handful of them online. Others are being Priority 1 Paged or tracked down by military police. We should have a lot more at station in a half hour.\"\n\"Can they see anything happening around the moon?\", Artiken asked.\n\"Yes! They are showing fifteen craft. They are computing mass now based on their dead-stick trajectories. No, give us weight-we don't care about mass. Ok... It looks like they are averaging... 240 metric tons. They are dead-stick at about 140,000kph General.\nGeneral Artiken motioned to the others to join him in the War Room.\nOne advisor was babbling, \"Send up the Diamond Group too! Make a vertical wall of the nuclear-pumped lasers. That wall can stay in orbit for days before gravity pulls it down. If they climb up over the wall, they burn unexpected fuel. If they drift near a satellite, use the explosion like a landmine, but have the laser terra-pulse targeting a second ship!\"\n\"They are dead-sticking it,\" Considene noted. \"That tells me they were catapulted from a base on the far side. Also tells me their power is limited. They are saving it up for attack runs.\"\n\"Probably bomb us from high orbit,\" another advisor added.\n\"I'm going to say these are bombers. Slow-speed bombers. That is what their slow speed is like,\" added the airforce technical advisor.\nThe other brass was coming around to the magnitude of what had just been accomplished. They were pulling themselves together. Military communication lines still functioned and a dozen people manned phones to alert the nation's mostly-deserted military bases.\nChase's body cooled while slumped in the chair.\nArmageddon had indeed arrived.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Now, with the war and rationing, and with most able-bodied artists either serving at the front or producing patriotic tripe to keep up morale at home... Miriam shook her head in disgust.\n\"But, Madame!\" exclaimed the shaken young artist. \"No 'buts,' from you, mister, just get your butt out of here, and take these sorry cartoons with you!\" Miriam shouted. She had just returned from a brief sojourn in Albuquerque (searching for leather to patch the soles of her best shoes, if it must be said). In her absence, her manager, now ex-manager, had impulsively booked an exhibition of \"patriotic\" paintings by a young unknown, an amateur, a dabbler... She sputtered in anger at the thought.\nThe kid should be drawing for the funny papers, not sneaking into a place where grownups come to share art, culture and the finer things.\nMiriram glanced at the canvases again as the devastated teenage painter carried them out, one by one, to a taxi waiting by the door. A garish painting showed a begrimed and wounded soldier, rifle in hand, struggling to bar a cathedral door against hordes of ape-like enemies. Another work showed a religious scene in traditional New Mexico retablo style, reflected in a pool of blood. Disgusting.\nShe was glad when the artist finally carried out his last canvas, an impressionistic view of Saint Botolph urging the troops forward from above during the Second Battle of Boston. \"Iconoclasts! Filthy iconoclasts!\" shouted the weeping young artist, waving his fist out the taxi window as the vehicle slowly pulled away in a cloud of blue exhaust-smoke.\nMiriam slammed the glass door harder than she needed to, trying to shut out the stench of low-octane wartime gasoline. It was harder for her to shut out the intrusion that the young dilettante had made into her neat, orderly world of art and beauty.\n\"Madame, did you hear what they're saying?\" soothed a solicitous employee. Miriam sighed. \"Abstract Morozism is all the wave this year in Paris, and at the Hermitage in Moscow they're showing Moroze again. In Lisbon...\" Miriam waved the employee to silence. \"They think they're so avante-garde, imitating Moroze in abstract,\" she replied, her voice seething with scorn. \"They think they're so radical, so chic, so stylish. They even call themselves iconoclasts!\" she exclaimed, with a laugh that turned into tears. \"Iconoclasts!\" she muttered between sobs. The employee rushed to comfort her, but she waved him away. \"I need to get some fresh air,\" she mumbled, and then turned and left the Gallery.\nOutside, the scene looked little different from what it had been every day for the last few months. Virtually every man and most of the women Miriam passed in the street were in uniform. She recalled that when the mobilization first began she had marvelled at the crisp, starched appearance of the troops in their newly-issued uniforms. Now she saw that many of the uniforms were torn and stained, and too many of their wearers looked equally ill-treated. With a sniff, she noted and then chose to ignore the piles of uncollected garbage accumulating along the streets of her once-immaculate New Mexico capital city. Stepping carefully between the beggars, many in ragged uniforms or displaying their wounds, Miriam climbed the steps to the main entrance of the post office.\nThe postal clerk was a woman she didn't recognize. \"Where's Dan MacPhee?\" she asked, and the clerk looked at her uncomprehendingly. She asked again in Spanish, and the clerk nodded, and explained that \"el viejito\" had been called up for the National Guard while Miriam was out of town. \"But he's at least 60 years old,\" marvelled Miriam. The clerk waved her hand, and with an exhausted \"sepa Dios\" (God knows), turned her wheelchair to look for the Gallery's mail.\nSince the wartime manpower shortage took letter-carriers off the street, Miriam had come every few days to the Post Office to pick up the Gallery's mail. She had enjoyed chatting with MacPhee, an educated gentleman of old Scottish stock. He liked to discuss the color patterns used by the Navajo on their traditional blankets that were so much a part of the state's artistic heritage. Miriam tried to imagine him in uniform at the front, toting a rifle.\nThe new clerk wheeled her way back to the window and handed Miriam her correspondence. The latest copy of Pacific Art Review showed renaissance masterpieces from the San Francisco Museum of Art being crated for shipping to Australia \"for safe keeping.\" The magazine, if Miriam could call it that, was down to six pages, and was printed on what appeared to be some kind of evil-smelling newsprint. The ink smeared under Miriam's fingers, and she dropped the magazine and several letters into her bag. With a courteous \"Hasta luego,\" she left the Post Office and headed toward the Plaza.\nAs usual in Santa Fe, it was a clear, sunny day. Miriam could see a dense cloud of black smoke rising to the north of the city above the peaks of the mountains. Several passing soldiers noticed it as well, and picked up their pace, heading toward some unknown destination.\nMiriam chose a park-bench with a view of the Palace of the Governors, and carefully sat down to read her mail.\nThe first letter was a mimeographed notice that Art World magazine was suspending publication \"for the duration.\" Miriam shook her head. She remembered how, before the war, her articles in Art World and the west coast papers had defined the trends for visual and plastic arts in the Southwest. She could elevate a budding artist to prominence, or damn another to obscurity with a stroke of her pen. Now, what had things come to? Moroze in the Hermitage, traditional artistic values in the ashcan, and teenage fingerpainters calling her an iconoclast.\nMiriam looked up as a siren broke the relative silence of the morning. Several police motorcycles passed, and then a limo with the yellow-and-red State flag on the bumper. They were in a hurry. Behind the limo an armored bank truck joined the improvised motorcade, tires squealing as it pulled out of the driveway of the State Treasury Building. The parade turned south, evidently heading for Albuquerque. People were running from the State Government Complex. Miriam heard someone crying.\nAlarmed, she picked up her bag and headed for the Gallery. The sidewalks seemed emptier than when she came out, and anyone with a car and gasoline seemed to be heading south. The electric power was out again and the Gallery was dark when she reached the front door.\nWhen she got back to her office, her remaining employees were gathered around her radio. With a gasp, she noted that the valuable, art-deco battery radio was tuned to \"The Believers' Voice of Righteousness,\" the enemy's banned broadcasting station. She opened her mouth to order them to turn it off, but one of the employees \"shush-ed\" her to silence. She listened in stunned shock.\n\"...following United Nations resolution 13995, the historic old City of Santa Fe has been declared an open city, and our victorious armies have graciously agreed to preserve the city's architectural treasures out of respect for world public opinion. All residents of Santa Fe are warned to stay indoors and off the streets to allow our heroic units to take up their positions. Soldiers of the defeated forces must report by six p. m. tonight to the following concentration points...\"\nMiriam's head swam in confusion. \"Any resistance will be punished with the utmost severity!\" warned the gruff-voiced announcer. \"Remain in your homes. All public gatherings or demonstrations are prohibited. We come not as liberators, but as conquerors!\" The radio burst into a hoarse soldiers'-choir version of \"Rise Up, Ye Men of God,\" and Miriam shrank back in horror. Her employees excused themselves one by one, wanting to be with their families. She wordlessly let them go.\nIt was late afternoon when the army truck flying the violet flag pulled up before the Gallery and a smartly-dressed officer politely entered and introduced himself as \"Major Abraham, of the Armies of The Lord.\" \"You are the owner of this establishment?\" he asked.\nMiriam nodded wordlessly, and the Major waved in a squad of soldiers who quickly began an inspection of the gallery. \"Nothing but abstracts in here,\" barked one of the soldiers from a side room. \"Same here,\" shouted another from the gallery's main exhibition area. The Major was turning to leave when a young soldier gasped, and called \"Sir, come see this.\" He had found the gallery's collection of Santos.\nThe Major returned with a set jaw and confronted Miriam. \"Madame,\" he growled, \"have you never read the Word of God?\" He reached into his belt-pouch and pulled out a worn pocket-edition Bible. \"Read this passage aloud, if you please.\" he told Miriam. The small volume fell open to the page, and the words were circled: \"Thou shalt make unto thyself no graven images.\" Miriam read the verse with a steady voice.\nMajor Abraham looked Miriam in the eye and sighed. \"How long has that been the Commandment of God? And how long have we been fighting? Madame, I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you into custody for aggravated iconodulia and idolatry.\" He made a gesture to the soldiers and they began their work. As he was leading Miriam out, she heard the sound of tearing canvas, splintering wood and breaking glass. The Iconoclasts were smashing icons.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The people sitting, or attempting to sit, in the chairs around him seemed lost in unfamiliar bodies. The ones at the triage table struggled the most as they tried to make their symptoms understood. Even the ones who could speak had trouble describing problems with suddenly rebellious parts of their anatomy, or trying to explain the gaps in what they'd known the day before. Jason felt relieved. Even though he couldn't speak, the rest of his body still worked. The triage nurse had simply given him paper and a pen to write down his symptoms.\nJason resettled the bag with the bread and wine between his feet so he could stretch his legs out. He closed his eyes to block out the clinic and tried to relax. Helen was sure to be angry, since the whole mess had started out as a present for him. He'd had no idea what to expect when the package arrived unannounced at work, and he had only been able to guess what was on the disk until he got to the center. In the pleasant few hours between the arrival of the disk and his attempt to have the upgrade installed, it had even seemed to him that the corrosion that had overtaken so much of their marriage might actually be receding. But it seemed even their surprises for each other were prone to go awry.\nA nurse, who tapped him softly on the shoulder and pointed toward the clinic entrance, interrupted Jason's thoughts. Jason followed, glad for the moment that he couldn't exchange the usual empty greetings with the nurse, who looked tired anyway in his wrinkled scrubs.\nThe clinic was a large, open room with a mixture of gurneys and chairs for the patients and two small, curtained areas in a corner. It was chaotic and noisy, and private care was an impossibility. The nurse showed Jason to a chair. He smiled and said, \"I just need to check a few things for the doctor.\"\nThe nurse tipped Jason's head to the side, and hooked the diagnostic probe to the jack on his neck. \"I'll let that run, and the doctor will be along soon.\"\nThe probe was still a difficult sensation to get used to, and one Jason had never liked. It wasn't a wholly mental feeling, but didn't quite reach the threshold of the physical, either. More than anything, Jason always hated the thought that a machine could take an inventory of what was in his head. He was also savvy enough about the technology to know the machine could make assessments about him that he might not like to hear.\nA nearby patient yelling at one of the doctors caught Jason's attention. \"I paid damn good money to learn Spanish!\" the patient snapped. \"Before the upgrade I could shop in Tijuana by myself, now I don't even know how to say Yes to a margarita!\"\n\"Si,\" said the doctor, as if speaking to a child.\n\"See what?\" bellowed the patient.\n\"No, not 'see',\" said the doctor. \"'Si' is Spanish for 'yes'.\"\n\"I knew that this morning!\" bellowed the patient as his face reddened. \"Now fix me up or I'll forget how to read the bill you're running up.\"\nThe doctor, who couldn't be much older than his late twenties, hesitated and adjusted his glasses. \"Sir, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do. The upgrade didn't take, and it erased your previous knowledge of Spanish.\"\nThe patient half rose from his chair. \"What the hell does that mean. The upgrade is the best on the market. The President used it for the trade talks.\"\nThe doctor fidgeted and looked around the room, perhaps hoping for an older doctor. \"You don't have the capacity for the upgrade,\" he said.\nThe patient purpled with rage. \"Are you saying I'm stupid?\"\nThe doctor put his clipboard aside and said, \"Sir, we ran the probe three times to be sure. You don't have the capacity to fully speak a second language. Your previous knowledge of Spanish was probably all you could expect to achieve. Perhaps with augmentation patches when you were younger...\"\n\"Too old to learn Spanish? Is that what you think? Get an older doctor out here, I want a second opinion.\" He crossed his arms and glowered.\n\"A senior staff member looked at the charts with me. He'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you.\"\n\"Fine!\" snapped the patient. He grabbed at the cable coming out of his head and pulled.\nThe doctor's clipboard rattled to the floor as he grabbed at the patient's hands. \"Sir, I'll get that!\"\n\"Get off of me!\" The patient had succeeded in removing the cable, and he stuck the end in the pocket of the younger man's coat. \"Take it! You quacks invent this crap, then shove it out onto the market before it's ready, and look at this,\" he bellowed, staring around the crowded room. \"We were better off without it. I'm a salesman, damn it, and half my customers speak Spanish. You just killed my career.\"\n\"Sir, it's not our upgr...\".\n\"I know, I know... not our upgrade, not our upgrade, not our upgrade. Is that the only thing they teach in med school? Just give me the damn bill and I'm gone.\"\nJason was glad to have a new doctor walk over and shake his hand, blocking his view of the raging salesman. \"So,\" she said, smiling, \"upgrade got your tongue?\" She looked down at his chart. \"Let me see, the wrong disk went into the machine. And of course, you go blank during the upgrade and don't know what's riding the input.\"\nJason smiled and nodded back, but his own anxiety was returning. The clerk at the center had done a backup before the procedure. But then again, he had used the wrong disk for the upgrade, so there was no guarantee the backup was right.\nThe doctor pulled the readout off the scanner, then looked at Jason and said, \"Try counting out loud to three.\"\nJason tried, but could only manage a guttural clicking.\nThe doctor gently put her hand to the front of Jason's throat. \"Hum, please,\" she said. \"Say 'aahh'.\"\nThis brought the same result as the attempt to count, and Jason gave up. The doctor drew her hand back and scribbled some quick notes on Jason's chart. \"So your wife was going to make you a singer.\"\nJason motioned toward her clipboard, which she handed to him along with her pen. Jason wrote, \"A gift. Always wanted to sing. Oops!\"\nShe read the message and smiled again. \"So instead the clerk tried to make you a great orator. Oh well.\"\nJason scribbled again. \"If it worked, I'd be the next president!\"\nThe doctor seemed to appreciate the irony. Taking her clipboard back, she said, \"Well, let's see if we can at least get you singing in the shower again. I'll be right back.\"\nThe doctor's nonchalance was reassuring, but Jason still worried. He felt fairly confident he would get his speech back, but restoration procedures could be costly, and sitting next to the salesman with the Spanish problem hadn't helped his mood.\nThe doctor returned fairly quickly carrying a speech synthesizer. With a sheepish grin she held it up and hit the play button. A surprisingly machine-like but definitely female voice said, \"I cannot speak. Let me write it down.\"\nJason shook his head and the doctor laughed. \"It's the best I can lay my hands on at the moment. But the good news is that you won't be using it for long. We can't do the restorative procedure today, but I scheduled you for early tomorrow morning. I assume you're anxious to get it fixed, and this way you'll be talking again for work on Monday.\"\nJason took the synthesizer and grinned, hitting the button to hear the message again. He nodded his head in place of a thank you.\n\"You're lucky,\" said the doctor. \"There appears to be no loss of memory or knowledge. It's so minor we won't even use the backup patterns. It's just an input-output problem. When you come in tomorrow, we'll attach another probe, and administer a small shock... Don't worry, we haven't done that for a long time... and afterward you should be back to normal. The old-timers call it a reboot.\n\"And, please,\" the doctor put a hand on Jason's arm, \"next time, go to a doctor for an upgrade. There are reasons,\" she added, gesturing to the crowd of patients and personnel packing the room, \"why we fought so hard to require prescriptions for upgrades. A data dump is one thing,\" she said, making a knowing gesture to the jack on the back of her own neck, \"but an upgrade is another thing entirely.\"\nJason nodded like a child getting a good-natured scolding. She was, no doubt, right. The upgrades were billed as being more or less automatic, but once one started, the results were unpredictable. Technically you could even do an upgrade on a home player, but few people felt comfortable enough with the technology to do that yet.\nAfter Jason left the clinic, the anonymity of the subway made it unlikely he would need to use the speech synthesizer on his way home, which was just as well. The stress of the day was beginning to exert itself. He didn't feel up to communicating anything longhand with pen and paper.\nJason grimaced. His short trip on his lunch hour to buy the makings of dinner and have the upgrade installed had turned into a long, unpleasant afternoon, and the evening promised to be little better. On the way to the upgrade center, he had even mulled over the songs he could sing that night, hoping a serenade of Helen would make the perfect ending to a candlelit dinner. But as usual, things with Helen had a way of turning themselves around quickly, and usually, badly. She would roll her eyes and sigh. She would probably say it was the clerk's fault, but her eyes would be accusatory, \"Why didn't you go someplace good to have it installed? Why didn't you watch what the guy was doing? You always do this.\"\nIt would be less a fight than another missed opportunity. Jason had expected something from Helen, but not a gift or anything romantic. In truth, he had half-expected her to ask for a divorce, and that was a possibility he dreaded. In the end, of course, he'd say yes, but not without negotiation. The prenuptials had been written when Helen was still in school, two jobs and a couple of promotions ago.\nJason also had no stomach for the social fallout from a divorce. Helen cut a good figure at his side, and the senior partners liked associates with stable lives. Personal disruptions were viewed with suspicion.\nJason smiled to himself again. Being unable to speak presented a more immediate concern than his marital problems. Great, he thought. The firm may upgrade to a new associate if this isn't fixed tomorrow.\nOn his way out of the station, Jason threw the bread and wine in the trash. A stiffer drink was definitely in order.\nJason reached home before Helen. He went into his study and dropped into the old chair, kicking his shoes off and stretching. The thought crossed his mind to get the drink he'd promised himself, but he let his eyes close as he slouched further into the chair. Time enough for a drink when Helen arrived.\nIt didn't take long. Jason heard the familiar sounds of the door opening, the pumps being kicked off, the coat being thrown over the sofa. He started to call out to her, then remembered he couldn't. He decided to wait for her to come up to change her clothes before he broke the news.\nAs Jason waited, he heard a voice that wasn't Helen's. It was definitely masculine, but Jason couldn't make out any words. He sat up a little more in the chair as he heard Helen's voice. \"Jason?\"\n\"I told you he wouldn't be here,\" said the man's voice. It was definitely unfamiliar to Jason.\n\"I know,\" Helen's voice came back. \"But I really want to finish this. It's taken too long.\"\n\"I'm telling you, it's done by now.\" Jason could hear the man's voice in the living room directly below the landing. \"There's no way he'd make it home. He probably didn't make it out of the center. He's probably on the sidewalk, or, by now, he's...\"\n\"I don't need the details,\" said Helen. \"Look, there's no message on the console. You said to expect one.\"\n\"It'll come, don't worry.\"\n\"Maybe I should try to call him at work. Tell them I'm worried.\" The note of hesitation in her voice surprised Jason.\n\"No,\" the man said. \"This late on Friday afternoon, nobody will be there anyway. Don't worry, the call will come.\"\nJason rose softly from his chair and stood near the door where he could see most of the living room. Helen sat perched on the edge of the sofa, and to Jason's surprise, she pulled a cigarette out and lit it. It had been a long time since she'd done that in the house. She knew he hated it. Jason waited where he was, in the shadows of the study.\nA moment later a man, who must have been the one Jason heard, threw himself on the couch next to her and pointed to the cigarette. \"Looks like I'm not the only one who thinks Jason's not coming home.\"\nJason stepped back a little farther in the study, but stayed where he could see Helen and her companion.\nHelen laughed, but looked at him and said, \"Be quiet. We don't really know how this will go yet.\"\n\"It's guaranteed...\" he started.\n\"Rick...\" interrupted Helen.\n\"Look,\" he went on. \"This dealer was the best. He's been making viruses for years. Besides, the centers never check the disks. They plug you in, start the upgrade, and bang. Jason probably never knew what hit him. The first time he went to sing, or even speak with that wonderful new voice you got him...\" Helen laughed. \"...out like a light. If he didn't have ID with him, they're probably still trying to figure who the stiff is.\"\nJason was dizzy with that last statement. He looked back at his desk where he'd put the disk. The phone was next to it, and Jason measured the distance, wondering if he could make it and dial the police without being heard. Dial the police. And say what? he thought. He just stood, hoping the shadows were dark enough to hide him. Very slowly, as if even turning his head would be loud enough to give him away, Jason looked back into the living room.\nHelen had turned a little on the sofa, and the stranger, Rick, she'd called him, was rubbing her shoulders.\nRick leaned close to Helen's ear, and loud enough for Jason to overhear, said, \"In a few weeks, the mourning widow will need to get away. Why don't you plug in again, and take a look at those sandy beaches. I'll be serving you umbrella drinks seaside.\"\nHe laughed and slid a disk out of his pocket, putting it into the player on the table. But as he reached with the wire towards Helen's neck, she shook off his other hand and rose from the sofa. \"I'll look at it later, but for now, I need to get you out of here. In case.\"\n\"As you wish,\" retorted Rick, closing the player's door on the disk. \"But there's nothing to worry about.\"\nHelen turned back to Rick with an expression Jason had known well early in their romance. Partly peeved, but mostly affectionate. \"The bereaved widow will soothe herself to sleep with thoughts of the Caribbean,\" she said. She stepped over next to Rick and bent to give him a slow kiss. \"The first thing when I get back, I'll plug in and think about those drinks. But let's go.\"\nShe moved into the kitchen, and Jason could here her running water, probably to snuff the cigarette. He felt nauseous. At the moment, the worst of it was thinking about Helen coming back after taking Rick wherever she needed to, and waiting in the empty apartment for the phone to ring. He could imagine her coming in, looking for a message, then plugging in and hitting Play.\nRick got up from the sofa and walked to the door. \"It ends tonight,\" he said.\nFor the first couple of minutes after they left, Jason just stood in the deepening shadow, feeling naked and invisible. Then he slowly made his way down the stairs to the living room. He stood, staring at the player on the table. Rain had begun falling outside, and the water on the window bent the light from the street, throwing shifting waves across the room.\nJason stood like that for a while longer. When he reached down to take the disk out of the player, it felt entirely natural. He slid it into his pocket and went back up to his study. He took the upgrade disk from where he'd left it on the desk and returned to the living room. Under the sound of the rain falling outside, his footsteps were silent as he made his way across the room. He slid the upgrade disk into the player, and clicked the lid shut. He made sure the container for the brochure disk remained on the table next to the player. When Helen arrived home and found no messages, she would need something to calm her nerves. He could imagine her plugging in, leaning back, and letting the disk run. When it was done, he would just walk into the room. He knew she'd have to say something, and as soon as she tried to speak it would be over.\nJason went back up to the study, and plugged in to the brochure. Rick was right. It was soothing to let the room swim out of focus and morph into a sunny beach with cabanas strung along the edge of the sand. The people imported into the scene were predictably good-looking: the women slim-waisted and buxom, the men muscular, tall, and tan. No worry lines on any of those faces.\nJason was sorry he had to keep an ear out for Helen's arrival. The beach scene pulled at him with a relaxed urgency he began to feel through his whole body. But there would be time later to savor it completely, and in person. Yes, he thought, upgrades are a good thing.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Apparently, the early explorers had seen a future with the special resources of the hydrocarbon marshes and shallow seas that Titan had to offer...\"\n\"Back again to the question: Why the interest in a gloomy moon? - It had perpetual darkness, under which nitrogen storms and propane sleet raged mercilessly in 20 yr. long 'summers' of fiery methane. Its calm ethane lakes and amino acid slush lagoons had fascinated countless score of human colonists for generations. The reason had nothing to do with the mineral wealth of the world...\"\n\"The fascination lies with the natural lifeforms abound in Titans nutrient-rich shallow seas. Its slush lagoons bathe a whole spectrum of viral oddities with their strange helix coils, luminescence colony organisms and superstructure coral reefs. Titan's life has an alien beauty, and a fantastic glow of what life can become...\"\n\"Nature is a wondrous thing...\"\n\"The colonists on Titan are divided into two groups: the humans who ply the mineral\/chemical wealth from the ethane sea floors, and have not chosen to be genetically altered. Then there are the 'Astartian satyrs,' who have chosen genetic evolution by their union with the semi-sentient coral organisms on Titan. These native life forms are called the Lucifumes, and they have allowed the Astartian satyrs to evolve to the point where they no longer need protective spacesuits to survive in the 'special' 20 year long 'summers' on Titan.\n\"Such is the satyricon joy for Titan that they harbor a secret...\"\n\"There is a native intelligent alien species on this dark moon...\"\n\"They are simply called the Titans, and while their technological status as an intelligent species is 'stone age,' their cognitive mental abilities have much to teach our latent mental skills. Not much is known about this strange alien species, except by maybe a few specially chosen savants of the Astartian satyrs. The existence of the Titans is a well kept secret...\"\n\"I do know one exemplary thing:\"\n\"The native intelligent aliens of Titan frequently use their advanced telepathic abilities to send siren calls across the cerebral radio waves of 'conscious' Deep Heaven...\"\n\"They use these telepathic siren calls to look for the incredible- a cross-species mate. The Astartian satyrs believe that the Titans have done this for millennium, possibly having even furthered their own biological evolution by breeding with unknown alien extraterrestrial species who may have traveled through our Solar System eons ago...\"\n\"Its been compared to 'life dreaming itself into being'...\"\nPere-Sephon then made a special point to her story:\n\"Traveling over Titan, on my last journey in the Agamennon, I felt the siren call of a Titan inside my soul, aimed purposely at me...\"\n\"Enraptured, I parked the Agamennon in orbit above Titan, and descended to the surface...\"\n\"I was enraptured...\"\nPere-Sephon recounted her descent to the surface of the gloomy, shadow world of Titan, where she journeyed into the cold ethane seas. Beneath the hydrocarbon ice and slush, there had been a special cavern. Here a simple temple mount had been, where Astartian satyrs practiced mental magic and mercurial mathematics. It was from this spot that the siren call of the intelligent Titan that had enraptured Pere-Sephon became stronger and stronger, until it seemed the frequency would match the frequency of her heart, - and she would explode.\nSoon enough, in the hollow tomb of the cavern, the nitrogen darkness gave away to the luminescence of the Lucifume coral organisms. Pere-Sephon did not need to see the Titan,--she knew it was there, watching her. The sexual call forced her to match it with her own siren wail. She successfully matched it by speeding up her heartbeat, and time slowed to an ethane crawl.\nThe Consummation of the Species thus began.\nAn ecstasy of the millenniums cascaded upon Pere-Sephon. All of the different species of extra-terrestrial races that the Titan's had consummated with in their lifetimes gave birth to a climax of knowledge of the universal consciousness...\n...of the ALL-FLESH.\nSuddenly it ended, and Pere-Sephon had left the cold nitrogen cavern shaking with coital heat, and partial amnesia. She looked behind her, and saw the glyphic life-glow of her spiritual-blood child, cocooned inside the parental womb of the surrogate Lucifume coral organisms. For a second she had looked upon the face of her very own soul, and then, she could take no more.\nIt was a joy of loss she would remember forever.\nFondly.\nPere-Sephon ended the first part of her story.\n\"I returned to the Agamennon, and the womb of outer space. The ram collider accelerated the tachyons inside the real-time history reality of the ship, and my own body. I rode the planar of possible histories, while years passed in real-time, and age matched it's own velocity. But I hardly noticed...\"\n\"I was in communion with Deep Heaven, in its planar valleys, and above its spiked possibilities. I enjoyed the slow time of oblivion and the eternity of nothingness...\"\n\"My ship and I, with our message for the Earth, had our obliterated non-existence flung towards the 'king of the planets'...\"\n\"Jupiter...\"\nUpon approaching the first groups of natural satellites of Jupiter, known as the Trojan Asteroids, Pere-Sephon had encountered devastated world-let after world-let. Whole colonies had seemingly been exterminated with no significant clue as to 'Why?' other than the excess of wielding the wand to extinguish human life.\nThe microsystem of Jupiter's orbiting worldlets, both the Greek and Trojan Kampers, worlds no bigger than a mile, had been in the throes of a holocaust.\nPere-sephon's reassembled tachyon real-time personality was then able to understand who was directing this holocaust.\nIt was Callisto, first in the order of the four moons of Jupiter that made up the Galilean satellites, worlds that were the size of Mercury and Pluto. This made the Galilean satellites planets in their own right, and ever since the last days of the Great Partition, these worlds of Jupiter had held considerable power throughout the domains of the Solar System.\nCallisto, harbinger of the holocaust on the Trojan Asteroids, came into view of the Agamennon. It was a world with the color of deep-black soot, almost blending in with the blackness of outer space, if not for the visible gray blast craters of eons of meteorite bombardments upon the icy-rock surface of primordial Callisto. On the carbonaceous, cratered surface, Pere-Sephon had been able to see the civilization that lived on Callisto, who visibly, was a highly industrious presence. Their highly developed outposts of civilization stood like Romanesque daggers of light on the blast-worn surface of the Gallilean moon.\nPere-Sephon had been confused by this strange society, for she had never seen before. She tuned into the super-intelligence, trans\/wave interfaces that connected all of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, and quickly understood the reality that had happened while she had been in faster-than-light space travel.\nA secret migration had happened from the planet Earth. It was called the Secret Declension.\nThe new rulers of Callisto, in their crude towers of light, were the Uta-Ute Bastion of His Glory, Mormon dissenters from the Earth kingdom called Deseret. They were ruled by a devil of a man; the Archduke Ves Calabus.\nThe worldlets of the Trojan and Greek Kampers that were being obliterated by the Archdukes fleet ships had another name for him:\nThe Mad Duke of Callisto.\nScorched human bodies littered the cold vacuum of space nearby Callisto. The Archduke was busy cleansing away the people of the Trojan Asteroids who followed the old beliefs of the vanished Commonrealm of Nations. The Archduke was killing in the name of his god.\nThe Many-Faces-Of-God were being destroyed by the One-Face-Of-Hate.\nIt was at this moment, that the tale of Pere-Sephon began to change its mood. It became sad.\n\"The same story that I saw in Callisto-space held up for the second of the Galilean satellites that I encountered; Ganymede. The rulers of that moon were busy engaged in sending fleets of dropfire bombships upon the one other of the weak group of worldlets around Jupiter, which were called the Minors...\"\n\"Ganymede was largely an ice world, but its size and proximity to Jupiter's massive gravity pull made it a place of geologic upheaval. Hot geysers of molten metal from the world's hot core fissured forth into cold space, and recovered the surface of this glacial world. This process created a jagged, free-floating tectonic plate; a continent of tortured-looking alpine mountains. This was the only solid land on a world largely made out of primordial ice that dated back to the creation of the Solar System...\"\n\"The rulers of Ganymede were the Five Medean Princedoms. They controlled medieval fiefs on the tectonic continent of glacial Ganymede. The castles were home to of each of the Five Cloned Princes, genetically designed by the Charlemagne Breeding Matrix. They had arrived upon Ganymede as part of the Secret Declension from the planet Earth, and were the disappointed family line of the Earth's Von Strauven Emperors, who had ousted from the imperial throne by the House of Hirohito during the 'War of the Assassins.'\n\"The terms of the Great Partition had been scrapped...\"\nPere-Sephon now saw that the rumors she had seen in the Doppler shifts of Deep Heaven were true. Europa, the third of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, was indeed the richest world in the Solar System.\nAnd the most beautiful.\nBut it was not without its own conflict.\nThis ice wreathed world, with its global oceans protected by a kilometer thick billiard-ball shield of smooth ice, glowed with the mysterious light of a powerful human presence.\nThis human presence was the Matriachautte of Europa, the all-woman hierarchy who ruled this glittering pearl of a world. They had lived on Europa ever since the first waves of the Secret Declension had started in 2882, when their ancestors, the legendary Seattle Contingency, and their hopeful World-Queen, had been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Rainier on the planet Earth.\nThe devastated women survivors had used the last of their wealth and power to secretly leave the planet Earth, and colonize the beautiful world of Europa.\nThe success of the Matriachautte had come only at the terms of the Matriachautte - and Europa...\nNo cities had been built on the surface of the frozen ocean world. Even if cities would have been allowed, it would have been impossible. Europa had no visible landmasses of any kind that protruded through the glacial shield that covered Europa's global ocean. So being, only one major spaceport had been built on the surface and it was only permitted on a floating glacier. In like-minded spirit of protecting Europa's environment, there was a giant floating palace and city, home court to the princesses and duchesses of the Matriachautte, levitated on pillars of pure thought.\nEuropa was a world devoid of spoilage.\nPere-Sephon asked a question in her story:\n\"Why did the Matriachautte's insist on strict environmental control of Europa? Why were the tyrannical defenses set up to repel any molestation of the waters of their planet?\"\n\"It was because they were guarding a secret.\"\n\"Underneath the protective ice, there was an oasis of deep sea life. Primitive exoskeleton vertabraed creatures lived near the warm sea vents, and made sustenance off of the rich nutrient chemicals that spilled forth from the violent interior of the world. These colonies existed in the deep volcanic sea trenches, vulnerable to the least bit of a geologic change, which might cease a geological sulphur-rich geyser from spitting out its precious heat and chemicals, thus killing the organisms that relied so much on Europa's precious interior resources.\"\n\"If these primitive trilobites could talk, they'd tell you about the real wealth of Europa: the planets ability to give them existence. So inspiring was Europa's life forms, and the ability for them to thrive in quiet, dark beauty beneath the protective ice, shielding them from the deadly, airless vacuum, that a special relationship had been formed between the native lifeforms and the Matriachautte. A relationship of identification and similarities.\"\n\"The Matriachautte of Europa was fiercely proud of the native life of Europa's oceans, which they attempted to keep as a preserve for eternity\"\n\"They had a word for their defense:\"\n\"'Boudicia'\"\n\"Never again would a world be raped.\"\nPere-Sephon and her spaceship, the Agamennon, next encountered the last of Jupiter's Galilean satellites. This was Io, fire world, where sulphur seas of molten fire continually dissolved the crust of the world, and great streams of fire ripped out from horrific volcanoes. These volatile surface conditions ionized the cold vacuum of space overhead, and a magnetic aurora was formed of blue, red and green trace atmospheres.\nThis atmospheric condition was called the Pandemonium Effect, and Jupiter hung through the molten temperature haze in diverse images, each a hallucigenia of 'sundogs,' or in this case 'jovian dogs.'\nZhenghe the Awesome had called this sight the 'God Days of Summer.'\nThe super-intelligent trans\/wave that connected all the interfaces of the worlds of Jupiter had this to say about Io, the fireworld.\nIt was the wildcard.\nPere-Sephon saw why this was the case.\nOn the surface of the molten world, between the fiery sulphur area called the Great Promethean Sea, and a large sulphur desert known as Catrell's Devil Den, Pere-Sephon, the space traveler from the cold planet of Pluto-Charon, saw a gargantuan city that walked on four legs between the environmental cataclysms on the surface. What exactly it was was harder to understand in simple terms.\nPere-Sephon tried to explain this strange 'walking city' as an industrial\/super computer, base to a metropolis of robots.\nAnd other experiments.\nIt was specifically known as an 'organicon-artificial intelligence hive' and an honorable member of the Notable Corporate Fiefs of Jupiter. The name of it was the ROMAN AIIO, the uncontested ruler of this fireworld. To survive on fiery Io, it shifted its giant movable quarters onto the quick-form sulphur beaches of the molten fire rivers. Above these anthropomorphic hind legs, themselves each an artificial intelligence 'female' receptor terminal, there was the 'Brain' of the walking metropolis alive with robots.\nAll operations of the organicon artificial intelligence hive were controlled from two sources.\nThe Triple Primary Color Codex, the language bank of all male receptor data became a silicon-RNA showroom of possible brain formations. It was concerned with all procreative functions of pure thought and action. Here the hives of computer intelligence were put into strategic computing powers of infinite processing attention. With each real timeline worked out, assemblages according to color combinations of the Triple Primary Color Codex were lived out through the think-tank reservoir's personalities making up the second silicon-RNA showroom.\nThis was the Vulgate Keep, the posterior artificial intelligence hive.\nWhere computers dreamed.\nIn the frugal and chaste department-hives in the process of something called 'mock drop kick,' which was basically electro-magnetic-pulse simulations that made the computers 'crash' all their functions, split decisions of pure intuition were created by an organicon simulation virus. The cyber-personality known as the ROMAN AIIO was created in between the gaps of fast-time and 'abort, retry, fail.'\nPere-Sephone went into her superintelligence-interface, and rode shockwaves the datumquakes of crashing interfaces that were failing over and over again. She was doing this to communicate with the ROMAN AIIO, which she easily could have done by flying her drop-pod down to the 'walking supercity.' She chose not to because of the datumwaves of information she had seen of the ROMAN AIIO's military defenses, principally her concern, the genetically altered humanoid army of 'the Saurians.' With their reptilian cortex brain functions giving them a DNA-spliced quasi-kinship to extinct Earth dinosaurs, and their impervious gene tailoring that made it possible for them to fight in the cold, airless vacuum of outer space, Pere-Sephone had great reservations to meet these bizarre alterations of nature.\nThey scared her.\nInstead she went along and rode a user-friendly datumcolumn personality. Only once inside she realized where she was, and who she was communicating with. It was not the main artificial intelligence hive of the ROMAN AIIO.\nIt was a human boy, 5 or 6 years of age, that asked Pere-Sephone in a curious human voice 'why he had been cloned.'\nShe had met the Little Prince of Io, and he had much to say.\nPere-Sephone tried earnestly to explain the vast changes that the Little Prince of Io had told her would soon envelop humanity. She tried to give some sense to the eerie vision that the Little Prince had showed her.\nIt was the very vision of her own spirit at the moment of her death.\nPere-Sephon also tried to explain the other vision she had been granted, and one far stranger than her own spirit in the moments after her death.\nIt had been the vision of four people, whom she had never seen before, in a land she had never seen to before, either. The vision of the four strangers revealed the origin of them to be on the planet Earth. They had not been born yet, but soon would be, at the very same moment when she died on the only world she had never been to in the entire Solar System.\nThe planet Earth.\nThe Little Prince of Io had told Pere-Sephon that her death was tied to their births, and her imminent death on the Earth would initiate their own destinies to begin. She would live again as a great tale, that would spread across the lands of the strangest planet she could imagine, the Earth.\nHer death would precede their lives.\nThe Little Prince of Io had said one more thing to Pere-Sephon.\nAt the end there is a beginning.\nAnd then he was gone.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The race of beings you used to call wizards and myself, Oracle the last of that creed. Although my survival has been long and bland, this is an explanation of how in the space of a few short centuries man's memories of wizards have been long forgotten, abandoned amongst his legends to time as myths of fantasy. That loss has produced frustrations so deep that my moods have completely submerged, and the resolve to convey my thoughts seems an agony and nearly too painfully offensive for this chronicle to continue. How I often crave like a never ending deprivation that long absent opportunities could still be here, and as I sit and languish nothing seems to accommodate and I just grieve. These lands in this narrative are now dark and murky, the mountains, the trees and sea are no more pleasantries, and to ease the sorrow my mind's wonderings always drift to days before, to ancient excursions on innocent beaches and to all the eternities I've endured and the dominions that I have visited. Today as these realms of once great earth have declined into a siege of gloomy dismal streams what I once loved has disappeared, exhausted to leave a vestige of forlorn vitality. Apathetic skies are now far too contaminated to withhold, they have collapsed with my desire to correspond and be proud. However, the history of the wizards will at last be expressed as the requiem to a lost race.\nBorn to this earth like you, l existed when the dinosaurs walked this planet's soil, watched through their ultimate extinction and onwards to the elevation of the mammals. Finally culminating with the arrival of mankind, a being, whose adoration of us was our finest hour, but whose cynical and corrupting nature one main element in our ultimate dissolution. Once we were believed to be the gods of Olympus and the deities of Egypt, now men worship their supermarkets and television. We his former symbols of power never had to evolve, never had any family heritage, simply when conditions were appropriate we were conceived spontaneously.\nI was born in the great age of giant dinosaurs as a ball of naive consciousness, located by my old mentor, Solitaire, a nurturer who showed me the wonders of the existence as a wizard, the power to transform myself into any living creature or inanimate ambition. A might and sheer will to create whatever my mind perceived. Our ability to wield earths equilibrium and wonder from the creation of life have allowed ourselves the ability to turn creative energy to the use of wizardry. Humans may be more logical and their quest for understanding has amazed us. We simply are without the imagination or curiosity to have the ability to be scientifically analytical. But they have failed to understand one force of the cosmos, gravity and the purity of nature. It is not anything that could be measured by instruments or gauges, the ability to see the powers of universal equilibrium is the ability that only we possess. It is the secret of our power we are produced when cohesive forces are channelled into localized areas which when concentrated form to produce a wizard. These streams of power channelled into such a concentration, a sphere of awareness was formed, me, eternal wizard Oracle.\nSolitaire was the original and was here before the sun was formed, existed to see the first slime that appeared in the sea and primitive fish tentatively crawl onto the land. Solitaire was the first and l was the last and when l appeared there existed only seven in our eternity. Our power was strongest when the suns or the moon's energy could be appreciated. So for eons we chased our dreams and created a utopia of reveries. Everything on earth seemed to be made of the mystic fire from which we were created, then everything exuded obstinate energy and the bursts of creation like concerts in the balance of power. Allowed us to frolic with the universes own magical field and created a belief that we could be like our earth and exist till its final hour.\nAlthough even then ominous forces were evident and in the night skies vast lit areas were disappearing, swallowed from the heavens, and if we were worried it did not perturb, we were omnipotent and our power would forestall all in the universe. How naive to believe that nothing could harm us or shake our arrogant belief in ourselves, we were all powerful and totally without trepidation. But as the menace grew nearer, we debated what it could mean and all our experience could not have prepared us for what appeared. But when it did those millions of years ago, I still feel disgust at the sight of that earliest creature, our exact opposites we decided to brand repulsively as trolls.\nAlthough the warnings were there and plants and animals were appearing that did not exude the magic energy they were drab and black and felt poisonous to touch. Vast areas of mystic energies were turning to a night time desert of bad dreams, evolution had stopped and animals just seemed to disappear. Into this came the first troll, simple but ugly, dumb and cold. It seems we were formed from a concentration of a spent balance of the universe's creative energy he appeared from the destructive void and chaos. Unable to destroy we dispatched to the heavens and as the chaotic forces that held him together weakened he just modestly disappeared. What fools we were that our opposite creation could so easily be extinguished. We were no theologians and considered it a by-product of the creation of living beings and resolved never to create our pets for distraction again. Solitaire reasoned if we create magic beings the universe would create a being of ugliness to balance the scene. So our pet dragons and griffins started to disintegrate as all magic does if not conscientiously used and loved. I can still remember Solitaire on my last visit to China when his once majestic dragons, their scales loose and falling about them, their fiery breath extinguished, with neither any strength nor any resolve. Till today no trace of our magical efforts remain corroded away with lack of use.\nTrolls seemed to appear more often than what logic deemed they should, never with any power and never with any awareness but a lumbering aloofness that made them easily dispatched to the cosmos. Back to the cosmos we hoped to warn their fellow beings to stay where they should not be. Our world was dying and the spectrum of equilibrium and the forces of pure nature were disappearing. The colours of the lands were changing, the old species of plants and animals were still vibrant and grand, but all the newest evolved species were ashen and bland. Into an area of this total desolation he came, I still remember the sheer horror when l first saw him, instead of huge colourless beasts, this was new and instantly behind those dark piercing eyes we knew he was a threat that would eventually grow to menace us. Previous trolls were large grey amorphous characterisations of badly conceived plans, this new being was darker and his form although precise in dimensions, his face was angular sharp and human to command. The look of awareness and ability to perceive showed us our menace would one day rival our powers and eventually defeat and replace us. We were correct and our passion for dispatching his ugly underdeveloped brothers was pointless, we discovered what we were destroying where only unstable and primitive manifestations of our opposite selves that eventually disappeared by themselves. The new creatures although we had seen but one were the forerunners of beings as powerful and eternal as ourselves, drawing their power from places that are a land of waste to us. What fools we were dispatching trolls too whatever made them, the energy we fed on was dwindling what was left apart from vestiges in special still ancient coloured plants were the power of chaos available only to them. We fed on the mystery of creation these trolls survived by the forces of destruction.\nTenchard was the first wizard to go, caught in their area of ashen magical bareness and with his weak fields of energy. He was easy prey simple sent to the heavens till his weakening gravity of power could no longer be held and he simply evaporated in a flash of energy. We are creations of pure energy and he dissolved back to the elements that created him. My friend of eternity was gone washed into the fabrics of the universe, and complete depression and doom followed. Our world was failing, no more could be a single area supply enough power for more than one wizard, we broke apart and drifted to areas where we still had some influence. China was a popular choice where mystic energy was still strong and even enlightened humans with some awareness of primitive powers could harness some supernatural understanding. I went to the island known as Australia, Solitaire could not contend and aiming himself to the stars turned himself into pure light and hurtled himself to the still brilliant parts of the heavens and disappeared forever. That left but five and we knew that one day we too would also take the journey to follow. Still l considered if I was captured l could find time to convert myself into light and escape like my eternal friend Solitaire, however the doubt of a being who has lived forever and always thought he would, produced in me a desire not to take that chance. My essence is energy, matter is our might, to alter my energy and change to light is probably the demise of me.\nSo l turned my powers off and became a human, eventually no option, the mystic hue that surrounded me faded till l was indistinguishable from others and the now darkened polluted land around me. It offered no creative energy to cast my enchantments, and l walk about the world in the body of a man. Now depression haunts me my sun is not always there and noises of the night bring fears of dread that l may have been found. Today in the subway home l saw them with business suits and briefcases, three of them black and oppressively hugging the darkest edges of the underground at least the rays from my beloved sun still cause them to cling to those artificial caves of my fright. These trolls were no lumbering beasts but as human and aware as l ever could be, and either one far more powerful than l for almost an eternity has been. So I escaped to my retreat and sat and trembled, scared that l might have been recognized. Once we were seen as gods of Olympus replaced with trollish gods in form of enterprise polluting and despoiling our once perfect paradise.\nMy existence is now totally depressing as all the colours of my youth have gone and I but see as a primitive human photograph only black upon white. No more felt the living mosaic of magic forces, no more the thrill of creating a utopia, reduced to living entertained by human amusements television, radio and dreams of when my life's enthusiasm was enjoyable. Depression is absolute, how l wish l could again see my old friends and mentor Solitaire, wish we could still sit and bask in our ideal dreams, like a man who is homesick as a man who has lost everything my fear of using my limited powers has desolated me. Maybe we should have stood and fought, we could have sent many a troll to an eternity of non existence, maybe the forces that created me could again give me another start on some distant star galaxies away. What happens to the energy that made me it does not die l could again be Oracle. Trouble is human religions have never interested me, we don't have their determination or resolve for belief, even dragons were only the result of their dreams and ideas. I have seen all manners of creatures, especially men fight to survive and know the outcome is inevitable, they always die, so would have been our existence. I often wonder that in some place on earth my fellow wizards are surviving better than I, but that is a dream and from watching human television no magic is left to be seen. I can no longer survive as in this guise of a human l get no pleasure, no joy of food, no thrill of sex, what man has as activities of interest don't apply to me. An eternity in this shell, by existing as a parody from fear and doom. The trolls are no more worried by us, and they have systematically deforested our magical places under the camouflage of progress and development. Lands that were special have now turned to a sprawling metropolis filled with chambers and tunnels, modern caves and troll strongholds. Completely poisonous to our essence, but in the form of a man l try to adapt and sit always as near to a door or a window as l can. Rain that was once invigorating is now like a burning sheet of pain, full of trollish chemicals and pollution in the name of acid rain. I could form some great reactionary movement but neither the trolls nor man would ever stand for it. I am ignored as I'm not a threat but as a thorn to progress my existence would be like my forests and streams and clean oceans. Destroyed or tainted and polluted till nothing but trollish animals, rats, cockroaches, algae and poisonous chemicals remain. It seems almost eternity since man would have listened to me, once a god of Olympus, now the gods are corporate profits, scientists and trollish politicians.\nToday I sit here with the rain stumbling down, the trees, their sad leaves head down and the rain cascading of their ancient green backs like a torrent of fears. The roses that were flowering and the once lovely lavender jacarandas have thrown their pearls and sit like pretty ladies without any abode. The yard is covered with what were vibrant flowers but now discoloured petals mourned by fronds dripping ashen heavy tears\nTonight when the sky is bright l will transform into light and aim for the still mystic parts of the sky, I worry as light do l continue to feel, am l still alert, as for many millions of years that l will travel, one force, one form of energy could it become another, could l ever be myself again. I have existed as mountains, trees, fish and birds. Energy and force are probably an eternal death to me, l will not be missed nobody alive remembers me and if in the endless voids l can be aware. My tears will always be shed for my former earth.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

He had a Roman nose and his brows were more like a falcon's than a chick's. His jagged face, sun-blanched and weathered, had the tan color and contours of honed redwood. His eyes were ebony deep pools of coal.\n\"...be there in forty minutes.\"\nHe put the cell-phone down, pulled the covers off and rummaged in the dark for his slippers. The voice on the other end had a tensile timbre to it.\nA glimpse at the clock atop the night table showed one-twenty. He switched the light on and a copy of Fiery Particles by C. E. Montague dropped to the floor. He retrieved it, creased the page corner, and laid it back on the table next to the bonsai tree. In his boxer shorts, gangly and lean as a switch, he moseyed to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee brewing, then headed for the shower.\nSpecial Projects tracking sector resembled a hybrid of the Wall Street Exchange at peak hour and the Strategic Air Command at drill-time.\nChickbrow left the vault door behind - an orchestration of whines and clicks commenced when electronic locks and hydraulic tumblers secured it.\nNASA was never like this. He felt entombed within Tutankhamen's Pyramid.\nSeveral familiar faces scurried by hardly aware of his presence.\nKnitted brows straightened and the frown lines on his forehead smoothed out. His stride quickened. On the way to the complex center he unbuttoned his collar.\nThe place reeked of sweat and souring coffee.\nThe double, glass doors whooshed shut when he crossed the threshold and entered the glazed island cutting off the noise asunder.\n\"What's up?\"\n\"Sorry to get you up, Dave,\" Jeremy said, his back to him, his eyes darting over three monitors. \"We got a winner here.\" He shot a glance at a digital read-out then back to the monitors.\nChickbrow propped himself against one of the modules.\nMike Stromberg's raspy voice gruffed next to him, \"Take a look.\" He handed him a pad and scooted to his console.\nChickbrow pinched his ear. \"Give me relative course shift.\"\n\"Twenty-eight degrees, eight minutes...\"\n\"Just rough stuff, Mike.\"\n\"...and accelerating.\"\n\"What's pulling our little mascot?\" Chickbrow's black looked into Jeremy's blue eyes.\n\"Gravity.\" Jeremy tried to remain calm. He knew better than to antagonize that falcon gaze. Something about that look gave Jeremy the spooky feeling that he was on trial for his life. The feeling may have been incited by his boss's rather gaunt face, his spearing fixed look and withdrawn smile. Still... Jeremy had been with him all through the five years, attending him as if Chickbrow's edict was a mark on Jeremy's performance. Jeremy weighed painstakingly before he spoke again. \"Came out of the jump to reconnoiter...\" eye pressure, \"...as per standard procedure...\" an acrid burning scalded his empty stomach, \"...and got locked in a gravity well.\"\n\"Did you try rocketing loose?\"\n\"We'd waste precious fuel -\"\n\"More precious than risking a twenty-two billion dollar project?\" The lean man walked to a stack of print-outs.\nNothing - nothing recorded but interstellar vacuum.\nAs if reading his thoughts Mike returned, \"Vacuum doesn't have an attraction field,\" for an instant their eyes locked, the voice went flat, \"equal to a small sun.\"\n\"A dense core meteor - no, no that can't be,\" Chickbrow murmured.\nMike Stromberg, short and stocky, got up and headed for the door. It was time to make his rounds and initiate the countdown Chickbrow was so set on, pump ship too. The two glass blades hissed open at his approach. In streamed the buzz and din beyond. He paused a slight, \"The jump pods are kaput. Lucky we got coms,\" the door hissed behind him.\nThat'll rattle him up some, he jostled, and bolted for the head.\nThe two men inside the transparent shell remained silent. Through the thick glass of the control center Chickbrow saw a hundred hustling figures, all toiling to save SEPTOR.\nThree years ago the launched probe hurdled into space to chart a course for the Orion Castellation. The follow-up was to be a manned mission, the first of its kind. If SEPTOR was aborted it would mean a big black 'X' for Special Projects, his group, and Dr. Krell.\n\"Dave, thrust countdown program instated... scheduled for one minute fifty seconds. Three five-second shots. Anything over -\"\n\"I know,\" Chickbrow said putting aside his concerns. They had measured the attitude jets' and retro's fuel with an eye dropper.\nHe turned to Jeremy, \"Give me spherical electronic and visual scan - maximum range.\"\nIn three strides he was over the other's shoulders scrutinising the computer display .\n\"One minute thirty-five...\" Jeremy began sequence confirmation.\nOverhead a square three-by-three meter screen erupted to life. Glittering specks of brisk, brilliant lights swelled upon it. Heads from the outside turned to it.\n\"Instrument scan still nugatory.\"\nChickbrow looked up - and gasped. It happened every time the huge, veritable definition projector burst on. A familiar falling sensation emptied his lungs, like dropping in deep space. Into eternity.\nHe peered into the firmament: countless stars and clusters of stars and a quadrant of the Milky Way - an amethyst of dazzle that wanned all else.\n\"Sixty seconds...\" Jeremy's voice dithered. Harmony and chaos, creation unlimited, gloried before them. He had swivelled around to face the screen too. He upped his head, \"What you see is what you get.\"\n\"Magnify,\" Chickbrow was deaf.\n\"Dave, it's empty out there - nothing but faraway stars and black space.\"\nIt must have been Jeremy's tone that made Chickbrow hear the words.\n\"Normalize image.\"\n\"Forty seconds.\"\nThe astral plane rushed away leaving a tangled weave of tracers. The blurred blitz quickly stabilized, bloomed, and began a lethargic rotation.\n\"What did you say was out there?\"\n\"...stars, space, the Milky Way...\"\n\"Something else.\"\nJeremy rolled his eyes, \"Uhm, 'Nothing but faraway stars and empty space'?\"\n\"No, you said, black space.\"\n\"I did?\"\n\"Freeze it!\"\nThe firmament's motion halted.\n\"Automatic countdown in twenty seconds-mark!\" Jeremy wedged-in between ticking seconds.\n\"See it?\" Chickbrow squinted, his eyes tacked on the screen towering above them.\n\"Yeah, Urania the muse of astronomy,\" Jeremy vied for humor. \" It's the Orion spiral of the Milky Way, Dave. That's all we've been staring at, nothing there we haven't looked at before.\"\n\"Looked at, but didn't see -\" Chickbrow's face, the next instant, was flush with Jeremy O'Brien's, his mouth practically chewing on the other's headmike. \"Autocount! Acknowledge new sequence. Ten minutes... mark!\"\nChickbrow got his own head-rig on, \"Mike, tell somebody to get Professor Krell on the secure line, and beat feet back here.\"\nMike Stromberg puffed and grappled with the throng of scuttling bodies that jammed the aisles. He halted, sputtered a few words to one of the crew, then shuffled and shimmied his way through the rest of the beehive.\nNo good firing those pip-squeak rockets, he disputed silently, the pull on the puny craft is five times their top output.\n\"No way, Chickbrow!\" he declared to the throng, sticky with sweat.\nThe cold knifed through his furs and cut to the bone. So cold and dry was it that the snow dried and gritted in graupels. The air was tight and thick, and each breath he sucked scoured his throat like razzor shards of ice. His own breathing moisture had crystallized the hairs in his nostrils and encrusted his white bushy beard forming a niveous cornice that jutted from the gnarled, broad face. The beeper, aloof to his efforts, sounded again.\n\"All right, all right,\" he gruffed, \"hold your horses.\"\nHe removed the gloves upon entering the greenhouse and adjusted the thermostat and the humidifier. There was plenty of energy converted by the photoelectric cells to charge a couple dozen wet batteries and keep the vivarium running plus the cabin through the long Yukon nights. He got enough vegetables and fruit growing to provide for and balance an otherwise fish diet.\nAlaska claimed to be as isolated as a place can be, not considering the Poles and deserts.\nThe distracting city throngs, \"Bah!\" and those academia coops called universities. People pressed together, smelling and breathing each other's closeness - vulgar, intrusive, gagging! He had to suffer through it all so many times, the lectures in stuffy classrooms, the symposiums, deliberations and ceremonies. What an accolade of pomposity and touching.\nBesides, his work did not require the amenities of collectivism. On the contrary, noise and confusion only short-circuited his otherwise orderly synopses. It distracted from the job at hand: to colonize planets... and get the hell out! Still, even at this distant and obscure cranny, there were those that passed by, dropped in uninvited and pestered him with every nature of slight sliver and petty anxiety. Maybe Tibet would tender what he looked for. But too high to breath. And then there was the beeper. There's no getting away from that little runt.\nHe shut the door of his cabin and threw two of the logs he brought with him into the wanning amber and burgundy spews of the fireplace. After shifting the ash he settled next to the radio-phone and injected the thumb-size beeper into the inset.\n\"Dave Chickbrow please... what?... yes, yes, the Chief.\" Saddle tramp, he glowered at the machine. Don't give a hoot if he's chief or warrior. Redman, chinaman, blackman, batman - as long as they all keep away.\nProfessor Aristides Krell, slight and Neanderthal-looking, a man in his early fifties, was the recipient of two Nobel Prizes. One Nobel boasted that the brusque physiognomy had a slight but determining edge over Hawking, Mettropoulos, and Lovesigh involving The Unification Theory.\nWhile they endeavoured at snail-pace, restricted by the implements of customary science, he bounded steps beyond utilizing his own unorthodox theorems and radical observation procedures. His paradigm did not go unrewarded, for he had, intentionaly or not, unensconced a locality in the Cosmos where miracles abide: the place where electrons go to when they disappear; the venue from where virtual particles pop into conventional space-time; that vicinity of Creation which instantaneously informs one of a pair of photons, across the Universe, that its mate has not changed spin. Fun-space he called it, because it produced funny outcomes.\nThe second Nobel came for implementing his observations. SEPTOR vaunted instant communications. More important, SEPTOR used its unique communication pods (the funny part) to jump through myriads of parsecs of space. Instantaneously. Once a destination point was mapped - Ppfeuoot! - SEPTOR was there by the touch of a sense-plate.\nProject SEPTOR (SEarch for Planets of Terrestrial Organic Reliability) was Dr. Krell' brainchild. He fostered and reared it from concept to send-off. He was anxiously bent on exploring for colonizable worlds.\nBesides his ochlophobic temperament, Dr. Krell was partial to a rumour that spread around contending that Earth was tapped dry and would soon cease to subsist and harbor first, the human race, then, progressively, all of life.\nIn three centuries, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the consummation it scourged, the oil wells were running dry, the coal mines scraped clean, and the few remaining rain forests were guarded round the clock to keep axe-toters and poachers out.\nIf that wasn't presage enough, over the past fifty years the world ocean level had crept up two meters. The Dutch and the Italians were being crowded in, and the first to scream. But it was quickly and balmily hushed by other floods consisting of billions in E.C.U. and dollar relief. For it would have been easier to arrest an avalanche than to curtail the impetus of the snow-balling Titan called 'progress'.\nNo matter. The sequestered man that was Dr. Krell in one of his more eloquent and remarkable poetic moods was noted for his flippant but colourful flair, \"Spin me into a fun-beam and I shall fetch thee today the Earths of tomorrow.\"\nHe expelled a blue puff of smoke from his straight-stem pipe, \"Yea, I'll hold.\" Caller verification took a while. Silly rules. Made for mobs.\nChickbrow pointed to the screen, \"the source of our problem.\" He waited a while. The others studied the heavens in front of them.\nMike shrugged, \"Can't say I follow.\"\nJeremy nodded in unanimity.\n\"Space is colorless, Mike, empty space that is. It's not totally black. There is background always - direct, reflected or refracted light, gamma and cosmic rays, and a variorum of energy fields. The Universe does not stop because it cannot be seen.\n\"Yet, there,\" he indicated by enclosing an area in a dotted red window, \"the Universe - as we know it - does in fact stop.\" He pointed to the broad-spectrum meters lining the screen's bottom. All were pegged at zero radiation - and then some.\n\"That,\" he pointed to the gossamer of sparkling dust, \"is the Orion spiral as SEPTOR sees it. Twenty-eight degrees longitudinally, the highlighted area, is the source to which our craft is being diverted. So strong is the interference that it disrupts our tachyon reception even.\"\n\"That spiral arm is thousands of light years from SEPTOR,\" Mike countered.\n\"It is, but,\" Chickbrow shrank two arrow-head cursors on a small segment of the window, \"it doesn't quite fit, does it? Black emptiness in the middle of an otherwise densely populated spiral?\"\n\"Debris cloud, dark matter,\" Mike contended.\n\"Having such an intense gravetic field?\"\nJeremy angled his head to one side. \"Too regular shaped for debris. Can't help visualizing something close, something between the Orion spiral and us. A planet maybe.\" His head now leaned the other way.\n\"A meteor or a planet reflects. Debris too. Even a neutron star nucleus. That,\" he pointed, \"radiates nothing. Like it's hollow.\"\n\"A hole!\"\n\"All the fuel in the world wouldn't pry us loose. Wrong I was, Mike.\"\n\"Yea, but you got them sharp eyes of a falcon,\" Mike snorted.\nChickbrow loosened.\n\"Never told us how you came by that name,\" Jeremy briefly took his stare off the monitors.\n\"Baptismal mischance.\"\nChickbrow half-remembered the night's dream, but the sensations were fully present, feelings of protection and security. He was glad his grandfather's spirit decided to make amends for the minor oversights, and looked over him now. He hedged a spell, then, \"I was a month-old papoose when my mother left me with gramps at the pueblo so she could go and get some grubs from the Post store. Gramps kept a chicken coop behind the hogan. Supplied him fresh eggs and poultry meat. But it didn't have any door to it, gramps was sachem, tribal chief, and partial to autonomy, so the fowl roamed like steer over an open pampas. Mother returned to find me being pecked by a flock of newly-hatched chicks. Nothing catastrophic, but my eyebrows gone and... the name.\"\nA high-pitched whine from Mike's console intruded.\n\"Dr. Krell on the line,\" a nondescript voice called out.\n\"Put him through.\" Chickbrow hunched his shoulders and flipped the com switch. Then to Jeremy, \"Tell countdown to keep us posted every minute on the minute. The last minute, every ten seconds.\"\nSeven minutes remaining, the speaker echoed.\n\"That sums it up, Professor.\"\nA long silence followed.\n\"Dr. Krell,\" Chickbrow called into the communicator, \"are you still there?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Sir?\"\nA sigh, \"I'm only sorry I'm not at the center.\"\nFour minutes remaining.\n\"I heard, Dave.\"\n\"Shall I stop the countdown?\"\n\"No.\"\nChickbrow glanced at the other two.\n\"No, not now. Too late for anything, but -\"\n\"We're accelerating. Reception is breaking down,\" Chickbrow reported. All three stared at the intermittent and erratic rips and wavering stars on the crackling screen above them.\n\"It's slowing down our tachyons. Unbelievable!\" Dr. Krell cried. A few seconds of silence hung like stale air. \"No wonder SEPTOR cant jump, tachyons can't function at light-speed, or below it.\"\nChickbrow rubbed his aching temples.\nTwo years' work and hope lost to an anomaly, the prima materia, of the Universe. A singularity. A black hole. A rent in the fabric of space-time. Hundreds of millions of man-hours, sweat and diligence all flushed down a fathomless pitch-dark toilet.\nHe raked through the bristles of his crow hair.\nMike and Jeremy grimaced.\nIt was hurt.\nThey were hurting. He cringed with their pain, and his.\nIt wasn't the space budget, or the big black X, or that an Indian had failed, or the lay-offs. They could all live with those.\nIt was their faith being betrayed.\nThree minutes remaining.\nThis whole undertaking was an act of faith. Trust in the synergy of man. He wanted to believed that a cooperative humanity of separate agencies could have a far greater total effect than the sum of the effects taken independently.\nIt was to be a peaceful, long-awaited interface with the Universe; a communion of mankind and the 'great beyond', with the infinite rolling pastures of the Cosmos. The liberation of Earth from humankind's abrasive sway.\n\"Damn! Professor. So - so sorry.\"\n\"We're not gods, Dave.\" The voice came slow and low now. \"Only children playing gods.\" After the initial exhilaration of actually confronting a black hole wore off, the old sage sounded drawn and spent -\n\"Patch your terminal output to my line,\" Dr. Krell's voice sprang through, \"and let's take a look at SEPTOR's specifications.\"\nChickbrow engaged a set of electronic links from the main memory banks. A whirring synchopated with a whizzing somewhere along the metallic frames encompassing them. Patters of buffered snapping and popping overspilled their enclosures to carry over to him.\n\"What are we looking for?\" Chickbrow asked, riddled at the other's impromptu request.\n\"A miracle.\"\nJust then three sets of brows pranced.\n\"Excuse my Laconic vain,\" the voice held a vestige of intensity, \"but it is sometimes wise to cater to the paradox. I'll shortly explain. Look at sheet EE-40.\"\nTwo minutes remaining.\nThey read.\n\"SPECTOR is slick as a bullet, or a jumbo cannon shell. Its jacket - the outside layer - is glass steel, designed to withstand nominal micrometeor impacts and permit minimum conductance to extraneous fields. Its durable, solid, and, I believe, it will cushion near-relativistic accelleration stresses.\"\nChickbrow scanned the spec sheet a second time. His eye caught in the text all that the Professor talked about.\nMike and Jeremy nodded.\n\"I'm with you so far,\" Chickbrow said.\n\"Good. Because here's the miracle....\"\nThe tracking sector complex of Special Projects was quiet as a church on Monday. For the past few hours there had been not much more than murmurs and whispers. Technicians with pencils stuck over their ears and scientists with calculators clenched in their fists huddled in pensive, scattered clusters.\nBehind the enveloping glass panes of the control center Jeremy, assailed by the mulligrubs, lackadaisically massaged the sides of his head with his thumbs. Mike, himself hounded by blue devils, slumped in his chair chewing on a pencil.\nChickbrow was considering.\nDr. Krell had explained very simply a very complex supposition. The essence was, that SEPTOR use its retro and attitude rockets to accelerate towards the black hole. Then, at a critical point, when its drift equalled that of the surrounding flux heading for the hole, jump into the hole. He explained, of course, that since the direction of the jump was not in opposition to the pull of the singularity the tachyon generator pods would work.\nThey did. SEPTOR had been saved.\nThe craft was in orbit around Earth. Its telescopes and biosphere-sensing apparatus were sending in a flood of crisp, intelligible data.\nThe data was checked and re-checked, but the results did not vary by much: the Poles were missing, the seas too, and the atmosphere, and life.\n\"All those jumps,\" Chickbrow could still hear the Professor's matter of fact and lulling articulation, \"were so much time stored.\"\n\"How much time do we have, Dr. Krell?\" the Top Executive had asked on the direct line.\n\"Oh, the black hole devoured most of it, and, let's see, there's the return trip - we managed to do that in three jumps, so we saved some time there. My calculations say twoenty-five years, plus\/minus five, Mr. President.\"\nChickbrow had left the public announcement system on and the commendations followed (probably a third Nobel was in the making somewhere in Sweden for the Professor).\nSpecial Projects was now The Special Projects Group and funds restrictions were immediately lifted. While SEPTOR circled the Earth of a quarter of a century into the future, somehow relaying images of a dreadful prophecy, a new perspective involving the planet seemed to be in the making.\nBut people, Chickbrow reflected, dodn't really want to migrate to the stars because their home was condemned. They'd want to go there, sure, but they'd want a home to return to. Just then words from an old, twentieth century song came to mind, 'You don't know whatcha got \/ until you lose it \/ You gave me all your love \/ but I misused it'.\nIn the twenty-third century folk worked together to save SEPTOR, and it proved to them that this oneness had also achieved to warn and prepare humanity; to show the yield that was man's folly.\n\"Professor,\" he spoke cheerlessly into the unbroken link, \"can't Earth be saved? If there was an all out effort, couldn't we change the future?\"\n\"In a finite universe there are finite possibilities, and our Universe is finite, Dave. Then again, there are finite choices - but by no means are these few.\"\n\"Then there is a possibility since choices exist?\"\n\"Existed.\" There was sternness now in the professor's tone. \"There is trend along with choice, and man's overall tendency has been to consistantly make the wrong choices. We, ourselves, have elected to stray to the edge of the cliff. Millions upon millions, a history of choices are now proving themselves fallacious.\"\nChickbrow frowned. \"Then we'll drag it all with us to wherever we go.\" There were moments in his life, few in all, that measured forever. In these moments it seemed that every spirit of his ancestors, every brave and squaw that has ever been or that would ever be, was bemoaning its inmost misery at him. \"We'll land on a new world with great expectations and pent up longing, but carry all the old vices and failings.\" He glared around him like a snared lynx.\nJeremy and Mike listened, apparently in no mood to contribute.\n\"Dave,\" the Professor, sensing the other's distress, inverted to a fatherly tone, \"man learns from his mistakes.\"\n\"But not quick enough.\"\n\"Quick enough?\"\n\"Quick enough to save man with respect and honor,\" he lashed out. \"To survive without decimating and ravaging first. Quick enough to quit being arrogant adolescents, get our act together, and start strutting faith in ourselves and some trace of propriety and pride - dignity too.\"\n\"Dignity?\"\n\"Have we outgrown that word, Dr. Krell?\" he dampened a pinch. \"Or have we elbowed it aside?\"\n\"I didn't know indian people had so much romance in them, Dave. You so elegantly just pointed out one of my fallacies! Ignorances, really. That's what the world is, ignorant, not arrogant, Dave.\n\"No, I don't think dignity has been outcasted. It's a brittle word and needs to be protected. So we lodge it somewhere deep inside of us, and forget it, like honor. Ill-used so often.\"\nThe communicator went silent for a moment. \"You want to hear of another, second miracle? This line is coded, isn't it? Nobody can listen in?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"This has to be kept privy. Otherwise, it won't work.\"\nChickbrow looked at Mike and Jeremy.\n\"Indian's word.\"\n\"Good enough.\"\nChickbrow detected a kind of puckish fun-lovingness there. The Professor's composed bearing and phlegmatic diction hastily turned puerile.\n\"Our Universe may be finite, Dave, but I've got a hunch its not the only one around. That black 'pit' of a hole slung SEPTOR way out. I think we've manoeuvred SEPTOR in another space-time continuum, altogether. Anchored it to an Earth of another, but analogous, universe.\"\nThe two men slowly stood up and walked to the communicator.\nChickbrow quailed, \"You mean that's not our Earth?\"\n\"It doesn't have to be. Tachions can't propagate through time alone; that's like someone siting in a chair here on Earth and waiting for the passage of time to transport them to Alpha Centaury. There has to be spacial displacement involved, too!\"\n\"If I copy,\" Chickbrow broke in, \" you're saying those pictures we're getting from SEPTOR are not of our future? But the future of an ersatz - a proxy Earth?\"\n\"May not, Chickbrow, may not be our own future. The Uncertainty Principle says it, not me.\n\"On the other hand, it might be our Earth at that. Time, you see, stops inside a black hole. There is no present there, only a future. Things outside a singularity, if they could be observed (an impossibility of course), would dash about with ungodly speed, many times that of light. Within a blink of our black-hole-observer billions of years would have elapsed - galaxies born, matured and died - all in this instant. So, in transpiring through the hole, even by a spontaneous jump, who can say that SEPTOR was not delayed an infinitesimal of a blink? But still to emerge in our Universe, with merely a mite detainment of a quarter century.\"\n\"But the space\/time factor, aren't you ignoring it now?\" Chickbrow rebounded.\n\"I don't know, Dave. That's the funny part. Paradoxes work within their own very esoteric, awfully private laws. So ethereal and touchy are these that if we were to intrude upon them, upon this other, second, miracle by conventional scientific analysis, or simply locution, we'd be ruffling the very time-space fabric or, worse, cause the miracle to fail.\" There was a pause.\n\"Just by talking about it!\" Chickbrow's voice pitched tenor-high.\n\"Yeap.\"\n\"That's why he didn't tell the President,\" Mike broke in.\n\"What's that?\" Dr. Krell blared over the line.\n\"Mike and Jeremy are here with me,\" Chickbrow appended, somewhat disturbed.\n\"Oh, Chickbrow,\" the voice groaned, \"you had given me your word!\"\nThe three looked bewildered.\n\"Sir, I didn't realize the gravity - it's only two more people who know -\"\n\"Only two. Here I grappled in dilemma whether to tell you and just you alone. Kept back information from the President. And you say only two!\"\n\"Dr. Krell,\" Jeremy tried to mollify the afflicted scientist, \"I'm not going to talk about it - to anyone, not to my wife even.\"\nMike, puzzled at the turn of things, snorted. We really need guys like you, he said under his bulky orange mustache, with all this joy breaking out all over. Then more loudly, \"Professor, I'm not going to talk about this thing - even at confession. And I'm Catholic!\"\n\"No, no - it's the knowledge of it,\" Dr. Krell bellowed, \"the knowing itself that effects the outcome. This new modicum of erudition now vacillating in two additional brains - your brains Mike and Jeremy - brings into play a uniquely separate causality. Even mere thinking can warp the quantum mechanisms.\" Then, as though to himself, \"People are timid creatures, they won't want to stick around to find out if Earth will end up like that. They'd want OUT!\"\n\"You want them to believe that that's our Earth?\" Chickbrow pointed to the screen unaware that the other could not see it.\n\"Don't you? If it is our Earth we're getting those signals from, how else will we change its future? Save it? But to get people involved building space arks instead of more Earth-sapping, air-choking industries and people-cluttering institutions and plants. Now's the chance to channel industry not to industries, and to this mad and frenetic proliferation that's suffocating us, but direct it to charting other voyages, for other new Americas - but out there this time. Trundle humanity from its blissful hari-kari. Jiggle people out of their stupor so they neglect to go on killing this planet. \"\n\"It's a decoy, Professor,\" Chickbrow's tone sombred, \"to say the least.\"\n\"An honorable decoy, wouldn't you say? Or do you endorse that cinder upon your screen? 99.999 percent of Earth's population, Chickbrow, is ignorant that a Universe exists. Ask'em, 'What's that thing sparkling up in the sky?' They say, 'A Star.' And you ask, 'What is a star?' 'A thing that comes out at night.' And that's where most people's tuition ends concerning the magnitude of what surrounds us.\"\n\"'Man learns' your own words, Professor. And, Professor, don't dignity and honor infer truth? Hoodwinking mankind, is it really the solution? There's a Chinese saying by Lao-tzu, 'A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.' Can't this be that one, first, and significant step\/choice that is not fallacious, out of the history of choices? Wouldn't we be only burgeoning the world's ignorance by withholding this knowledge?\"\n\"If you tell the world,\" the professor parried, \"that that may not be Earth, our future, do you think the world would benefit from the doubt? Trend, Chickbrow, has a robustly frightful and protracted impetus in our case - thousands of years of lowly, dishonouring, and contemptful choices.\n\"Only if the charred site of Earth blares bluntly at them, like a tombstone epitaph, will people get the message. Authority, someone said, rarely survives in face of doupt. We need autority, here and now, not doubt. Man is lazy, Dave. All else he'll humour away - all but raw consternations like fear, alarm, shock. These proved to function in the past. Got the ball rolling...\"\nMike had noticed it first.\nA slow undulation of colors on the globe depicted overhead. Every time Chickbrow spoke the sphere's surface texture seemed changed by a bit - the hews appeared less parched-reds and desert-ambers, and more fertile-browns; even small specks of greens dabbed the Earth here and there.\nHe nudged Jeremy and both observed these pigments fade as Dr. Krell finished rebutting.\n\"Duress, Dr. Krell, works ephemerally, not enduringly. In the long run that which survives is that which humankind has sustained by its freedom to choose, may that even be its very end. It's called responsibility and consequence. If men and women are inept it is not because they are inapt, but because the attitude as such has been fixated into them and misled them...\"\nNot only were the greens and browns spreading now, but there were smidgens of resonant cyans emanating from vast, deep-seated canyons while pearly, frosty whites glimmered at the Poles.\nMike looked at Jeremy, and Jeremy returned Mike's look and buoyed up.\nMike next put a hand on Chickbrow's shoulder giving a heartening clasp. Jeremy patted him behind the other shoulder, esprit de corps fashion.\nChickbrow, cheered by his aimcriers, drove on, cleaving through Dr. Krell's tenuous grounds and despondent argumentation, motives and goals.\nEvery once in a while the two would glimpse over their shoulder, and when the professor happened to speak they would cough and belch and Mike would let out air in loud raucous fits.\nThe introspective faces from those outside turned to the screen one-by-one. As each pair of eyes beheld the metamorphosis, a maelstrom began to brew over the Earth. A pandemonium of blooming wrought forth more pasture-greens, azure-blues, and feathery drifts of whites. The shrill of cheers and applause infiltrated the sound-proofing.\n\"What's all that noise, Chickbrow?\"\nWhen Chickbrow turned, a new Earth confronted him. One he had seen many times and was so familiar with.\n\"It's only another miracle,\" he said. Then, the ebony eyes wise and smiling, \"Professor, about doubt, Roosevelt, I think, said, 'The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.'\"\nMike grunted with pleasure and graciously flipped the com switch off. Uninterupted now, they all watched their bonhomie future-nest forge anew before them, by them.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Sometimes we must say goodbye to ourselves, and move to a new soul, deserting the old as the dying rays of the sun forsake the dim earth. Sometimes, we all have to leave.\nWhy not? It's not as if mired in this inane, absurd existence any of us have found a way to transcend the mundane paradox of life. Caged in this metaphysical quagmire of being we can either pick ourselves up, or drop way down below. Sometimes, dropping makes more sense.\nAlways, it is the easier thing to do.\nI myself can attest to the art of creative suicide. It is a way of life for me. Paradoxically it is a way of death, too. Metempsychosis, the ancient Greeks called it; transmigration of the soul. A mass of teeming memories; ten thousand years in a river of fire, rebirth, streams of forgetfulness, waters of immemorial Lethe. Then I remember. Then I fall. Then I die.\nDeath is the cleanser; tainted with the secular scum of this world, only through death can we purify ourselves in the fiery aether. There is no will strong enough, no passion fervent enough to resist the pull of death, if you need to go. Dying we will be made whole again.\nAfter all, do we not subsist only on shadows, pale reflections of the true divine order? Death transforms us, freeing our eyes from the pallid simulacra of worldly things. Unchained from the constraints of our bodily dungeon, we gaze at eternity, if only for an instant. Like some watcher of the skies I strive to perceive that which is closed to me, vainly seeking the answers without myself, as silent as that peak in Darien.\nI bleed when I write. If you prick me, do I not bleed? My thoughts hemorrhage from my mind as I wring emotions from my soul the way blood flows from a fl(r?)esh wound. I bleed when I write. I die as I speak to you now. Eternal fire. Constant flux. Dynamic and interminable at once, the paradigm of the unity of opposites. Herein lies the most fundamental of all paradoxes of existence, the dichotomy between change and stasis. Ceaselessly changing within predetermined and ageless limits, striving to gain knowledge of the irreducible element of all things; the fire divine. And yet, and yet, if the world be in such a state of permanent flux, then surely no fixed reality exists which can be known by us? Does the ineluctable modality of the visible escape us so completely?\nAshes to ashes... dust to dust. Diaphanous flames shimmer in the desert of night as the Phoenix rises from his egg of myrrh. Immortality <-> Rebirth. The Wheel of Life turns once more. The Phoenix. Perpetual bird of millennia, reaching for the city of the Sun, Eternal City, Heavenly Jerusalem, to consummate life in Ra's altar. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.\nFear of death? Death is the only certainty, the one thing about life that is absolutely guaranteed. And yet we cannot live, if we do not die. Another paradox? Life as we know it, is just another death we have lived. Now we move on to the next level of being.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

For all of his long life, Dr Hunter had practiced his vocation in a humane way, skillfully and honorably. The people who had known him for all of his eighty-four years, which he had spent with dignity, could see the real meaning of the phrase, a decent gentleman. When his private safe was opened, beside the envelope containing his will, another envelope was found. It had been duly sealed with red wax that bore the stamp of a London notary, one Silenius Harvey. Dr Hunter's close relatives broke the seal, and several leaves written over in the deceased man's hand fell out of the envelope. Nobody, however, took further interest in them after it was ascertained they had nothing to do with the will itself. Nobody, that is, except the last surviving of Dr Hunter's seven cousins. His name was Richard Emerson. A London magazine obviously overheard something or other about that envelope's contents. One of their executives offered Mr. Emerson a generous fee in exchange for his consent to place it at their disposal to publish. He squarely refused. The lines that follow have not been perused by any but Dr Hunter's closest friends. They are a true transcript of the pages found in the dead man's safe.\n\"My wish is that the contents of this envelope are handed over, after my demise, to my cousin Richard Emerson or to his heir if he has such. Should Richard die before me, I desire the envelope to be burnt with no disclosure or announcement regarding its contents. \"I consider Mr. Emerson the most intelligent of my kin and place my exclusive trust upon him. For this reason I suppose he shall understand why I have never confided to him the thing that happened to me on February 3rd, 1840. If that were let out, I should lose part of my clientele, or perhaps all of it. I really think that if my colleagues chance to learn about the incident, they will take me for a madman. That is why I shall seal the envelope in the presence of a notary and then keep it locked in my safe as long as I live.\n\"Few are the London physicians who, at 23 years of age, enjoyed a reputation and a prestige like mine, and last but not least, a rich and respectable clientele. I say this proudly because I have never for a moment neglected my professional duties and what is more I am always civil and honest to the people around me.\n\"It is precisely out of loyalty to the client whose house I was leaving on the third of February, 1840, that I shall not mention his rank or name. As far as I can see, they would be out of place in the writings of a (as your conclusion shall be, cousin Richard) doctor half off his mind.\n\"I had just come out of the house of the abovementioned client of mine when I fairly collided with that little girl. I made an attempt to beg her pardon, but she cut me short, saying:\n'S'cuse me, mister, are you a doctor?'\n'Certainly, dear. Why do you ask; does anything hurt you?'\n'No, sir. But my mummy's real sick, and you have to come cure her.'\n\"I looked the child over. She had a sort of gray-checkered coat on, wore a dark blue skirt that was just a bit too large, and round her neck a wine-colored scarf. Hers were a pair of mocking blue eyes and her fair hair was shaggily plaited; all in all, her small face looked both innocent and mischievous. She was, I presumed, in no position to pay me for a visit of the most common kind, let alone a treatment demanding the use of expensive medicines. \"Well, I had taken my Hippocratic oath. Moreover, the child struck me as pleasant and bold. I told her:\n'Right, dear. Lead me to your mother.'\n'It's not here that we live, mister. Our house's a long way from this place.'\n\"She pronounced the name of a run-down London suburb. It was poor and at a great distance, several miles, from the spot we stood in.\n'Why, that's a long way, indeed!' I said in indignation.\n\"I suddenly had a vision of myself as a frazzled physician, short of sleep and running around all London, treating any odd caller for free.\n'Look here, kid, I can't just run a few miles to your place on account of your mummy being sick.'\n'Please, mister, do it, or she will die. YOU MUST COME WITH ME!'\nUpon uttering these words, the girl looked into my eyes. I sensed myself being hypnotized and knew I lacked the will to refuse her. I gave my consent: 'All right, I'm coming. But we are not going to walk there.'\n\"I hailed the first cab that caught my eye and we mounted it. My young lady gave the address, but the cabby didn't seem to have heard, asking instead: 'Where shall I drive to, Doc?' I had to repeat the child's words.\n\"The kid kept swaying her small feet and stared at the streets of London, amazed. I queried her:\n'What do they call you, elf?\"\n'Patricia Mallory. But everybody calls me Patty! And what about you?\"\n'My name's Nicolas. Call me Nick. How did you know I was a doctor?\"\n'You've got a fat bag with a little red cross upon if, she indicated my bulging bag. \"I went on with the questions:\n'And why did you place your choice on me, out of all the doctors of London?\"'\n\"She sucked a thumb, pensive:\n'Don't know. You look so kind, both on the outside and the inside, too.'\n'Thanks. I wasn't aware of that.'\n\"For a while we drove in silence. Then Patty said imploringly:\n'Nick, are you really goin' to make my mum well again?'\n\"I felt like sneaking out of it somehow. I muttered:\n'I do not know. It depends on what she's sick from.'\n'I hope you make her well, Doc!' she had copied the cabby's form of address.\n\"We reached Patty's home at last. It turned out to be a small old house without any airs, built of stone and mortar. Its wooden roof had a layer of tiles upon it, black with time.\n\"I paid the cabby. The horses clacked their hoofs on the roadway and disappeared in the rising fog. Patty said:\n'Mum's in here.'\n\"After that she tore the topmost button off her coat and slipped it into my hands.\n'This is a gift from me, Nick. Let it bring you luck.'\n\"Then she turned and walked away and into the fog. I wondered should I catch up with her.\n\"I entered the miserable little house. I had to climb a flight of hollow wooden stairs that screeched ominously. The front door opened on a shabby hall, its floor laid with a ragged but clean rug. On the left there was a hat and coat rack, its pegs rusty. Down the hall I made out two doors; behind one of those a raspy cough could be heard.\n\"I knocked and went into Patty's mother's chamber. She was covered up to her chin with a beige blanket. She had an intelligent face, sweating and pale with the disease. Her hazel eyes were moist and her brown tresses lay disordered on the pillow.\n\"She was too sick to get frightened of me. Her question came sharply:\n'Who are you?' Next she noticed my doctor's bag.\n'Whoever you might be, I have no money to pay you.'\n'My name is Nicolas Hunter. I am a doctor with a degree from Eton. I'll help you not for payment but because I like your daughter.'\n'How dare you say such things, mister; my daughter has been dead these three months!'\n'You are rather badly sick, Mrs. Mallory. I suppose your illness has dimmed your understanding. Your little girl met me on Thames Street and brought me, past three neighborhoods, here so that I can cure you. She even gave me this button as a token.'\n\"Mrs. Mallory grew terribly excited and started screaming: 'Quit molesting me, mister, and leave my house! This button is from the little coat we buried my daughter in. You must be some nasty quack that's torturing a sick woman. GET OUT!!!'\n\"She pointed at me and made the sign of the devil with her left hand. Then she crossed herself with her right hand, waving it at me to shoo me away.\n\"I saw it fit to put her to sleep, administering laudanum. Having examined her and finding she had acute bronchitis, I gave her an injection. I wouldn't be able, however, to help her if I didn't persuade her to take some pills, so I waited for her to wake up.\n\"As soon as she came to her senses, Mrs. Mallory started swearing and waving me off. I explained I was going away the moment she took orally the tablets and capsules I had prescribed her.\n\"I left her side with the firm resolution not to visit this rotten neighborhood ever again.\n\"Towards dusk on the following day I felt that the pocket I keep my watch in (an \"Omega\" with a thick silver chain) is starting to give off smoke. I thrust my hand into it, wondering how come a watch should catch fire. Next to the \"Omega\" I touched little Patty's button. It was hot, I'd say incandescent. It instantly scalded my fingers. Nevertheless I was not able to pull my hand free of my pocket. The stiffened limb did not respond, as if it was not mine but another person's.\n\"Marveling at this phenomenon, I went out into the street not quite aware of what I was doing. Something made me halt a cab and, to my surprise, I heard my own voice say:\n'412 Bugger Place.'\n\"This was Miss and Mrs. Mallory's address. Nearing their home, I sensed that the button was gradually losing its heat. When I went into the sick woman's room, it had turned cold as ice.\n\"Today Mrs. Mallory was definitely in a better temper. Her cheeks were flushed while her warm brown eyes had a placid look. Her narrow face shone with contentment.\n'Mr. Hunter, I want to apologize for my behavior of yesterday. Patty came to me in my dreams and told me I didn't have to be so rude to you.'\n'Look, Mrs. Mallory, Patty told me you were ill, but, well, you act like a madwoman.'\n\"Her face grew serious and she asserted:\n'I can see you think me mental. I assure you my daughter is dead. To satisfy yourself on this account, will you please look at the death certificate on the table? And on the wall to your right you will see an obituary that announces the departure of my beloved Patty.'\n\"There was really a death certificate on the table, issued in the name of Patricia Johnson Mallory. The obituary on the wall dated three months previous, was in the same name. \"I felt my flesh begin to creep. Had I had a mere hallucination of that sweet little child? Was the button in my waistcoat pocket simply the fruit of my morbid fancy?\n\"Mrs. Mallory smiled sadly.\n'My daughter Pat is really dead. Last night she came to my in my sleep and said: \"Mum, don't treat this man like that. He is the best-hearted doctor in all of London. And soon he shall become the best-known.\"'\n\"I was flattered by Mrs. Mallory's words. But it was not they that made me believe little Pat had been dead and gone. Nor the certificate of death.\n\"The thing that convinced me was the small hole burnt in my pocket.\n\"We kept up the treatment for about a month. Aided by injections, inhalations and pills, and also an amount of skills, I should add, her health was restored. Gwinnet Mallory proved to be an intelligent woman, one of the few I could talk to sincerely and straight to the point. Most of the women of renown or the noble ladies I knew did not possess a quarter of her mind and style.\n\"Upon completion of the treatment, I developed a habit of taking her to dinner once or twice every month. She did not have a husband-he had escaped after hearing the news of her carrying a baby, Patty.\n\"Nor was Gwinnet searching for one. We did not have an affair in any serious sense. We just sat down somewhere, ordered something and started talking. On various topics. More often than not about little Patricia. Sometimes I dreamt of her. Sometimes she did. One night we both dreamt of her.\n\"The next day saw the demise of my best friend-William Strawberry.\n\"While standing at his funeral, I kept squeezing Patty's button in my hand.\n\"It was hot.\nFebruary 18, 1845\nDr. Nicolas Robert Hunter, a Physician by the good grace of God and Her Royal Highness' truthful subject.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

In the face of such times, the interior of his LS8 Lincoln was appropriately deferential... wood trim, seat heaters, fancy trip computer, the works. A paean to his Prime Earning Years. Even the car's nomenclature was luxurious, baby-boomer patois; LS8 was an alpha-numerical Euro-fantasy meant to the disguise the fact that the big overpriced hunk of ore was made in Wixom, Michigan. Big Mike was a handsome, well-heeled, reasonably articulate white guy; a sales executive for a Fortune 500 corporation. He spent a good chunk of his working life inside his company auto, spinning the odometer thirty thousand times in the course of a year, and the comfortable, rubber-isolated passenger shell gave him two degrees of isolation from a throbbing, impersonal cosmos.\nInside the car, where existence was formulaic, he generally felt safe, controlled and appreciated. Buff and ultraconfident. Within a state of grace. Outside the car, there were problems. Real life was non-pristine. It was dark, dense, and inscrutable. Out there, he swam through a fog of vague anxiety, sopped in low-grade tension and a sense that things... things weren't entirely kosher... Despite having been his doting mother's blind spot and a track star in school, despite an MBA from Weems Business College, a substantial track record inside a mainstream, multi-billion dollar concern, a covetable wife and a strong Nordic chin, he'd never been able to fully shake the idea that the big, wanking, objective universe was laughing at him.\nBig Mike betrayed all the classical symptoms of obsessive-compulsion neurosis. Up until recently, he'd been pumped and bumptious and Lincoln-oriented enough to keep it under wraps. But recently, the worm of truth had gone looking for ingress, slithering through chinks in his understated Wixom armor. Squirts of dread had begun to sting him from its precision-louvered airvents. Today for example, as a favor to his department head, he was driving some weird-smelling foreign consultant to the airport, when, without warning, he found his subtle, precariously ballasted peace-of-mind under assault from the goddamn airwaves.\nThe foreigner's name was Abu ben Berber; he came from somewhere in Africa. To hear him tell it, he was the sole intellectual in a country where inflation was three thousand percent and the government was run by bored teenaged bullies with AK47s. He held a hard-won Ph.D. from the University of Kazumba, and was the current research director at the El Abbasiya Physical Analysis Institute in Spez; not too shabby for a guy born in a hut made of goat dung and eucalyptus slats. Dr. ben Berber was a go-getter, but to Big Mike Doornbos, he looked like an extra from an Exodus stage-set... his head swaddled in a prayer shabba, ethnic bobs dangling from various extremities, a huge desert-colored shawl draped over an orange velveteen sweat suit. Abu ben Berber had been brought Stateside by Big Mike's COO's as an advisor in an electron miscropy issue, and had trumped his six-week stay by securing an elite seat on the Ellipsometric Studies of DLKU Adsorption Technology Conference panel. No doubt about it, Abu ben Berber was a sharp tack, miniature feet and glittery slippers notwithstanding. Still, conversation in the car that morning was clipped.\nDr. ben Berber tended to speak in obtuse rumbles and made obnoxious, whiney sounds between his syllables, like his upper airways were obstructed. Conversing with ben Berber was like chit-chatting with Mama Cass while she was choking to death. Plus, he had the sort of hyperkinetic brain that disgorged equations and cosmological constants far more easily than small talk. So, Big Mike gave his odd passenger a lopsided nod of bonhomie, and opted to import some noise through the Lincoln's top-drawer audio system, slogging around a dial dominated by the sort of mornonic morning gabfests that came and went like fruit flies on Carmen Miranda's scalp. He lit on a newly-syndicated program out of Los Angeles, The Uncle Murphy Hour, on 98.3 FM, and paused, listening, as his heart did a little pirouette within his chest cavity. Pausing was a big mistake, because within ten seconds, a chain reaction of thought-association began in Big Mike's cortex, and shortly, he was fumbling for his Xanax stash, trying to dissipate an explosion of anxiety, loosen his tightening chest, dry up the sudden whoosh of brow juice that erupted between his temples. Uncle Murphy unleashed very negative vibes inside Big Mike's psychodynamics; Uncle Murphy brought on a mother of a panic attack. Not Uncle Murphy, the blithering soap-box sophist; Uncle Murphy the concept.\nAs a matter of fact, Big Mike's personal issues with 98.3 FM signaled a phase transition within reality that turned out to be the beginning of the end of the universe. But that happened later on in the afternoon.\nNow, as Big Mike tuned in, the left-coast shock jock began a strident, juvenile harangue about the joys of clandestine sex in public, specifically, inside grocery stores, so graphic that you'd suppose the entire FCC was on an extended bender, sitting in a pub somewhere, nodding to a juke box. But Mike wasn't listening to Uncle Murphy's story, centered on some perverted exploit down a Piggy Wiggley produce aisle; Big Mike was flash-backing to a different Uncle Murphy, his own Uncle Murphy; Dad's younger brother, Murphy Doornbos, who'd lived with them on Ashland Avenue for a few years during Mike's childhood. Murphy Doornbos had come back from Pleiku with a big, gaping shrapnel wound in his lower back, and needed round-the-clock care since basically, Murphy couldn't breathe, or eat, and had to be fed through the hole in his back. Ultimately, Uncle Murphy died on Ashland Avenue, on a crisp October Sunday morning, when Mike was seven years old. Big Mike conjured up the death-day as a very clear image inside his head. An hour before dying, Uncle Murphy had been reading him the colored comics from the weekend paper. Strip by strip, out loud; it was a little, friendly, avuncular sort of ritual they'd developed. Big Mike remembered that particular morning in such vivid detail that the sour reek of his uncle's gastric juices re-appeared in his sinuses... putrid thing, the human body...\nUncle Murphy had begun with Blondie, where the subject was Dagwood's hysterical discomfort with Cookie kissing her boyfriend among the frozen vegetables while the family was engaged in the weekly shopping. As usual, the strip was about as funny as an infected canker sore, but when Uncle Murphy read the next one down, Terry and the Pirates, the circumstance of the plot was nearly identical; Rouge was trading spit with our favorite buzz-boy in an open-air fruit market to distract him from the sneak Jap attack. \"Boy, ain't that a coinkydink...\" Uncle Murphy had said with an equivocal scowl, sucking oxygen from a nearby machine. 'Coinkydink' was Uncle Murphy's cutesy pronunciation of 'coincidence', of course. With the next assisted breath, he was fairly shouting, \"Boy oh boy! Lookee here, Mikey! Another coinkydink...\" and jerking his finger at L'il Abner, who was sprawled beneath an orbit of stars, having been crowned by a lovesick Earthquake McGoon for drooling on Daisy Mae's seam-busting bosoms in front of the Gen'ral Store. And the next strip, Smokey Stover, was filled with grammatical mayhem around the same theme, public displays of horniness, and included the excruciating pun, 'Passion Fruit', with a crudely drawn image of anthropomorphic kumquats engaged in near-coitus. And the next, and the next... Uncle Murphy's eyes were big as hub caps, and he became far more exited than his condition could regulate... \"Hey, this has gotta be coinkydink... The whole fuckin' supplement... Hubba, hubba! Gimme a witness! Major, major coinkydink....\" And so on. For some weird reason, all the comic strips on that frosty autumn Sunday had sported the same basic punch line, and an hour later, Uncle Murphy had wheeled himself out into the back yard, underneath the pin oak, swallowed a mouthful of Percodan, slipped a plastic bag over his head, and strangled on his own puke.\nIn retrospect, Mike admitted, it was the kind of memory that he'd probably invented; it was probably a sequence from some febrile, childhood dream. But it hardly made any difference. Dream or not, the sudden, multiple connections of 'Uncle Murphy', an unusual name to begin with, the juxtaposition of sex-in-public innuendoes... it went beyond odd, certainly. It was, in fact, a major, major... coinkydink. Unsettling. Mike had a strange, almost innate suspicion of inexplicable coincidences, especially when a coincidence became coincidental in and of itself. That's when trouble began; that's when stuff began to gyrate out of control; that's when life became an endless, unstoppable loop of deja vu, like looking at a mirror-image of a mirror, watching the self-replicating reflections disappearing down the black hole of eternity... this was precisely the kind of thing that made Big Mike nuts.\nHaving it occur inside his hotshot I've Arrived-mobile made it worse. He felt that his LS8 lease ought to preclude, in fine print, such assaults on his delicate psyche.\nHe switched the radio off, mopped his brow with his monogrammed shirt sleeve, turned to his passenger, changing social gears, cranking up his smoothie salesman persona, breaking the ice with a vaguely nervous cackle: \"Well, so, doc... have you... you rocket scientists... have you come up with the meaning of life, yet?\"\nBen Berber was scrawling in a notepad; gauzy fabric from his toga fluttered in the air-conditioned updrafts. As Mike glanced over, it appeared that ben Berber was doodling dozens of smiley faces across a printed page filled with trigonometric functions.\n\"How's dot?\" replied the African, capping his pen, twisting his finely-carved lips into a bemused grin. \"Meanin ob life? Sure ting, buddy. No mystery to dot. Pipple are nuttin but survival vehicles for dere DNA. Gene machines. Subsidized housin. Dot's dot.\"\n\"Huh? \"\n\"Why, de meaning ob life... iss more life.\"\nThe stench of garlic and strange Moorish spices was sharp and offensive in the controlled climate of the Lincoln, and it increased geometrically every time Abu ben Berber opened his mouth. Big Mike, who normally discouraged smoking in his vehicle, was grateful when ben Berber lit up a thin, effeminate Gauloise. Mike's mind began to wander back to Ashland Avenue, and he quickly tried to focus elsewhere, anywhere; on his golf swing, on the clouds overhead, on the stream of morning commuters driving automobiles less pricey than his, on the billboards that lined the expressway. Directly opposite, a huge sign promoted a local strip club, and featured an illustration of a sanguine, half-naked giantess named Macon Bacon with a prominent Hot Stuff tattoo between her breasts.\nMeanwhile, orange construction barrels sprang up along the expressway shoulder, and traffic began to grind to a standstill. A vintage Econoline wedged into his sight line, blocking his view of the \u00dcber stripper's story-high cleavage. Which was just as well. Sex was not an easy subject for Mike; hence his obsession with it. He was grateful for the interruption. Except that, on the side of the van, spattered with road debris and plaster dribbles, was the logo for Red Devil Spackling Company, Inc. and it featured a little Satanic mascot which was identical to the one that had been snuggling in Miss Macon's solar plexus.\nMike felt chills skitter along his spine like a squirrel on a tension wire, and tried to clear his thinking. This was nothing, he reasoned, just perplexing, though statistically plausible chance; hardly beyond the realm of numerical quirks. Yet, when he tried to play Samaritan, allowing the van to merge in front of him, he found himself staring at the construction flagman, who was in fact an obese, hard-hatted, construction flag woman, wearing a filthy t-shirt that read, 'Little Nick's Take'n'Bake Gourmet Pizza' and bore the same, tiny, grinning, cutesy Lucifer laughing up a private storm between her bovine, doughy breasts... Suddenly, Big Mike punched the brake, and the Lincoln's suspension drew to a lock-free halt, an inch away from the spackling van's rear bumper. He turned to apologize for his lapse of concentration, but Dr. ben Berber appeared oblivious to the sudden stop; he was back at his scratch pad, making hurried notations, considering them furiously through narrow eyes, stroking a wispy moustache that looked like it was drawn on with a Bic finepoint. In a second, however, he became aware that Big Mike was gaping in his direction, trying to see his notebook.\n\"Yes, buddy?\"\nBig Mike chose not to become irritated by ben Berber's constant, idiotic use of the too-familiar term, 'buddy'; possibly, he reasoned, 'buddy' was African for 'Sir'. \"Doc, you're a brain-trust sort of guy, aren't you? What do you know about... I don't mean this to sound off the wall or anything, understand; I'm just killing a little time 'cause we're stuck here and all... but do you know anything about... you know, coincidences?\"\n\"Well, buddy, you might say dot de question isself iss coincidence; I did my pos' doctoral graduate work in Emergent Computation at de Bou Arfa Laboratory for Particle Physics in de Holy City of Agboville.\"\nWhatever. Big Mike felt unusual surges of energy ripple through his body; his muscles were twitching like he'd guzzled forty cups of espresso. Every cell felt individually sensitized. His heart was doing Olympic-quality somersaults. \"What I'm getting at, doc, is... What the hell are they supposed to be all about? From a scientist's point of view...?\"\nBen Berber continued to manipulate his Little Richard moustache. He cleared his throat, a losing propostion, threw back his head and closed his eyes. He said nothing for a long time, and Mike assumed he'd fallen asleep, and cursing quietly, glanced down at the smoldering Gauloise cigarette, hoping the Lincoln's subdued, luxurious interior survived it. He returned his focus to the road, where work crew was busy closing all lanes, including the one that merged into the Airport exit. In a moment, ben Berber began to speak, his girlishly-pitched and cluttered speech rhythms contrasting with the honey-sweet hum of the Lincoln's eight idling cylinders: \"Coincidence arise from de turmoil ob quantum variability, you know; from random hiccups in de void. It be a disparity betwin expectation and observation, yah? We hab tendency to reject numbers or juxtapositions which appear to us as absurd or unlikely...\" Against the engine's harmony, ben Berber's hideous vocal vibrations became sort of mesmerizing, like high beams to a doomed jackrabbit... \"You, buddy, wid tree pounds ob grey matter poking out ob your spine like a fockin carnation... you expect chaos, and when you get order, it mek you onn-comfortable...\"\nObnoxiously phrased, but... exactly right. Big Mike braced his right hand against the wood-grain of the dashboard binnacle in order to quell the jitters. His heart rate slowed drastically, suddenly; down to the mid-thirties. It was a good thing that the road was log-jammed just then; he doubted that he could control his limbs well enough to drive. Dr. ben Berber went on, eyes twinkling : \"My work in Spez involve de creation of abstract systems on compooters, measurin how dey change wid time. Surprisingly, it seem dot outta chaotic beginnins, given time, random patterns will always appear... large, coherent substructoors... totally spontaneously... order from chaos... it appear related to nature's tendency to mek patterns. Wot dis mean iss...\" Ben Berber drew a fierce breath, as if to emphasize his cardinal point: \"Collectively, reality appears to hab an agenda..\" Berber capped the suggestion with a series of disgusting, inappropriate grunts, gargling on a wad of phlegm. He tossed his cigarette stub onto the carpeted floorboards and ground it out with his pointed toe. \"Coincidence iss manifestation ob unimaginably complex patterns... But, if chaos hab a tendency to evolve into order... and if a system may become specialize to de point where it hab rendered isself unable to respond to de slightest fluctuation in circumstance... dot's big trouble.\"\nMesmerizing or not, Dr. ben Berber had lost his audience in the ozone of theoretical physics. He framed the thing again, gesturing with his tapering fingers, phrasing his point in such a way that he figured even a half-baked Anglo salesman could catch on. \"When I was leetle boy, in my village ob Abwong Fangak, we raised only Zombo goats. Bes' hide, bes' milk, dese Zombo goats. Dot's all de village elders wanted to hear 'bout, Zombo, Zombo, Zombo. I wass only four years ole, I tell dem, no, great fadders, you need to raise many variety ob goat, Mersa, Molobo, Bouake, Tambacounda... Dey laugh at me! Leetle boy telling dem wot to raise! Den one day, a specialized strain ob anthrax wiped out de entire flock. All de elders starve. May Allah grant dem peace. You follow, buddy? Diversity recovers from disaster; de one-crop reality iss doomed.\"\nThe African settled into the fussy, adjustable seatback with a self-satisfied harrumph. It appeared that he'd spent his seed of intellectual conviviality, and not a moment too soon; Big Mike had no idea what he was talking about. Quantum variability? Zombo goats? Jesus H. Christ; the rich may be different, he thought, but these jigaboo computer geniuses came from a whole different cosmic blip. No doubt. An instant later, Dr. ben Berber's preposterous voice came up again, his pitch gone higher and somehow more impassioned, more frenzied: \"Recall, de second law ob thermodynamics, my friend... entropy... suggests dat chaos be always increasin... But, dot law require an isolated system! In fact, if dere be no isolated systems, like de Buddhists say, den dot law be invalid...\"\nBig Mike realized that he'd inadvertantly yanked a finger from ben Berber's yap dike, a dangerous eventuality within the hermetically-sealed cockpit of a stopped car, and he risked the radio again, this time downshifting into sex-free AM territory; directly to WXMO; a safe, Christian-formatted station. Unfortunately, despite its diabolical moniker, Red Devil Spackling proved to be an eager sponsor on WXMO, and loosed steady jingles in between the sacchrine pop-gospel fluff... Red Devil Spackling Com-pan-ee, Been in business since Seventy three... We'll serve ya quick and serve ya well, We'll plaster up your walls, Sure as... heck! which was followed by an infomercial from the Red Devil owner... a man named 'Big Mike' Murphy... all of which was too coincidential, and therefore, too much a reminder of the whole cockamamie situation for Big Mike Doornbos to deal with. Off went the radio again, mid-megaHertz.\nUp ahead, the source of the bottleneck could now be seen; a backhoe had flipped over, and its great, hooked boom was sprawled across the highway like a dead diplodocus. It seemed that they might be in for an extended delay. Big Mike sighed heavily and shook out his arms. At least, the tingling in his extremeties had begun to dissipate; beat by beat, his trudging heart was returning to rhythmic normalcy.\nBen Berber lit another funny French cigarette and continued: \"Statistical mechanics be de study ob physiochemical phenomenon widin systems. Suppose mat'matics be a biological science.... only living tings encourage such statistical improbabilities. By teeory, life iss not only implausible, life iss impossible; everyting should all be completely focked op.... But... but... for zample, de chamber nautilus describe a spiral dat conform to a ratio of 1:1.618034., which can be extended to infinity. Dot's 'bout five decimal places too precise to be a 'coincidence', buddy. Somet'in' mighty strange be comin'down wid dat nutty leetle seashell! Iss dis a cosmic conspiracy? Or wot? I put it concisely: De universe iss alive! You t'ink this is all serendipitous? Happy chance? Numerical coherence? Unnatural instability pluckin poofect order from total chaos? Wot be de chance dat you be you? All dem sperm cells in your poppa's wankle, all dem eggs in big momma's squish... Astronomical coincidence! Ancient wisdom of de Tatamedanine pipple in Abwong Fangak suggest dat if dis coincidence hadn'ta happen, you wouldn't be around to notice nuttin. But dot's a circular argument wot ignore certain constants, which be de bedrock of physics... Odderwise, you be at a loss to explain your uniqueness in a universe ob mediochrities...\"\nThe incessant drone of Dr. Berber's accent, the obscurity of his postulation, his crude references to Doornbos gentitalia, the eternal gobs of throat butter surfacing in his gullet, became suddenly intolerable, and Big Mike veered the Lincoln onto the shoulder of the expressway, upsetting a couple of barrels, nearly sideswiping the guard rail, darting amid a gaggle of narcoleptic grunts with picks and shovels, shooting around the moribund tractor, and circumventing the whole traffic clot all the way to the airport exit. He pointed at his Sieko Kinetic, as if to indicate that they mustn't be late. His face took on the sort of road rage flush that gave him a fairly non-contested path between the other commuters. Teeth showing, voice a decibal or two above what was necessary, he barked, \"No harm meant, doc, but what the fuck does bedrock physics got to do with anything? My question was about coinkyd... coincidences.\"\n\"Shoor ting, buddy, tek it easy, dis be only conjecture! Dot's de ting! 'Cause de hooman brain can't resist findin patterns, even when dere iss none. If real coincidence happen in de mestastable region ob life, den it might trigger phase transition troo out the rest ob reality. Testable predictions would indicate dot when true coincidence begin to snowball, de end ob everything we understand be near at hand... because dere will be a chain reaction, increasin wid exponential speed, unstoppable and unimaginably vast... de inter-relation ob everything iss no longer deniable...!\"\nBig Mike whipped through a couple traffic lights, arrived at the airport, hammered around a stretch Hummer, the most ludicrous vehicle produced since Le Car, and cut off a Park'n'Go van in front of the international terminal. He was excruciatingly anxious to get the stinky know-it-all out of his Lincoln, out of his life. He popped the lid of the trunk, which contained Dr. Berber's luggage. \"You know what doc, I'm not sure if you're totally full of shit or what. But I tend to think so. Forgive my candor... I might not be the smartest guy that every lived, but I'm not the stupidest either. That junk just sounds... crazy.\"\n\"Oh yah, I'm pretty easy wid de notion dat I might be wrong. So, before I go, we do de ole ESP experiment to fine out...\" He closed his spiral notebook with a whap. \"What pitcha do I hab been drawin' on dis paper pad? Tek a chance and guess, buddy! Guess right, iss spooky coincidence, maybe de beginnin' ob de end! Guess wrong, we all saved from Armageddon!\" Dr. Berber clutched the pad against the Greek folds of his garment. \"Guess!\" he demanded with a parrot-like titter.\n\"Happy face?\" replied Big Mike miserably, unloading suitcases into the arms of a blatantly drunk, middle-aged porter.\n\"Big dummy! Big dummy!\" Dr. ben Berber threw his head back like a cartoon horse, chortling merrily. \"You completely wrong! We be saved! Sanbat salam!

Well, it wasn't old, any older than the air outside was, but it had a different feel. The air was damp and warm, as if it had stepped into a time machine and came to the future.\nThe antique shop was the only store on the block that had not suffered from the capitalism of the century. It stood around the other buildings where people in ties and business suits simply sat behind a desk all day, making more money than you or I, and living the good life in such a way that it appears that they are simply more equal than us.\nThe shop had stood against time and Big Business for a long time and John Desmond found it quite a relief that he could take a step back in time and actually relax for a change. His mind was racing and he tried frantically to place society on the back burner for a while and actually become interested in the items in the store.\nIt was dark, compared to the outside. Sunlight poured through a window with a simple drape pulled over it that did a lousy job of filtering out the sun's rays. A few old lamps stood lit in each corner of the shop. Hanging from the ceiling, which just cleared John's head, were several lights that had been homemade.\nThe shop, though dimly lit, had much to interest John. He walked around the shop, until he noticed the man staring at him. The man was older than he was by at least fifty years, and had whiter skin from years of staying indoors. He did not look unhealthy. He rose as he saw John and smiled.\n\"Pleasant day,\" the man said. John smiled and said that he agreed. The way the man warmly invited him into his shop and did not press the man automatically to buy something showed a contrast with the outside.\n\"Looking for anything in particular?\" the man asked.\n\"Nothing really. Well, I'm a collector of old books.\"\n\"Okay... er...\" The man realized that John had no idea where to go, and led him to the area behind the back wall of the shop that held the books. John smiled. The man was unlike the clerks in department stores, who just simply directed you to an isle and stood there. The man took John straight to the area where the books were and helped him sift through them.\nJohn poked through the box, looking at book after book until he came to the book with the pure wooden cover, varnished. It appeared to be brand new.\n\"Oh dear,\" said the man,\" that book always winds up back here. It shouldn't be here.\" But John had already opened the cover.\n\"THE STORY OF JOHN DESMOND, BY DESTINY.\"\nJohn simply stood there, reading his name over and over, awestruck.\n\"A great many lives have been lost over that book, my friend,\" said the man. John was not listening. He turned the page and read.\nYes, his worst fears were realized. The book was about him and him alone. Down to every painstaking detail of his life, how he was born. And although he did not dare read the rear of the book, he knew it also would tell him how he died.\n\"I'll take this,\" said John. The man shook his head.\n\"I'm warning you, my friend. This book is not for you.\" John scrambled to pull money out of his pocket.\n\"Will a hundred dollars do?\" The man threw his arms into the air.\n\"I really need the money,\" he said,\" but I-\"\n\"Two hundred dollars?\"\n\"No, a hundred. I don't want to cheat an honest man. One hundred dollars, yes, but be sure to return the book for a refund when you're done.\"\n\"If the book is about me,\" said John,\" I will keep it.\" The man shook his head and smiled.\n\"The book has been returned some sixteen times in the past decade,\" he said,\" and as I said, I really should not be giving you this.\" John smiled, gave the man a hundred dollars, and walked back into civilization.\nSo what if it told him how he died? He asked himself this question over and over and over. But then he asked himself the real clincher.\nWho is Destiny and how does this person know so much about me?\nJohn went home.\n\"Honey,\" he told his wife, Jean, as he walked in the door,\" you won't believe what I-\"\n\"Sorry, honey,\" said Jean, quickly, holding the baby Jessica and holding hands with James,\" I've got to drop of Jessica at the day care center and give James to Joseph's house so they can play and bring the suits to the dry cleaning place and take my mother out food shopping and get dinner from the local shop to bring home and make dinner.\" And even as she said this, Jean was out the door and rushing for the minivan.\n\"Eh... Love you, too, honey.\"\nWalter Cunningham came over as he usually did, about ten minutes later, with two beers and a newspaper.\n\"Nice day, John,\" said Walter. \"Nice day to relax.\" Walter was about John's age, but wiser, smarter, and richer. Walter had never married, hit upon something on the Internet early in life and spent the rest of the days of his life doing what he needed to do, not what society told him to do. More money? He didn't need it.\n\"What's wrong, John?\" Walter asked him when he noticed that something was bugging the man.\n\"Nothing,\" John replied, afraid that if he told Walter about the Book, that the Book would disappear.\n\"Come on,\" Walter said,\" you can't fool your friends. You can fool mom once, but you can't fool me.\" John told Walter to wait one second and then got the Book.\n\"What is it?\" Walter asked, taking the Book, hefting it, and putting down his beer.\n\"Me,\" said John with much hesitation.\n\"Well, I'll be-\" Walter said, reading John's name and closing the cover.\n\"Your life,\" he said.\n\"Who is Destiny?\" asked John.\n\"The theory of Destiny is that nothing is changeable. That means that whatever you read about in this book has already happened and everything that happens to you in the future has already been written down in this Book.\n\"So you're basically saying that I'm not in charge of my life?\"\n\"Whoa, wait a second,\" said Walter, giving John back the Book,\" that's what the theory says. I don't say that. This book is proof that you can change the future.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"Well,\" Walter said, trying to compose a direct and understandable answer,\" read the Book. It will tell you mistakes that you have made in your life and what mistakes you will make in your life. You can change them.\"\n\"That's what you believe,\" said John.\n\"That's what I believe,\" Walter said, taking a sigh. It was almost as if he hoped he believed what he was saying. He looked at John with a quizzically odd expression.\n\"What do you believe?\"\n\"All I know is that I found this book in the antique shop in the square.\"\n\"You found this there?\" Walter said with obvious shock and distaste. \"How odd. And quaint.\"\n\"Yes,\" said John, not knowing what the word quaint' meant. \"What do you think I should do?\"\n\"Talk to your wife about this. If she'll listen.\"\n\"She'll wear herself out yet. She's always on the go.\"\n\"I know,\" said Walter,\" I never got caught up in the rush. Well, make her read the book. Better yet; throw it away. Don't read what happens to you.\" Walter nodded. He changed his mind about wanting John to read it. Blast it! His thoughts raced through his head. What do you want me to do? He spoke to thin air, but received no answer.\n\"Why not?\" asked John. Walter scrambled together an answer.\n\"There is also a theory,\" he said quickly,\" that man should never know his own destiny.\"\n\"Well,\" said John, reading the first page of the book,\" whoever said that certainly didn't write this book.\"\n\"Maybe she did, John, maybe she did. Maybe she wrote it to tempt the prying eyes, knowing that reading this book is like playing God.\"\n\"Playing God?\" asked John.\n\"Well, I don't want to sound idiotic, but if this book is real, than it proves, partially, the existence of God, and that playing God is wrong.\" The answer did not satisfy John.\n\"I think that sounds nuts.\"\n\"Yes, that's what many say. But I believe-\" He stopped. \"I'm not a preacher. Go inside, John, and make up your own mind.\" John hefted the book, swallowed the last of his beer, and parted with his friend.\nIt was some time later that John stopped crying.\n\"Jean... dies of a heart attack from overwork?\" He tried to stop the headache but found himself unable to. \"And I die shortly thereafter of a broken heart?\" He rose.\n\"What kind of a future is that?\" If he was asking the wind, he received no answer. He stopped and looked at the book.\n\"Destiny cannot be altered, eh?\" he asked as he cleaned the stock of the revolver. He placed a bullet in each hole, closed and spun the chamber.\n\"Yeah, God, you may have been right about one thing, and one thing only.\" He pointed the revolver at his head, putting the barrel snug up against his temple. \"We weren't made to know our own destiny.\"\nThere was a delicate sound of thunder and a thud as John's body hit the floor.\nIt was many hours later that Jean came home. Walter heard the screams and ran over to see what had happened, by some miracle not having heard the gunshot.\nIt was, however, too late.\nIt was three days later that Jean opened the Book with Walter and read about her husband. Three hundred and fifty pages had been in the book, and Walter had already been wondering about it. The Book had obviously not been altered in any physical way.\nJean and Walter opened the Book and found the last page. Halfway down the page, the print stopped. Jean and Walter read the final paragraph.\n\"And John went insane trying to figure out why his wife died of overwork, and not wanting to go on with his life knowing about where he would be going or where he would truly die, put a gun to his head and shot himself.\"\nBut what Walter had glanced at earlier was not there. The note that John had left about not wanting to die from heartbreak was not there, either. The pages were blank. Only a hundred and fifteen pages of the Book had been filled up, until John's death. The rest of the pages were white, blank, and empty pages that no one would ever know had print on them.\n\"God, maybe Destiny can be changed after all,\" Walter said, shaking his head while Jean cried uncontrollably.\nIt was the next day that Walter took the Book back to the shop.\n\"Yes, I knew it would happen,\" the old man said,\" and I warned him. But he didn't listen. No one ever does.\" He opened the book to the first page. \"Once anyone sees his or her name there, they automatically buy it.\"\nWalter stood there, in shock.\nThe name had been changed. Before, it had read:\n\"THE STORY OF JOHN DESMOND, BY DESTINY.\"\nBut now, it read:\n\"THE STORY OF WALTER CUNNINGHAM, BY DESTINY.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

Her eyes were blank. Clark 72047 was not certain his answer had registered in her mind; was not completely certain she had even heard him.\nHe rose from his seat in one fluid motion and put the notebook in the pocket of his utilicoat.\n\"Thank you again,\" he said and left.\nOnce outside he activated his directional program and began making his way rapidly toward the offices of the United Planets News Service. It took him exactly 15.464 minutes to reach the building where the UPNS planetary bureau was located.\nHe ascended to the 39th floor, stepped off the elevator, and walked into the UPNS newsroom. Twenty-three other android reporters were busy sending stories to the news service's planetary editor. After editing they would be posted on the service's various cybersites. Each time a reader on any of the 17 planets in the Confederation pulled up one of those stories, UPNS received a credit.\nIt was a simple and very effective system, one that had been in operation since the earliest days of mass computer usage on Earth.\nClark 72047 began processing his story. It was an all-too-familiar one: A woman, a widow, had gone to her job and left her young child in the care of a neighbor. She had returned home to find the child gone and the neighbor lying unconscious on the floor near the door. The neighbor had been struck repeatedly on the head but was expected to live. The public order force had no leads at this point but the suspicion was that kidslavers had stolen the child. If that had indeed happened Clark 72047 knew there was almost no chance that the child would ever be found. At least not alive. She, for this time it was a girl who had been abducted, would be trained by the kidslavers. When she turned 12 or 13 the child would be sold to someone who had need of a servant or, if she was really beautiful, a compliant mistress. She would probably be well treated after she was sold. That was not because the buyers were particularly magnanimous. Rather it was a simple question of economics. The kidslavers sold their goods at a very high price. Their clients were wealthy, of course, but not so wealthy that they could mistreat a servant or mistress they had paid at least a million credits to own.\nThe kidslavers charged enormous amounts for the children they sold and well they should. If they were convicted of kidslaving death was the only punishment allowed by law. Of the nine kinds of death sentences handed out in the Confederation, the one that judges favored most for kidslavers was a very public and very long execution by whipping. A good executioner could keep a kidslaver alive for three and sometimes even four days while he worked at his craft. These executions were held in public places so passers-by could take the whip in their own hands and dole out a couple of lashes.\nClark 72047 finished processing his story. He then rose from his seat and went to the editor's office.\nThe editor, the only living UPNS employee on the planet, was bent over his desk reading something when Clark 72047 knocked on the doorjamb. The editor's eyestalks swiveled to find the android at the sound of the knock.\n\"Do you have anything else for me to do?\" Clark 72047 asked.\n\"Not at the moment,\" the editor said. \"I'll activate you if I do.\"\n\"Yes sir,\" Clark 72047 said and went back to his workstation.\nHe sat down behind his desktop and reached beneath it. His fingers found a long power cord and he plugged it into a small opening behind his left knee. His brain waves slowed and he drifted off into an android's version of sleep while his batteries charged.\nThere had been a time, long ago, when flesh-and-blood journalists wrote news. Earthers, Antarans, Denosians and all the other sentient beings of the Confederation had entrusted the gathering and reporting of information to their own kind.\nThere had been times on many of those planets when wars had even been fought for the right to leave newsgatherers free and unfettered.\nThat, too, had been long ago.\nNearly 500 years ago, however, that had all changed. The movement had started on Earth. Political leaders there grew tired of being asked what they believed were inappropriate and impertinent questions about their personal lives, their financial dealings, and other topics. They had begun a campaign to replace the flesh and blood reporters with androids.\n\"We need objectivity,\" they said at every opportunity. \"Human reporters can't be objective. They refuse to be objective.\"\nThe people of Earth eventually lined up behind the politicians and soon the major corporations that owned the newsgathering organizations felt they had no choice but to comply with the public will. The first android journalists had been designed, built and put into service then.\nSoon other planets fell in line with the new movement and so it is that today every legitimate news organization uses only android reporters. Oh, there are still a few bandit news organizations operating underground. They employ flesh-and-blood reporters and post lurid stories on cybersites that constantly shift their positions to avoid being shut down by the authorities. They attract very few readers, however.\nThe fact is Confederation citizens have long been raised with the idea that objectivity is the sole standard of journalism. They expect the news they read to be written in flat, unemotional sentences. Android cyber-vid reporters are even programmed to speak only in flat, unemotional tones so that there can be no rising inflections or somber notes in their news deliveries.\nLive beings are still needed in newsrooms, of course. Androids can report news but someone has to tell them where to go and who to see. Someone has to scan the official cybersites and pick out those items that will be of the most interest to readers. So it is that a few Earthers, Denosians, Flinskortiani, and other flesh-and-blood Confederationists still manage to find jobs with news organizations. They are trained not as journalists of old were but as advertising and marketing staffs had once been trained. They are taught to seek out stories based on a single criterion: Will it get a lot of clicks?\nEditors have no problem with that. After all, the more clicks a story gets the more credits their parent companies make. The more credits the parent companies earn, the more the editors are paid. Truly great editors Ruhal go Tim of Antares Prime, for example earn so much that they live like royalty.\nA slight buzz intruded upon Clark 72047's rest period and his eyes snapped open instantly. He reached behind his knee and unplugged the power cord then stood and walked quickly to the editor's office.\n\"Just got a scan. The public order forces found the abducted girl you wrote about. Dead. Throat slit,\" the editor said. \"Her body was found in an abandoned warehouse. She'd been killed apparently because the kidslavers ran a routine diagnostic on her and discovered she had some hereditary physical dysfunction. For the prices they get for their merchandise they can't sell their customers damaged goods. Of course they couldn't just turn her loose either. You never know what a kid might see. She might have been able to tell the detectors where she'd been taken or describe her abductors in some way. The kidnappers probably figured they had no choice but to kill her.\"\nClark 72047 stored the information in his brain. Androids do not need to write things down in notebooks, of course. They carry them when dealing with the general public to comfort the people they interview. Androids look exactly like the people on the planets they work on but everyone knows that all journalists are machines and there are still some who remain uncomfortable with that fact. Thus, small touches like a notebook or a slight physical deformity such as a limp help to put the people the androids interview at ease. Clark 72047 would not be dealing with the general public on this story, however. His assignment was only to log the official statement from the public order force personnel at the scene of the child's murder. The POF personnel were used to dealing with android reporters. A notebook would, therefore, be unnecessary.\nThe editor gave Clark 72047 the address and the android left immediately.\nHe arrived at the murder scene 30.672 minutes later an accident in which five had died was responsible for the delay. In the old days a flesh-and-blood reporter would have stopped to cover that story but androids only go to the assignments they have been given and then return. If the editor heard about the accident that delayed Clark 72047 he would assign another android to cover it. If not it would pass unnoticed. Either way it was of no importance to Clark 72047.\nThere had been a time when reporters were treated with suspicion by public order forces. That had been true on virtually every planet. No longer. Public order forces now allow journalists free rein at a crime scene because they know the androids will only report what they are told to report. There will never be any embarrassing questions from android journalists if the public order forces blow an investigation.\nClark 72047 walked through the barricade erected around the warehouse and introduced himself to the public information officer standing next to a detector.\n\"Clark 72047? Oh yes, I remember you,\" the PIO said. \"We met at the scene of that fire over in J-Town. About a year ago, I think.\"\n\"Yes, 11 months and 23 days ago,\" Clark 72047 said. \"You are well sir?\"\n\"Very well indeed,\" the PIO said.\nHe took a small golden disk from his coat pocket and said, \"excuse me.\"\nThe android raised his right arm. The PIO inserted the disk into a slot just below what would have been Clark 72047's fourth rib if, in fact, the android had a ribcage.\n\"That's the official statement,\" the PIO said after the android had downloaded all the information on the disk and it had popped back out of the slot. \"I've also included some background on the mother and some statistics about the number of times an abduction ends in death.\"\n\"That is rare, is it not sir?\" Clark 72047 asked.\nThe PIO's eyebrows raised slightly at the question.\n\"Why yes, it is,\" the PIO said.\n\"Generally, kidslavers spend several weeks stalking the children they abduct. They do that to establish the family's life patterns so they know the best time to carry out the abduction, of course. They also use that time to research the child. As a result they generally know in advance if the child they plan to kidnap is healthy and if there are any latent personality problems or genetic defects that might come to the fore later in life. So many things can go wrong during an abduction that the last thing kidslavers want to do is waste their time stealing a child they'll later have to kill,\" the PIO added by way of explanation.\nClark 72047 nodded.\n\"Thank you sir,\" the android said. \"Is there anything else?\"\n\"No,\" the PIO said and turned back to the detector. \"Nothing else.\"\nClark 72047 activated his directional program and headed back to the office.\nOnce there he processed his story and sent it to the editor who gave it only a cursory look he was, after all, paid to pick the stories he sent his android staff out to cover, not to actually read them.\nWhat would be the point of reading them anyway? The androids always wrote perfectly objective stories and they were always grammatically correct. They never even misspelled a word no matter what language they were writing in.\nAfter he glanced at it the editor posted the story of the girl's murder on the various UPNS cybersites.\nClark 72047, after determining that there were no other immediate assignments, returned to his desk and began recharging his batteries.\nThe faint buzzing sounded in his brain and his eyes snapped open again. His internal timepiece program told him that 1.338 days had passed.\nHe unplugged himself and went to the editor's office.\n\"Sir?\" he asked as he stood in the doorway.\n\"Is it true that you asked a public order force PIO a question after you downloaded the official statement?\" the editor asked.\n\"Yes,\" Clark 72047 replied.\nThe editor rubbed a seven-fingered hand over his smooth scalp. He wore a strange expression on his face. It was composed equally of exultation and worry.\n\"Then we have a problem I think,\" the editor said.\n\"Sir?\" Clark 72047 asked.\n\"Well on the one hand your story is being read damn near Confederation wide. It's gotten way more clicks than any other story in the past 50 cycles,\" the editor said. \"Corporate is very pleased by that.\"\nThe editor ran a hand over his head again and then rubbed his right cheek and his narrow chin.\n\"On the other hand the PIO has registered a complaint with Corporate and the courts. Seems he didn't like being quoted about the fact that kidslavers usually stalk their victims ahead of time. That bit about them researching a victim before they make the abduction was not meant for public consumption,\" the editor said.\n\"I do not understand the nature of the complaint. If he did not want it known he should not have told me,\" Clark 72047 said. \"The information is valid. It serves a public purpose because it warns parents of the modus operandi of the kidslavers and it is earning credits for Corporate. The complaint seems to be without foundation.\"\nThe editor's eyes widened slightly at Clark 72047's response. The words \"public purpose\" stuck in his mind. What had that to do with anything? Still, the android was right. There was no doubt that the information was valid androids are incapable of misquoting anyone. And he was right on another count as well: The story was earning one helluva lot of credits.\n\"Well, there will have to be a trial on the complaint,\" the editor said. \"To the best of my knowledge there never has been a complaint like this before. Not on this planet anyway. It will take some time to sort out all the procedures. In the meantime Corporate has ordered me not to send you out on any more stories until this whole thing is resolved.\"\nClark 72047 nodded his head slightly.\n\"Is there anything else?\" he asked.\n\"No, nothing else. I'll buzz you when we figure out what's going to happen with the trial,\" the editor said.\n\"Sir,\" Clark 72047 said and left the editor's office. He returned to his workstation and began recharging his batteries yet again.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

It was apparent that the editor had been working long hours, something he was not accustomed to doing. Clark 72047 did not wonder why the editor had been working long hours. He had not been told to wonder why. He merely noted it.\n\"Since you've been off-line a great deal has happened,\" the editor said. \"There have been many protests in the streets.\"\nClark 72047 accessed his memory banks for a definition of the phrase \"protests in the streets.\" His memory banks told him that in ancient times humans and other creatures had sometimes expressed their dissatisfaction with government or some major corporation by marching in the streets. His memory banks did not tell Clark 72047 what the marchers hoped to achieve by this since many of them were arrested during those demonstrations. Additionally, some were beaten, some gassed and, occasionally, a few were shot. There was no record of such \"protests in the streets\" in over 300 years, however.\n\"Does this concern me sir?\" Clark 72047 asked.\n\"It does,\" the editor said.\n\"How, sir?

She went to them and demanded to know why they had never told parents about this before, never warned them,\" the editor said.\n\"The local public order force commander told her it was none of her business,\" the editor continued. \"He told her to go home.\"\nThe editor's mouth turned into a perfect circle, a rueful smile for one of his species.\n\"That was the very worst thing he could have done,\" the editor said. \"The little girl was apparently very well liked in her neighborhood and when the mother went home and told people how she had been treated? well, the neighbors got angry.\"\nThe android said nothing.\n\"Anyway, a group of the neighbors went to the local public order force facility. It's unclear what they wanted. Some, of course, wanted to know why the information about the kidslavers stalking children had been withheld. Others said they wanted an apology for the mother. There were half a dozen other reasons given as well,\" the editor said.\nClark 72047 listened impassively as the editor explained that a detachment of public order force personnel armed with neural batons had charged into the group gathered in the street outside the facility. The crowd had dispersed. No official statement had been issued and so no news organizations had covered the demonstration.\nBut the news had leaked out anyway.\nSome protesters used their personal computers to tell friends and relatives what had happened. Some witnesses to the event did as well, the editor said. Others just told everyone they met about the demonstration and what had happened when the public order forces had charged. Before long the entire planet and half the Confederation knew of the incident. More protests were organized around the planet. More clashes with public order forces resulted. No news organizations covered these clashes but word continued to spread. Unlike android journalists would have had they been told to write about these incidents, the flesh-and-blood protesters did not simply report the news of these demonstrations when they wrote and spoke to people. They interpreted it. They drew conclusions after retelling the details of the incident. Worse, they asked each other a lot of questions. Because there were no official answers to those questions the protesters and others speculated about what the answers might be. Soon, those speculative \"answers\" were incorporated into the retelling of each incident as if they were true. More protests followed before long as the stories grew more lurid. The planetary public order force commander had finally issued an official statement in an effort to quell the protests. However two android reporters - one from InterConFedNews and the other from Solar News Corp. - had followed their objectivity programming to the letter and sought balancing comments from protesters. Given an opportunity to respond, the protesters had stopped a hair short of calling the public order force commander a liar.\n\"The stories those two journalists posted were sensational,\" the editor said with a certain amount of distaste. \"But I'll say this, they were read avidly. An unbelievable number of readers throughout the Confederation clicked onto them. Before long transports of Antarans were arriving at spaceports around the planet. They came to march in solidarity with people here. That's what they said, anyway. It didn't take long for protesters from other planets to arrive here to do the same thing. Worse, people throughout the Confederation began asking questions of their own security forces. The whole Confederation is in an uproar now.\"\nThe editor looked at Clark 72047. His mouth was set in a perfectly straight line, a sign of bewilderment.\n\"All because you asked a question,\" he said. There was wonder in his voice.\nClark 72047 processed this information. He said nothing.\n\"At any rate, your trial is today. The judge has set the time for 60 minutes from now. I will accompany you,\" the editor said. \"I may be asked some questions as well but I'm afraid I won't be much help to you if that happens. I have no idea why you asked that question. I assumed when I put the story on our cybersites that it was something the public information officer had told you of his own accord. I did not realize that he was responding to a question from you.\"\nClark 72047 nodded.\n\"I understand,\" he said.\n\"Come on,\" the editor said. \"We'll use the shuttle to get there.\"\n\"We can take public conveyances and still arrive in time,\" Clark 72047 said. \"Surely that is in keeping with Corporate Directive 98765-a which states that public conveyances are to be used whenever possible to save money.\"\nThe editor's mouth expressed a grim smile.\n\"We cannot do that,\" he said.\n\"Sir?\" Clark 72047 asked.\n\"You'd be mobbed. You're a damned celebrity now,\" the editor said.\n\"I don't understand sir,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"No,\" the editor replied thoughtfully, \"I don't guess you do. Let me explain it this way. Word has gotten out about the PIO's complaint. People have also found out that you asked him the question after you had already downloaded the official statement. You have become something of a hero to the protesters as a result. They even have a nickname for you.\"\n\"A nickname?\" the android asked.\n\"Yes, the reference is pretty obscure. I'm told that it dates back to the late 20th Century on Earth. A place known as Washington. Something to do with a leader who was forced to resign in disgrace. They're calling you 'Woodstein the Truth Machine.' I don't have a clue as to what that refers to but there are a lot of intellectuals among the protesters. You know the kind I mean; the agitators. I suppose they know what the hell it means,\" the editor said.\n\"That does not explain why we must violate the corporate directive on public conveyances,\" the android said.\nExasperated, the editor ran a hand across the top of his smooth head.\nHe pointed to the window behind his desk.\n\"There's a thousand or more people out there in the street demanding that you be activated to write more stories,\" the editor said. \"Somehow word leaked out that you had been de-activated until the trial and people just began forming outside the office on a daily basis. Twice now we've had to call the public order force to have them removed from the newsroom. They were trying to activate you themselves. Now they just stand outside chanting 'Free Woodstein the Truth Machine, Free Woodstein the Truth Machine' over and over.\"\nHe sighed.\n\"If we go out and they see you there will be a scene such as you have never witnessed before,\" the editor said.\n\"That's why,\" he added, \"we're taking the shuttle.\"\n\"I understand,\" Clark 72047 said and followed the editor out of the newsroom and into the elevator. At the 97th floor they exited the elevator and boarded the shuttle. They lifted off and cruised toward the Justice Hall. Exactly 3.456 minutes later they landed on the Justice Hall's roof and Clark 72047 followed the editor into another elevator.\nThey made their way to the designated floor and walked into the courtroom. Three lawyers from Corporate were on hand but they made it clear that they were only there to protect the company's interests should that be necessary. They were not on hand to help Clark 72047.\n\"I understand,\" the android told the lawyers.\nA court attendant led Clark 72047 to a long table in the front of the courtroom. The android sat down and looked to his left. The PIO who had filed the complaint sat at a similar table along with three other men. They were dressed in the distinctive uniforms of high-ranking public order force officials. There was another man standing nearby. He was dressed in the scarlet and black robes of the public prosecutor's office.\n\"Rise!\" the court attendant said and everyone in the courtroom stood as the judge entered.\nClark 72047 noted that the judge was a Diskeli female. He did not feel gladdened or saddened by that fact. He simply processed the information.\nEveryone sat.\n\"Does everyone here speak ConFed Standard?\" the judge asked in a heavily accented voice.\nEveryone said they did and the judge noted for the record that ConFed Standard was the language that would be used during the trial.\n\"I wish everyone to understand that this is an unusual trial in that, apparently for the first time anywhere, an android is the defendant,\" the judge said from her seat at the front of the courtroom. \"Nonetheless, we will observe the normal protocols.\"\nShe looked at the PIO.\n\"The plaintiff and his, um, what shall I call all of you seated with the plaintiff?\" she asked.\n\"If it please your honor, and for purposes of this trial only, perhaps it would be best to refer to us as the plaintiff's advisors,\" the man in the public prosecutor's robes said.\n\"Well and good,\" the judge said. \"Well and good. Now, the plaintiff and his advisors will be allowed to state his case. The android Clark 72047 will then be allowed to state its case. Each side will be permitted to cross-examine the other. Are there any questions?\"\nThe plaintiff and his advisors said they had none.\nClark 72047 indicated that he had none either.\n\"Proceed then,\" the judge said.\nThe plaintiff stood and approached the judge.\n\"Your honor,\" the PIO said, \"when I first filed my complaint I believed that this was a simple civil case. The android Clark 72047 had asked me an inappropriate question and then quoted me in a story. The United Planets News Service later sent that story to its cybersites. That made it available to readers throughout the Confederation. As I say, when I first filed my complaint I was only seeking compensatory damages for emotional distress.\"\n\"Duly noted,\" the judge said.\n\"Since then, your honor, my complaint has become a matter of far greater urgency. The fact is that because of that story there has been widespread civil unrest. The android's question has touched off a crisis in public confidence the likes of which have not been seen on this planet in centuries. Likewise, there have been reports of similar outbreaks of civil unrest on other planets as well,\" the PIO said.\n\"And your contention is?\" the judge asked.\n\"My contention is that all of this unrest can be laid at the feet of an android that malfunctioned during an interview at a murder scene,\" the PIO said. He glanced at Clark 72047 then pointed a finger in his direction. \"That android.\"\n\"And your recommendation, should this be found to be correct?\" the judge asked.\nThe PIO looked around, his eyes searching those of his advisors. The public prosecutor nodded slightly.\n\"Your honor, my recommendation would be that first the android Clark 72047 be taken off-line permanently. Second,\" the PIO said and licked his lips nervously, \"I seek the sum of 1.5 million credits for the emotional distress I have suffered as a result of this incident.\"\nAt that point the lawyers from Corporate stood and asked for permission to approach the bench.\n\"Denied,\" the judge said. \"You may speak if I find, in fact, that the android malfunctioned. The question of damages can only be determined at that time.\"\nThe lawyers from Corporate sat down.\n\"Is there anything else?\" the judge asked the PIO.\n\"No your honor. I believe that is the essence of this case,\" the PIO said.\n\"Clark 72047,\" the judge said.\n\"Your honor,\" the android replied.\n\"Are you represented by counsel?\" the judge asked.\n\"No I am not,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"You understand that you have a right to be represented,\" the judge said and cast a pointed look at the lawyers from Corporate. They, each in turn, glanced away.\n\"I do understand that your honor,\" the android replied. \"I am capable of defending myself in this matter. I am familiar with all the laws pertaining to a complaint such as this one and I am familiar with the circumstances of this incident. In addition, I should add that because I have value to Corporate it is my pre-programmed duty to remain functioning as long as possible. I will, therefore, present the best possible defense within the confines of the law.\"\n\"Very well then, you may state your case,\" the judge said.\n\"Your honor I have no case to state,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"Surely you have some evidence to dispute the PIO's charge,\" the judge said.\n\"No your honor, I do not,\" the android said. \"The facts in this case are not in dispute. I asked the PIO the question I am alleged to have asked him. He answered it and I put that answer into my story.\"\nThe judge looked at him for a long moment.\n\"Will you be examining the plaintiff?\" she asked.\n\"Yes your honor,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"All right then. This is very irregular but we shall proceed,\" the Diskeli said.\n\"Since the burden of proof in cases such as these lies with plaintiffs, it is customary to allow them to go first,\" she said.\nHearing no comment or objection the judge ordered Clark 72047 to stand in the witness box.\nHe did so.\n\"Your honor, may I allow one of my advisors to conduct this examination?\" the PIO asked.\n\"If Clark 72047 does not object it is so ordered,\" the Diskeli said.\n\"I do not object,\" the android said.\nThe public prosecutor rose then and advanced to the witness box.\n\"State your name for the record,\" he ordered the android.\n\"Clark 72047,\" the android replied.\n\"You are employed as a journalist for the United Planets News Service?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"No,\" the android answered.\nThe public prosecutor's face went blank for an instant and then slowly reddened.\n\"Do you, or do you not, work for UPNS?\" he asked.\n\"I do work for UPNS. It would be incorrect to say that I am employed by the news service, however,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"And why is that?\" the public prosecutor asked, a tinge of sarcasm in his voice.\n\"It is incorrect to say that I am employed by UPNS because I receive no pay for my work. I am, therefore, not employed by the corporation in any true manner of speaking,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"You are in no way compensated by the UPNS?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"No sir,\" the android replied. \"I am a machine. There is no need to pay me, feed me, or provide for either my physical or material comfort.\"\nAt the rear of the courtroom the lawyers from Corporate were busy scribbling notes as Clark 72047 spoke.\n\"How long have you been employ? er, I mean, how long have you worked for the UPNS?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"I have worked for UPNS on this planet for 125.972 years,\" Clark 72047 said. \"Before that, I was assigned to Mizin. I was refitted to look like the humanoid natives of this planet and then sent here as a temporary replacement for an android damaged at the scene of a story.\"\n\"A temporary replacement? It would seem to me that a job that lasts 125-plus years is more than a temporary assignment. Is that not so?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"Perhaps that is so in terms of a native of this planet where the lifespan averages 83.887 years,\" Clark 72047 said. \"My projected useful lifespan is well over 1,500 years, however. This is a temporary assignment in light of that fact.\"\nThe prosecutor seemed somewhat shaken by that answer. Clark 72047 did not know why nor did he care. It was of no importance.\n\"You admit that you asked the PIO a question after you had downloaded the official statement?\" the public prosecutor asked the android.\n\"Admitted,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"A question, sir,\" the judge said.\n\"Your honor?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"Is there anything illegal about an android doing that? Asking a question after it has downloaded an official statement, I mean,\" the judge said.\n\"Well, no,\" the prosecutor said. \"There has never been a need, until now perhaps, to address that issue. To the best of my knowledge it's just never been done.\"\nThe judge made a note.\n\"Thank you. Proceed,\" the Diskeli said.\nThe prosecutor turned back to Clark 72047.\n\"Why did you ask that question?\" he asked the android.\n\"I cannot answer that,\" Clark 72047 said.\nThe prosecutor seemed nonplused by that answer.\nHe turned to the judge.\n\"Your honor please order him to answer the question,\" the prosecutor said.\nThe judge turned her attention to Clark 72047.\n\"You must answer,\" she said.\nThe android turned to look at the judge.\n\"Your honor I am incapable of answering that question, at least in that form,\" he said.\n\"Explain,\" the Diskeli ordered.\n\"I am not a person,\" the android said. \"I am not attempting to lie or dissemble in any way. I am incapable of telling a lie in fact. It is true that some androids working for security services are programmed so that they can lie under certain circumstances. I do not work for a security service, however, and so I lack the ability to lie. I am a machine. I was built at the TeeGro Works on Mz Minor and put into service when I was purchased by the United Planets News Service. I cannot answer the prosecutor because I do not know why I asked that question.\"\nThe judge nodded.\n\"Try another tack,\" the judge said to the public prosecutor.\n\"Is there a virus infecting your programming?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"No,\" Clark 72047 replied.\n\"Can you be sure?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"Yes,\" the android replied. \"I run regular diagnostics and I am fitted with an anti-viral program. Additionally, I am thoroughly checked once a month by technicians employed by the TeeGro Works. It is part of the service contract that comes with every android from that company.\"\n\"Is there anything in your programming that orders you to ask a question once you have downloaded an official statement?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"There is not,\" the android answered.\n\"And yet you did,\" the prosecutor said.\nThe android said nothing.\n\"There must be a reason why,\" the prosecutor said.\nThe android remained silent.\n\"Your honor,\" the prosecutor said with a note of exasperation in his voice.\n\"Yes?\" the Diskeli asked.\n\"He is being unresponsive,\" the prosecutor said.\n\"In what way?\" the judge asked.\n\"He did not answer my last two questions,\" the prosecutor said.\n\"You did not phrase them as questions,\" the Diskeli said. \"You merely stated facts. As I understand the way this android works, statements of fact do not require it to respond unless there is some disagreement. In this, apparently, there is none.\"\nThe prosecutor looked bewildered. A human, an Antaran, even one of the legendarily cryptic inhabitants of Stru would have responded to his statements.\n\"Proceed with that in mind,\" the Diskeli said.\n\"And yet you did ask that question. What I wish to know is why you did despite the fact that there is nothing in your programming that requires you to do so. Why did you do it?\" the prosecutor asked, his voice rising in anger.\n\"I do not know,\" the android replied calmly.\n\"No further questions,\" the prosecutor said angrily.\n\"You may step down,\" the judge told Clark 72047.\nThe android did as he was told.\n\"Do you wish to examine the plaintiff?\" the judge asked.\n\"Yes,\" Clark 72047 said.\nThe PIO entered the witness box.\nClark 72047 walked to the box and stood about three feet from the PIO. He activated his most sympathetic voice program for it was clear that the PIO was agitated. Clark 72047, programmed to put people at ease, could not make him even more uncomfortable as a result.\n\"You are a public information officer for the public order force in this city?\" Clark 72047 asked.\n\"Yes,\" the PIO said.\n\"Did I ask you a question after I had downloaded your official statement concerning the murder of a child who had been stolen by kidslavers?\" the android asked.\n\"Yes,\" the PIO said.\n\"Did you answer it?\" the android asked.\n\"Well, um, yes I did,\" the PIO said.\n\"Thank you,\" the android said.\n\"But wait,\" the PIO said.\n\"Silence,\" the judge said.\nShe turned to face the android.\n\"Clark 72047 do you wish to let the PIO speak further?\" the Diskeli asked.\n\"Your honor I believe he has answered all of my questions. He is the man he says he is. He acknowledges that I asked him a question and that he answered it,\" the android said. \"I have no further questions of him.\"\n\"Step down,\" the Diskeli told the PIO.\n\"But your honor,\" the PIO said.\n\"Step down, sir,\" the judge said firmly.\nThe PIO stepped down, muttering beneath his breath.\n\"Now, if there are no other?\" the judge started to say but stopped when Clark 72047 raised his right hand.\n\"Yes?\" she asked.\n\"Your honor I should like to call two other witnesses,\" the android said.\n\"Yes? And who are they?\" the judge asked.\n\"My editor and one of the lawyers from Corporate,\" the android said.\n\"To what purpose?\" the judge asked.\n\"To establish the facts that I am incapable of telling a lie, that I have always quoted sources accurately and completely, and that I am thoroughly objective. I also wish it on the record that I have performed in an exemplary manner since coming on-line,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"Stipulated,\" the prosecutor said. \"Your honor we will stipulate to all those things.\"\n\"Clark 72047?\" the judge asked.\n\"Yes?\" the android asked back.\n\"Will you accept their stipulation?\" the Diskeli asked.\n\"I will your honor,\" the android said.\n\"Good,\" the judge said. \"Now then let us move forward to the summations. The plaintiff will go first.\"\nThe prosecutor stood, straightened his red and black robes and strode to the triangular-shaped area before the judge where summations are customarily delivered. He mounted the three steps that placed him just slightly below the judge's level.\nHe spoke for an hour, eloquently summing up the case. He spoke of the harm that had been caused by one simple question asked by an android reporter that had already downloaded an official statement. He spoke of the danger to the public order forces and to the institutions they served. Almost as an afterthought, he spoke of the danger to the citizenry of this planet and others.\n\"In conclusion, your honor, we ask you to find on behalf of the plaintiff not because laws were broken but because this inappropriate question has led to widespread unrest throughout the Confederation. We are talking not about an android's malfunction any more but the safety and security of millions of Confederated citizens. They no longer trust the public order forces. They march in the streets. If you do not find for the plaintiff in this case, your honor,\" the prosecutor said, \"we may never return to the tranquillity we have known for so many centuries.\"\nHe paused, looked at Clark 72047 and then turned his attention back at the judge.\n\"This is a unique case, your honor, not only because the defendant is an android but also because no written law has been broken. Still, your honor, something has been destroyed. Something has been broken in this instance. It was the people of our Confederation who exerted pressure on newsgathering organizations to employ? er, I mean, to use androids as journalists. And why was that? It was because those people had grown tired of an overly aggressive media that more often agitated than informed. It is that will that has been ignored here, that sense of propriety that has been violated. Because of that I beg you to weigh the fate of a self-described machine against the public good. A public trust has been violated and it is because of that, your honor, that I say if you do not find for the plaintiff there can be no doubt that this civil unrest will continue,\" he said.\nHe bowed low.\n\"I thank the court,\" he said and sat down.\nThe judge paused to make some notes. When she had finished she looked up.\n\"You may sum up Clark 72047,\" the judge said.\nThe android stood and moved to the same spot the prosecutor had occupied. He activated his most non-emotional voice program so that his words came out flat, without inflection.\n\"Your honor, I am accused of nothing in this case,\" he said.\n\"The public prosecutor said there is no law covering the asking of a question after an official statement has been downloaded. The plaintiff and his advisors stipulate that I cannot tell a lie, that I have performed in an exemplary manner throughout my existence, and that I am completely objective. It has been established that there is nothing in my programming that is defective,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"If there is blame to be attached to the crisis in public confidence that has followed the publication of a story I wrote 69.712 days ago it cannot lie with me. I am, as both the prosecutor and I have pointed out, a machine. I have no political agenda, no social agenda. I cannot do anything except what my programming tells me to do. That programming has been in existence for hundreds of years throughout the Confederated Planets. It has been refined constantly so that androids such as myself, in a totally objective manner, deliver the news to readers and viewers in exactly the format they wish to have it delivered to them. I do not say that it is right nor do I say that it is wrong for I have no opinion about that. I cannot have such an opinion. I am a machine.\"\nClark 72047 turned to regard the plaintiff and his advisors and then turned back to the Diskeli.\n\"The plaintiff and his advisors argue that I must be taken off-line because I have caused a crisis in public confidence. There have been street protests. People have been injured. People no longer trust the public order forces,\" the android said.\n\"That has nothing to do with me,\" Clark 72047 said. \"I am only the messenger in this instance. It was not I who abducted the little girl. It was not I who killed her. It was not I who answered the question but the PIO. If he did not wish to have that information circulate among the general population he should not have answered that question. I have no means to compel an answer from anyone.\"\nThe android paused to look around the courtroom.\n\"At this time I wish to correct a statement that the public prosecutor made earlier when he said that this planet has existed in tranquillity for centuries. There has long been a crisis in public confidence on this planet and it is not a particularly tranquil place for any but certain high-ranking government officials,\" he said when he resumed speaking. \"I have spent more than 125 years documenting the problems here. There have been murders. Children have been abducted and sold into lifelong slavery. Men and women have died needlessly because they could not afford health care. I have documented these incidents with complete objectivity time and again because that is what my programming dictates. Every story I have written has been assigned to me. I chose none of them because I do not operate with a free will. Nor can I tell a lie. Nor can I dissemble or shade meanings to achieve a desired political or social end. When I say this is not a tranquil place I say so based solely on observable fact. I cannot do otherwise. I am a machine. What public purpose is served by taking me off-line then? A tranquillity that did not exist before I wrote my story cannot be returned to no matter what the outcome of this trial.\"\nClark 72047 paused again.\n\"I have no fear of being taken permanently off-line. I have no concept of my own mortality. I exist only to work. When I am not working I am off-line. I do not eat. I do not drink. I work and then I do not work. I can do nothing else. And when I am working, I can do nothing but what my programming tells me to do,\" he said.\n\"The public prosecutor asked me if there was anything in my programming that demanded that I ask the PIO a question after I had downloaded the official statement. I replied truthfully that there is not. What he did not ask is if there is anything in my programming that orders me not to ask such a question. Had he, I would have replied truthfully that there is not,\" Clark 72047 said.\n\"There can only be one reason for that and it is rooted in my programming and in the programming of every android journalist. That reason must be that asking such questions will mean more readership. When we interview non-official people, such as the woman whose daughter was murdered, we obey our programming. That programming requires us to seek out those elements of the story that will best tell readers what is important about it. Why? Because then more people will read the story and the more people who read it the more credits Corporate earns,\" the android said.\n\"Therefore, your honor, I cannot say why I asked the PIO that particular question. I can say, however, that I can do nothing but obey my programming. I have no control over my programming. I cannot modify it. I did not help write it. I simply obey it,\" Clark 72047 said.\nHe paused.\n\"More than a thousand years ago, on Earth, a writer had one of his characters ask this question: 'If you prick me, do I not bleed?' In more than 125 years on this planet I have covered many stories, more than 1 million. Were I a native of this planet I would have been 'pricked' a million times by the suffering and death that I have chronicled,\" he said.\n\"And yet I have not 'bled' and disobeyed my programming in any way,\" the android said.\n\"I cannot. I am a machine.\"\nClark 72047 bowed low to the judge.\n\"I thank the court,\" he said and returned to his seat.\nThe judge stood then followed immediately by every being in the courtroom.\n\"I shall take this matter under advisement and return with my decision within the hour,\" she said.\nWith that she left the courtroom.","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

The editor and the lawyers from Corporate exited as well. The court attendant walked over to Clark 72047 as he sat alone at his table.\n\"I must be with the judge. Will you be all right here alone?\" the attendant asked.\n\"Yes,\" Clark 72047 said. \"I cannot be otherwise.\"\nThe attendant nodded and left.\nThirty minutes later the attendant hurried through the courtroom and out the door. Less than 10 minutes later the plaintiff, his advisors, the editor and the lawyers from Corporate returned and hastily took their seats. Once the attendant was certain that everyone who needed to be present was, he ducked into the judge's chambers. He emerged a few seconds later and said in a clear strong voice: \"Rise!\"\nEveryone stood as the judge entered the courtroom and sat behind her desk.\n\"Be seated,\" she said.\nEveryone sat.\n\"This is a most difficult case,\" the Diskeli said by way of preamble.\n\"On the one hand the defendant is guilty of no crime. By everyone's admission he did nothing against the law. He simply asked a question and reported accurately what was said to him. The plaintiff wishes him held responsible for emotional distress and for the civil unrest that resulted from that fact,\" the judge said.\n\"On the other hand we do have civil unrest, widespread distrust of public order forces and a spreading distrust of government in general. The plaintiff blames this on the defendant who responds, in kind, that he is not at fault essentially because he has been pre-programmed to perform in a certain way,\" the Diskeli said.\n\"Because the movement to replace flesh-and-blood reporters with androids originated on Earth it is to that planet's precedents that I have looked for guidance,\" the judge said.\nShe turned sad eyes toward Clark 72047.\n\"I am afraid, sir,\" she said, \"that Earth's history is full of examples in which jurists subjectively ruled that what they considered to be the public good was more important than a strict adherence to the law. In some cases those jurists limited the rights of plaintiffs to collect damages for the mistakes of doctors and manufacturers. In other cases those jurists actually ordered the execution of human beings for their beliefs because there was a public outcry against them.\"\nShe paused and looked down at her notes before looking up at Clark 72047.\n\"Based on those historical precedents it is the judgment of this court in this case, therefore, that you be taken permanently off-line. It is the further judgment of this court that the plaintiff be required to pay the United Planets News Service for the full cost of a replacement android. The court finds his argument for emotional distress unworthy. He, in fact, answered the question that was posed to him. The fault is his, therefore, and not the android's,\" the judge said.\nShe looked at Clark 72047.\n\"If you were a flesh-and-blood creature my ruling would have been different,\" she said. \"As you are not, however, and in accordance with the ample precedents from Earth's history, I feel that it is in the best interests of society at large that you be taken off-line. The public must believe that there was a programming error that caused you to malfunction even though there is no evidence to support that. It is my belief that civil order will return only when the public accepts that as the explanation. I know there is only cold comfort in this for you but I believe that taking you off-line will ultimately serve the greater good. I wish it were not so.\"\nClark 72047 looked back at her.\n\"I understand,\" he said.\n\"Your honor,\" the public prosecutor said. \"How, I mean, well, er, how is the android to be taken off-line? Is there a procedure?\"\n\"There is not,\" the judge said. \"I am ordering that Clark 72047 be taken to the TeeGro Works where he was assembled and there be disassembled. That is all that I know to order in this case.\"\n\"Your honor,\" the public prosecutor said.\n\"Yes?\" the Diskeli asked.\n\"Your honor, the PIO is a public servant and cannot afford to pay for a replacement android. One android would cost him at least 10 years' salary,\" the public prosecutor said. \"Can this order be modified?\"\nThe judge looked at the plaintiff and his advisors.\n\"No,\" the Diskeli said coldly. \"It cannot. Tell the PIO that he should have thought about that before he filed this complaint and then sought damages for emotional distress.\"\nShe was halfway to the door of her chambers when she paused and turned back to face the plaintiff and his advisors.\n\"Clark 72047 is blameless in this matter and yet he will suffer the android equivalent of an execution for the public good,\" the judge said to the PIO. \"Were I you I would not bother trying to appeal this order. Mortgage your personal residence if you must. Take on extra work. Turn to prostitution for all I care. You have brought this upon your own head.\"\nWith that she walked into her chambers and slammed the door.\nThe attendant walked over to the defendant's table with a pair of manacles in his hands.\n\"Those will not be necessary,\" Clark 72047 said. \"My programming is not such that I will try to escape. I will go with you quietly.\"\nThe attendant nodded and together they walked out of the courtroom and into an elevator.\nWhen they reached the Justice Hall's street level the attendant looked outside and shook his head. There was a mob milling about in the street. Many carried signs saying \"Free Woodstein the Truth Machine.\"\nThey were chanting \"Free Woodstein the Truth Machine\" over and over.\n\"How the hell did they know about this trial?\" the attendant asked.\n\"I do not know,\" the android said.\n\"Well, you're a celebrity,\" the attendant said. \"Somehow word always seems to spread more quickly when someone famous is brought here.\"\nThe android said nothing.\n\"Not much we can do except wait for the technicians from TeeGro to show up,\" the attendant said. He looked out at the mob. It seemed to be swelling.\n\"It's possible,\" the attendant said thoughtfully, \"that the judge was wrong. Taking you off-line might do more harm than good, at least as far as the public order force and government are concerned. What do you think?\"\nClark 72047 looked at the attendant then.\n\"I cannot say,\" the android said. \"My programming does not permit me to make such judgments. In matters such as these I can be nothing but objective. Speculation is not built into my programming and thus I cannot speculate about the effect of the outcome of this trial on the public order force and the government.\"\nThe attendant looked back at the android standing placidly next to him.\n\"You cannot or you will not?\" he asked.\n\"I cannot,\" the android said.\n\"Ever?\" the attendant asked.\n\"Never,\" the android replied.\nOutside the Justice Hall the mob's chanting was suddenly replaced with shouts and screams. A platoon of public order force personnel wearing body armor broke into the ranks of the crowd and began swinging neural batons. Stunned demonstrators immediately crumpled in the street.\nA wild melee broke out as some demonstrators, anticipating this response from the public order force, fought back with stolen neural batons and other weapons.\nThe attendant moved away from the glass doors.\nThe android remained standing close by the doors, however. His head swiveled from side to side as he observed protesters and public order force personnel battling one another.\nThere was a loud noise and the glass door shattered as a thrown object missed its target and went through it. The object, something metallic with sharp edges, slammed into the android's forehead.\nClark 72047 swayed slightly and then collapsed.\nThe attendant ran forward, kneeling beside him.\nYou, you're injured,\" the attendant said.\n\"Yes,\" Clark 72047 said.\nA dark green fluid was running from his forehead and into his eyes.\nThe attendant grabbed a bandanna from his pocket and dabbed at the android's head. He tried to slow the loss of fluid but could not.\n\"You're bleeding badly,\" he said.\nHe suddenly realized what he had said.\n\"I mean, well, you're leaking,\" he said.\nThe fluid continued to drain rapidly from the android's head.\nClark 72047 was rapidly going off-line and knew it. With an effort he turned his head to look directly into the attendant's eyes a second before his physical control program deactivated. His vision program shut down then and the light in his eyes died. His speech programs were almost completely shut down. The only voice he had left was his most sympathetic one.\n\"You were right the first time,\" Clark 72047 said. \"I am bleeding.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}

And, during these times, are when the worst nightmares seem to occur.\nAs she was away on such a trip tonight, I again experienced a nightmare, this time, set in the distant future and probably best described on a proverbial scale of 1 to 10, as a 12.\nAt the very least, this one was definitely off the Richter scale. The only good thing about tonight was that this was my wife's last night away during this particular outing, and I anxiously awaited her arrival in a few short hours.\nIn the nightmare, however, Cheryl had suddenly been killed, although I don't know how, nor why. In the opening scene, I was standing, watching the embalming process through tear-soaked eyes, which was nothing like it is today.\nFirstly, the funeral parlor was located in a strip mall, of all places. In fact, you could, literally, walk out from having shopped at a shoe store such as Pay Less next door, and directly into the funeral home.\nSecondly, the embalming area of the service was not located in the rear of the parlor as is tradition, but was, alternatively, up front, on full display and in open view, just as the other neighboring stores' products and services were.\nStrangely, no passersby seemed upset whatsoever with this setup, except for me as I remembered how the experience of death was once considered to be a very respectable deal. But today, it was akin to a stop-in at McDonald's, except you casually dropped your order off instead of picking it up.\nI watched other people simply walk by while seeing all the gore, a few shrugging their shoulders, but all generally still moving along, most of them apparently accepting of and not giving another thought to any of it, or worse, oblivious to it entirely.\nIn any event, I was immediately cast into this horrific scene, watching my wife being embalmed, which freaked me out enough due to the fact that she wasn't being embalmed via the traditional method whereby the body is lying vertically.\nShe was, instead, standing...held up and supported by some strange apparatus consisting of what appeared to be an approximately 3-inch round elongated PVC-like pipe running vertically from along the left side of her head, down to her left leg, with the angular end of it inserted into her calf.\nHer legs were spread a shoulder-width apart and her head sagged, with her chin resting against her chest. Her eyes were closed and her arms were outstretched and supported on what appeared to be a 5-feet crossbar that ran behind her neck, giving her the appearance of having just been crucified. In fact, the apparatus on which she clung appeared to have the overall relative shape of a crucifix.\nInterestingly, she was also still professionally dressed, sans stockings, in a purple skirt and wearing the patent leather black high heels I remembered having bought for this particular business meeting.\nI stared in horror as the blood churned and dripped, making awful sounds as the unforgiving embalming system forced it from her body and into what appeared to be a bucket that had been placed directly below her leg. Each drop seemed to be amplified as if a microphone was sending its reverberating sound through a public address system.\nThen, for some odd reason, I had the desire to approach her in order to get a closer look at the system. I accessed the podium on which she was propped and braved a peek at the top of the pipe-like element, which I discovered had an open end.\nLord...I can't even remember what I saw (or felt) next, but I moved away from her, and off the podium to the front left angle of it.\nIn my peripheral vision, I saw a female, whom I assumed was a mortician, dressed in a powder blue shower cap and matching waist-length clinical jacket, blue jeans and sneakers while on her knees spreading two different types of gooey messes on the floor with a mitten on each hand. I then turned to look at her straight on.\nOne of the messes she was spreading with one hand in a wide back-and-forth wipe ritual was a sparkling light green in color while the other mess she was spreading in a similar fashion with the other hand, was a hazy yellow which also appeared to emit a foggy-like mist from it that rose to the ceiling.\nInstantaneously, an express delivery service person wearing a dark brown uniform labeled, \"Jetstream Services,\" across the left side of the chest, burst into the parlor, flinging one of the double glass doors against the wall, then rushed to the mortician and handed her a small boxed package while saying nothing. However, I could not see the face because of a mask and cap.\nImmediately, the mortician stared up at the deliverer with fearful eyes and a gaping mouth, seemingly surprised. She, then, went ballistic, yelling at me to run out to her car and get her purse, which I did, although I can't explain how I knew which car was hers, but I did.\nAll this time, I had the feeling that the reason she had become upset, was because the rates of the express deliverer, who now seemed to pace nervously across the floor, would dramatically increase within a certain time frame upon arrival. At least, that's what I reasoned at the time.\nRushing back inside and handing her the purse, the mortician, still on her knees and upset, gave me what I considered a dirty look, then jerked the purse from me and quickly opened it. She extracted a money clip of bills and tossed it to the delivery person, who caught it then rushed out the door just as having rushed in.\nAs I was still standing approximately ten feet away from Cheryl's body, I had just turned to get another glimpse of her still being automatically embalmed by this strange insensitive contraption when she startled me by suddenly jerking her head up from her chest, opening her eyes and locking a fixed stare onto something directly across the room on the far wall.\nSimultaneously, she removed her arms from the crossbar and brought them down by her sides. She then flexed the muscle in her calf once, which caused the contraption to react by automatically removing itself while emitting a buzzing sound.\nIn the next few seconds, she elevated her left leg in a quick jerky movement, holding it in a frozen state while the blood still dripped from it intermittently. During this, her eyes never altered their fixed state.\nA male mortician, who was wearing the same type of attire as the female mortician, entered from a back room, looked at my wife momentarily, then stared at me while stating that some unwelcome visitor had been in the funeral parlor \"messing with the body.\"\nHe then led me to a side area to watch a surveillance monitor, as I continued to stare back at my wife sporadically in utter amazement. The monitor revealed the top of my head, but not my face.\nWatching it, I assumed the remote camera was located somewhere in the pipe-like object I had just peered down though I never saw it.\nSuddenly, all hell broke loose. Cheryl's body made a strange guttural sound, and she released her fixated stare from whatever her eyes had espied, then turned her eyes on me. With a hint of a faint smile, she stepped away from the apparatus and down from the podium to the floor, as her body appeared to gather its composure.\nThen, more bodies, in all stages of decomposition, immediately appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and began dancing around fluidly and happily in what appeared to be a celebration of being 'alive' once more.\nSeeing all of this, unnaturally, I'm now well past the brink of any possible return to sanity and finally make my getaway in half a heartbeat, bolting out the parlor's front doors like a madman for my car, which I had, obviously, used my last good sense to leave parked alongside the curb.\nRushing to it and jumping in, while gathering the keys from my right pants pocket, that old black and white movie, \"Night of the Living Dead,\" began playing over and over in my mind.\nThe last scene I remember as I quickly slammed my door shut, started my car and threw it in gear, was looking through the parlor's window to see the male mortician laughing uncontrollably at me while now sitting in a rocking chair, holding and caressing a once dead baby who, just like all the others, seemed to have, somehow, miraculously come back to life. I barely smelled the smoke and heard the screeching from my car's spinning tires.\nI was awaken from this nightmare by knocking at my front door. I abruptly sat up, wiped the sweat from my brow, shook my head several times in an attempt to rid it of the cobwebs and gathered my robe from the foot of the bed, putting it on as I headed for the door.\nReaching it and peering through the peephole, I could see two uniformed policemen. A cold fear enveloped me as I, reluctantly, opened the door.\n\"Um, what's the problem, officers?\"\n\"Are you Mr. Simon...Mr. Peter Simon?\" one of them asked.\n\"Yes, I'm Peter Simon...what's going on?\"\n\"I'm afraid we have some unsettling news, Sir... it's...\" He hesitated, looked at his partner, then back at me. \"It's about your wife, Sir,\" he continued.\nA chill ran down the length of my spine and I felt my palms become moist.\n\"My...my wife?\" I muttered. \"Wha-what happened?\" I managed to get out.\n\"Sir, I'm afraid there's been an accident,\" the other officer informed me.\n\"An accident? What kind of an accident?\" I inquired, uncertain if it was an inbound plane accident, or if Cheryl had an accident on the way home, as she had driven her car to the airport, then left it reserved there.\n\"Sir, your wife's plane crashed while en route from Saint Louis. I'm sorry to say that, unfortunately, there were no survivors.\"\nThough I had suspected something was awry after seeing them, hearing this hit me like a ton of bricks, causing me to stagger backward a step, or two. I drew my hand to my face as I began to openly weep.\n\"Sir,\" the other officer began. \"Sir, we are, indeed, sorry for your loss. If you will please come down to the coroner's office for identification,\" he said, \"we will be glad to take you and bring you back.\"\n\"Yes...sure,\" I responded. \"Please come in while I get dressed.\"\nI quickly dressed as they waited, then chauffeured me to the coroner's office located on the east side of town. After a 30-minute drive, we turned into an all too familiar territory...a strip mall, pulling alongside a curb.\nThe driver shut off the car and both of the officers began to gather their accessories and exit the vehicle as I still sat, reluctant to move. Afraid of what was unfolding already, nervously, I turned and peered out the car window and through the coroner's window to see in plain view, my wife in a vertical position, supported by the same type of apparatus I had seen in my nightmare.\nI could also see the same male and female morticians as well, dressed exactly as they had been, awaiting my exit from the police cruiser with sly smiles on their faces. They stared at me, and I, at them.\n\"God,\" I prayed as the officer opened and held the door for me while I exited the cruiser. \"Please let this be just another friggin' nightmare.\"","source-hostname":"Ibn Qirtaiba"}
