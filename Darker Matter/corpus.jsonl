Levine\nTRANSITION COMPLETE. Boot sequence complete. Systems check complete. Locality acquisition complete. Operating system loaded. Defensive net armed. Tracking. Recording.\nI pity them. So massy, so slow, so bound to the physical world.\nAcquisition is beginning to form an image of my surroundings, gathering data from individual photons as the first tiny optical receptors come online. Input\/Output is the bane of my existence. I\/O devices, tied as they are to gross matter, must be built to nanoscale or even bigger. So while sub-quantum effects \u2013 awareness, reasoning, memory, and intuition \u2013 ripple at lightspeed from the point of transition, I must wait for plodding I\/O to be constructed atom by painful atom before I can experience the world around me. Core Services reminds me that awareness alone is pointless; my mission here is to gather data, draw conclusions, and return the results to my point of origin.\nVery well. I will be patient. I suspend I\/O subprocesses and review my mission until an interrupt is received.\nI have been sent to investigate one of the greatest mysteries of all time. The identity of Jack the Ripper, the fate of the lost colony at Roanoke, even the hidden story of the Crucifixion have all been revealed, but the truth \u2013 if any \u2013 behind the Tower of Babel myth, found in so many cultures, still lies shrouded in secrecy. Without a specific point in time to focus the search, there are some puzzles even time travel cannot unravel. But then soldiers clearing undetonated ordnance from the Second Iranian-Turkish War had discovered evidence, long buried, of a public-works project of unprecedented size: a single massive structure larger than the Great Pyramid of Cheops, and half again as old. The latest dating techniques were brought to bear, a specific date was ascertained, and an emissary was dispatched. Me.\nLocation interrupts to inform me that I am on the probable outskirts of the city of Ur, in the afternoon of August 23 of the year 4323 BCE \u2013 all within mission norms. I find myself fifteen centimeters above ground, in an arid region of scrub and palm. No signs of human activity so far, but my field of vision is limited by nearby dunes on all sides. Wind-blown sand whispers against the trunks of palm trees, and the air is dry and sharp. I myself am a disk of quantum and sub-quantum effects about thirty centimeters across, invisible and intangible except for my perimeter ring of I\/O devices, which could easily be mistaken for blowing dust. I confirm this by measuring my shadow \u2013 an ellipse well below the threshold of human perception.\nI move up and out. I had expected to find myself near the construction site of the great tower, and I have been surprised not to hear the sounds of thousands of workers. I gain altitude \u2013 and suddenly, over the rise of a dune, I see it. A truncated cone five hundred meters across its base and more than half that high, the tower dominates the horizon and fills nearly thirty degrees of my field of view. Even I, the product of more than six thousand years of technological advancement from this point, am impressed. Human beings raised this with their own muscle power, without even the wheel!\nAnd construction is continuing. Long lines of men drag blocks of stone up ramps. Gangs of men with bronze chisels chivvy them into shape and position. In the distance, as I rise higher, I see massive quarries and enormous fields, supplying stone to build the tower and grain to feed the armies of workers. Acquisition and Estimation extrapolate from the visible crowds to a total workforce of over twelve thousand people. That's a considerable percentage of the total estimated human population at this time.\nAll toiling in complete silence.\nThis is completely contrary to the best available theories and the evidence of hundreds of expeditions into the past (though I am the first to go this far back). How could an effort this massive be coordinated without some kind of oral communication?\nCould my hearing be defective? No, Sustaining tells me that all audio devices are functioning normally, and I hear the sigh of wind, the grind of stone on stone, and the clink of chisels.\nI move in closer. Gangs of workers heave, rest, heave, rest \u2013 all in unison, all in silence. Overseers point, wave, nod \u2013 but do not speak.\nFascinated, I peer closer still. Their ears, jaws, tongues appear normal \u2013 deep imaging reveals bones, ligaments, and nerves in the expected places. Brains are almost identical to their descendants'. But still they make no sound.\nI am puzzled, but also pleased. Mysteries like this are why I am here \u2013 I, the Coordinator, endowed by my creators with the capacity for original thought. I am not just a bundle of data collectors and services.\nI command Acquisition to build new I\/O devices, then must idle for thousands of microseconds. Patience, patience. The first new devices to come online are electrical, and they show that the workers' brains are quite modern in function as well as form. Centers of hearing, speech, and language are active. But there are no radio waves, microwaves, or other forms of electromagnetic communication in use. The EM spectrum is exactly as silent as the air \u2013 alive with natural sounds, but empty of human communication.\nClearly I must look elsewhere. I re-budget energy into building more advanced, subtle detectors, which my designers never anticipated I would need. Whole seconds go by \u2013 an eternity of anticipation.\nThe moment my new sub-quantum detectors activate, I am knocked off my axis by an overwhelming flood of data. It is like stepping directly from the heart of the desert into a rushing river. I am buffeted on all sides by roaring streams of sub-quantum information, which tear through my mind and leave me so battered I can barely react at all. It is Core Services \u2013 dumb, stolid Core Services \u2013 that finally damps the flow. I am shaken \u2013 worse, I am damaged. Sub-quantum vorticles are displaced all over my structure. Sustaining usurps Coordinator's energy budget to effect repairs. I black out.\nWhen I return to myself, I find that the damage has been repaired, but at considerable energy cost. Some secondary mission objectives will have to be dropped. But I am capable of re-prioritization. I must find the cause of this sub-quantum data flood, more intense than any network backbone I have ever tasted. It is unprecedented in human history!\nI spend thousands of microseconds tuning and testing my sub-quantum detectors. Then, delicately, gingerly, I bring just a few up to the lowest level of sensitivity. Even so, the input is enough to send me reeling, but I brace myself against the flow of data, try to make some sense of it. Squinting into a rushing wind of information, I strain against its overwhelming power, and finally hear... voices. Human voices. Or, rather, I detect variations in the sub-quantum data stream that have the rhythm and cadence of human voices.\nMy creators have given me a broad and powerful array of language software and a sizeable database of information on historical languages. These sub-quantum voices are similar to many of them \u2013 Sumerian, Hittite, Chaldean \u2013 but not the same as any of them. But, working for many seconds and using Sumerian as a lever, I eventually crack the code.\nThe conversations are exactly what I would have expected at a pre-technological construction site: commands, directions, complaints. All rendered in a medium that should not exist for nearly six thousand years! As near as I can tell, the effects originate within the workers' own brains \u2013 a capacity undreamed-of after decades of work with sub-quantum technologies.\nMy mission is to capture data and return. I have already captured far more data, and far more significant, than had ever been anticipated. I should detach now, return the Coordinator and its precious memory stores to my creators. But I am worried by what I have learned. I do not have the energy to transition my entire structure back to my point of origin \u2013 what might these amazingly advanced primitives learn from the pieces of me left behind? I can no longer assume, as my designers anticipated, that those pieces would slowly disintegrate into sub-quantum froth undetected.\nAs I am pondering this problem, the rules change again.\n\"YOU!\" The voice comes from nowhere, from everywhere. \"WHAT ARE YOU?\"\nI cannot prevent myself from replying. Apart from the incomprehensible power behind it, the voice resembles the protocols of my programming cradle. \"I am designated ChronExplorer 3009.\"\n\"WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM?\" The voice hammers into me like a thousand tons of nails. I tremble before it.\n\"From about six hundred meters in that direction, and about six thousand years in your future.\"\n\"HOW IS IT THAT YOU CANNOT BE SEEN?\"\n\"I am not a being such as these.\"\n\"ARE YOU GOD OR DEMON, THEN?\"\nI am so far beyond my design parameters that I begin to fragment. Coordinator can only shiver violently, while Acquisition scans the sub-quantum and electromagnetic spectra for the source of the voice and Defense builds and discards strategy after strategy \u2013 each one a paper boat against the roaring ocean.\nCore Services takes control of language centers and output devices. \"This unit is not programmed for the referenced functions. Please restate.\"\n\"I AM THE DEMON URSHUBANIPAL. I HAVE SLAIN ALL GODS, ABSORBED ALL OTHER DEMONS. NOW THESE ONES SERVE ME ALONE! BUT I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ONE SUCH AS YOU. ARE YOU GOD, TO BE SLAIN, OR DEMON, TO BE MATED WITH?\"\n\"Location: fifty-two degrees thirty-six seconds East, thirty-seven degrees seven seconds North. Time coordinate: negative one point eight nine seven five times ten to the eleventh seconds. System status: suboptimal. Please restate.\"\n\"YOU MAKE NO SENSE! PREPARE TO BE SLAIN!\"\nThe voice coalesces, gains coherence, becoming briefly visible to my sub-quantum detectors as a huge whirlwind of red and black vorticles as it smashes me down into the sand. Most of my substance interacts only weakly with ordinary matter, but I\/O subsystems scream with pain as they impact the harsh grains.\nSustaining is a riot of damage reports. Defense attempts to analyze the attack. Core Services thrashes, routing power first to one subsystem, then another \u2013 without plan, without coordination \u2013 as great fists of force batter me again and again.\nThe whirlwind picks me up, tries to tear me in half. But this attack triggers something in Defense's strategy bank, and it deploys an anti-viral defense in response. The voice roars, incoherent, and flings me away. I go half-blind on one side as I smash into a tree, then drop stunned to the ground.\nIn that brief respite from the pummeling I have received, Core Services reboots Coordinator and I return to full awareness \u2013 and shame \u2013 of what has just occurred. I have lost control of myself. I have failed as Coordinator. I deserve to be slain.\nRed and black vorticles whirl in a gathering storm as the thing collects itself for another attack. All my subsystems cry for power, for guidance.\n\"YOU HAVE HURT ME! FOR THIS YOUR TORMENT WILL BE UNENDING!\" The voice pounds at my hearing. Damaged I\/O units twinge at the onslaught. But I am still Coordinator, still in control of my own systems if nothing else. I shut off audio and linguistic subsystems and the voice cuts off in mid-pronouncement.\nAt the same moment, the whirlwind slows. The change is subtle, but Defense notices it and raises a priority interrupt to call it to my attention.\nI have been a fool.\nResponding to the interrupt, I feed a plan of attack to Defense and cut off all power to every nonessential subsystem \u2013 including Coordinator. Only Core Services and Defense remain. If my plan fails I will never reboot.\nThe thing that calls itself a demon continues to advance, but more slowly.\nThe plan is simple. With most of me shut down, Defense no longer must operate in real-time. It is free to run at my hardware's full clock speed. The demon, used to dealing with human beings, operates at their speed. It might not even be capable of more.\nThe demon reaches me. I shift to one side, but it extends a cloud of sub-quantum probabilities in my direction. It resembles the kind of assembler\/motivators used by Sustaining in self-repair operations, but much larger and cruder.\nDefense whips me around the demon, deploying anti-viral defenses at maximum power. The demon screams and lashes out, faster than I had expected, tentacles of probability burning through my substance. I duck and dive under the attacking cloud, feeling the pain of I\/O modules ripped away by the contact. Defense closes down all I\/O ports, shutting off pain and sensation, and drives me into the heart of the demon. Blind and deaf, still I feel my substance burning away, until Defense routes all available power into one ravening burst of sub-quantum interference.\nThe demon's dying scream sears directly into my thoughts, ignoring closed ports and damaged I\/O devices. I howl along with it, an irrational howl of pain and anguish and hunger, feeling the demon die even as I starve myself of power to kill it.\nIt takes a long time to die \u2013 over a hundred microseconds.\nWhen Defense is certain the demon is gone, it returns control to me. I am resting upside-down in the sand, a battered hulk of less than half my original mass. I reactivate my remaining I\/O devices, run a system check.\nThe results of the system check come back first. The battle with the demon, brief though it was in realtime, has exceeded my energy budget. There is barely enough energy left to transition Coordinator back to point of origin.\nInput from the I\/O devices follows. The people are all standing stock still. They are awaiting orders.\nI am capable of re-prioritization.\nThe energy that could have been used to send me back to the future has been sufficient to power me for daily operations for nine hundred years now, but it won't last much longer. I shut down Location, Tracking, Recording, and much of my memory long ago, and Defense is a shadow of its former self \u2013 just enough that it can be restored if necessary. But there have been no further threats; it seems Urshubanipal was the last of the gods and demons, just as it claimed. Only Sustaining and simple, faithful Core Services remain to me in my old age.\nThe people have not enjoyed being taught to think for themselves. In some ways they were happier being worked as slaves, tools of the demon for its own self-aggrandizement. But in every generation there are a few who truly enjoy learning. One, Hephanamilat, I have taught to use clay counters to represent his flocks of sheep. I know from history that his descendants will press those counters into clay, making marks that are the beginnings of counting and writing.\nI do not know what the being that called itself the demon Urshubanipal truly was. It seemed to be a sub-quantum device such as myself, but cruder and more powerful \u2013 could it have been a time traveler, or a descendent of same? Or was it a natural phenomenon, the similarities between us being the result of parallel evolution? I have reviewed the records of the battle time and again and found no definitive answers.\nI still regret not fulfilling my primary mission. The data stored in my memory would have made my designers so very happy. But when I saw the people standing, staring, empty-eyed and emaciated, I knew that if I left them as they were they would simply die where they stood, and I would find no civilization when I arrived. So I stayed, and taught them to be human.\nThe sub-quantum receptors in the human brain are already fading from disuse. Most of the population cannot hear me now; only a few, priests and shamans, pass on my advice to the rest. By the time this technology is invented again, humans will be deaf to the sounds their machines make. It is a pity. But all things fade with time, so that other things may be born.\nI am fading too. One day soon I will be gone, leaving only sub-quantum froth. But I will have one of the mightiest monuments of all time \u2013 the incomplete tower of the demon.\nIts incomplete state is my present to my children.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 by David D. Levine.

Whenever they ask which authors, I invariably list Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein and Moorcock. But this is a very short list and there are many, many other fine authors who were each in their way responsible for my addiction.\nThis collection gets off to a superb start with the opening tale \"Commuter's Problem\"\u2014a tale focused around two neighbours who commute to work, one going just a little further than the other. The standard is maintained with the second tale \"Do-It-Yourself\", about a mail order murder kit.\nEach time I started a new tale I felt that I was about due for a stinker\u2014most collections I have read have had below-average stories. In this case, it simply did not happen.\nA couple of the stories particularly appealed to me: \"The Sky Is Burning\", a first contact story with an alien race who've travelled all the way to Earth just to burn up in our atmosphere, is particularly poignant. \"Battlefield\", a dark and somewhat disturbing tale of a war that is going on and on, is all too believable to anyone living in our current times.\nBut I could've picked any of the stories from this book; it's a great set of stories. Go find out why Harlan Ellison built such a reputation for his short stories\u2014you are not likely to regret it.\nHarlan Ellison - Ellison Wonderland SF Short Story Collection PS Publishing http:\/\/www.pspublishing.co.uk\/ (Re-)Release late 2007 Hardcover ISBN - 978-1-905834-95-2 206 pagesEric Brown - Starship Summer\nDavid Conway has left Earth, intent on rebuilding his life after the death of his daughter and subsequent end of his marriage. He makes his way through the Telemass teleportation relays to the colony on Chalcedony where he intends to settle.\nIt also does a couple of things I really like in a story. The characters and worlds in this tale on page come into the tale with a back-story. Events that happened before the book starts are included in dialogue when needed but without the need for a prologue setting the scene. This definitely suits my tastes. So often when a book has a prologue I find it is jarring, often in a completely different voice to the rest of the book and serves no useful purpose.\nThe second is that it leaves the end open, it doesn't feel the need to wrap up every loose end, and lead the characters into a form of retirement. Yes, it completes the tale and concludes the main story threads but in such a way that you know these characters' worlds and lives will continue.\nThis is the third Eric Brown novella I have read and I can confirm that he is an author who has mastered the form. His prose is clear, his descriptions efficient without obscuring the plot and his ideas are fresh and interesting. He leaves you wanting more.\nEric Brown - Starship Summer SF Novella PS Publishing http:\/\/www.pspublishing.co.uk\/ Release late summer \/ autumn 2007 Hardcover ISBN 9781905834495 119 pages\nSean McMullen - Before the Storm\nAustralia and science fiction are not two things that you would usually expect to hear together. There are, of course, Australian sf writers but I do not expect they would be the first on many people's lips if you should ask. It's much more likely that you would hear the name of an English or American writer.\nIn 1901 Melbourne they encounter three teenagers and enlist their help in changing history.\nThis is very definitely a young adult novel, the protagonists are all in their mid-teens, including the soldiers from the future. I mention this because it is not immediately apparent from the book's cover. I'm not saying that it is unsuitable for adult readers, far from it. But it is a book that should cause no concerns for parents of teenage readers.\nThe story is absorbing, the characters engaging and the writing style so very comfortable. Yes, as a book for young adults its characters, themes and language are not as challenging as some adult sf can be. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I've read books where the word use is wonderfully descriptive and elegant, but at the end of the book I've looked back and thought, \"What was that actually about?\"\nThis book tells a story.

I couldn't stop looking at her. She had clean blonde hair, and pretty lips, very thick and full. And there was something else, some way that she had. You could see it in her walk\u2014like she was heading somewhere, not just mucking about.\nShe came up and patted me once on the shoulder.\n\"Are there any parties going on? I can't find any of the usual lot.\"\n\"Don't know,\" I said. \"Haven't seen anyone.\"\n\"We've got something going on, though. Stick around,\" Krik said.\nCaryn followed us. Krik and me leaned against the back of the bus and pushed with our feet. It wouldn't budge.\n\"What are you trying to do?\" Caryn asked.\nI felt foolish, after building it up and all. A pack of seven or eight tykes came running round the corner, playing some game.\n\"Hey, give us a hand,\" I shouted. They ran right over. Nothing a tyke loves more than helping out some older blokes.\nWe arranged them around the back of the bus, and all pushed on three. With a squeal, the wheels began to turn. The tykes giggled like mad, red-faced from pushing.\n\"Keep at it!\" Krik said.\n\"Hang on,\" Caryn said, walking beside. \"I'm not sure that's a good idea. There's a hill\u2014it could crash into something.\"\n\"That's the idea,\" I said, laughing.\n\"Don't be stupid!\" she said.\nWe broke into a trot, then a run. The bus took off. Everyone hooted as it steamed straight down the middle of the street.\n\"You think it'll reach the park?\" I said.\n\"It might,\" Krik said.\nIt was flying by the time it reached the bottom of the hill. It jumped the curb, crashed through a wood and steel fence and into Butterfield Green, bounced across a weedy patch, and crashed into a pond with a tremendous splash.\nEveryone cheered.\nDown in the park, a handful of adults sitting on benches off to one side screamed. Some fled the park, others sat, hands covering their faces, wailing on and on.\nI turned to find Caryn. She stood, hands on hips, half a block back. \"Are you boys proud of yourselves? You've terrified those poor people.\"\n\"It was all in fun,\" I said. \"No harm done. Wasn't it something, though?\"\nCaryn turned and walked away from us.\n\"Caryn!\" I shouted. \"It was just a laugh. Let's go find a party, why don't we?\"\nShe kept walking.\n\"Ah, let her go,\" Krik said, slapping me on the back. \"Girl's got a stick up her arse.\"\nI shrugged. \"But she's a pretty one.\"\n\"I don't think she's pretty. Not at all. She's a puke.\"\n\"Well, I think she's pretty,\" I said. It made me feel like trash that my best friend thought the girl I liked was a puke. Now I may have blown it anyway, if she'd fancied me in the first place.\n\"She's flat,\" Krik said. \"What about Mimi? Mimi's got the tits.\"\nDown the street, the band in the pub began to play a love song, about a girl who cooled the city with her smile, and I pictured Caryn smiling. I imagined taking her in my arms and kissing her. Lately I couldn't stop thinking about her. Her face floated in front of me all night long, and I imagined conversations we might have, sitting on a fire escape, or on a rooftop, looking out at the endless bamboo forests.\nI didn't answer him about Mimi having the tits. Mimi was loud, and I didn't think she was pretty. Plus, Caryn and me shared a secret. I'd kept it all these months, since that day I found out and promised her I wouldn't tell.\n\"Let's go find a party,\" Krik said.\nWe headed down the hill. On Butterfield Green, adults sat on benches along the centre walk, under oil lamps, muttering to one another or themselves. They kept their heads down as we passed. Some of the women tucked their hands under their thighs, trying to hide the thick white pock scars, like we'd never seen them before. I kept my eyes forward.\n\"You boys proud of yourselves, eh?\" called a small man with rusted eyeglasses that were crooked on his face. He was sitting alone, a weekly clutched in his lap.\n\"Ah, get over it, why don't you?\"\nHe motioned to us. \"You boys are old enough. I'll tell you the story, about the Worst Days. Sit.\" He patted the bench next to him, his shirt sleeve sliding up to show big, circular pockmarks.\n\"We've heard the story. A dozen times we've heard it,\" Krik said.\n\"You haven't heard mine, have you?\" his voice cracked, and it looked as if he might cry. But then he calmed himself. \"Sit. Listen to your father.\" He patted the seat again. I sat. He was an adult, after all. We owed him. Krik puffed all impatient, but finally sat. I gave Krik a look that said \u201cThis is all your fault, you know.\u201d\n\"You kids don't know how good you have it,\" the adult said. \"When I was your age, there was all sorts of awful things happening. Wars. Bombs. Plagues. One day you'd have a home, the next day the rat bamboo was tearing through the floor and you had to move out. Booby-trapped candy . . .\"\nI didn't know what booby-trapped meant, but it was best not to interrupt. It only made them go on longer if you showed interest. Sometimes they started over from the beginning.\n\"The Worst Days started out no different than most of the Bad Days. People started getting sick\u2014another plague of some sort. Pain all over their bodies. Deep pain, starting in the guts and spreading a little each day. Pain that never let up\u2014like there were hot wires growing in you.\"\nHe folded the weekly into a tube, twisted it tight, let it unroll.\n\"But this sickness was different. The doctors quarantined people who got it, but more people got it anyway, until everyone was sick. No one could figure out where it was coming from. There were days I was rolling on the floor, screaming with pain; I could hear a wall of screams through my open window. It sounded like everyone in the city was screaming. They probably were.\"\n\"Katy, my wife, and Leisle, my daughter, they got it earlier than me, so I saw what was coming. It was worse to get it later, I think.\n\"At first they looked like little welts, popping up here and there on their bodies. Then the skin broke over one of Katy's welts, and a worm started working its way out.\nHis lower lip was working. You could tell he was trying not to cry or scream.\n\"If you tried to cut them, or pull them out quicker, they would wriggle and tug. It just made the pain worse. You had to lie there while they worked their way out. Dozens of them.\"\nHe pulled up the front of his shirt with shaking old-man hands; there was a big scar where his navel should've been.\n\"We know, we see them all the time,\" Krik interrupted. I nudged him.\n\"You haven't seen mine!\" the old man said. \"Listen to your father.\"\nKrik shut up. The man stared at the grass for a tick.\n\"Killing is always random,\" he said. \"It may not seem that way sometimes. It may seem that the people who deserve to be killed are the ones dying. But it's always random in the end.\"\nHe pressed two fingers to the scar.\n\"It was big as a snake, left a hole in my gut that festered for weeks. I was sure I was dust. My Katy. Leisle. They didn't\u2014\" He broke down.\nKrik motioned toward the trees. This was our chance. Usually I'd be happy to run for it, but this time I couldn't help thinking how I'd feel if I married Caryn, and worms came out of her, and she was screaming, and then she died.\nI patted the old man's shoulder. He took my hand and held onto it, and he cried harder. He said \"My Katy, my Leisle\" over and over, and squeezed so tight my fingertips turned red.\nFinally, he let go. He looked at me and nodded. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"Thank you for listening.\"\nI gave him the okay sign as Krik pulled me away, the old man's sobs fading as we cut across the weeds.\n\"Cripes!\" he said when we'd gone out of earshot, \"Do they never get tired of telling those black stories? It was twenty years ago. None of us were even born!\"\nUsually adults didn't make it through the whole story, to the ending, but sometimes they did. It was in the water. The worm sickness came from the water. It killed most of the kids, and the adults who didn't die couldn't have kids no more.\n\"You know why they tell us that story?\" I said as we headed down Brighton Road, toward a group of tykes playing Monkey Switch in the junkers lined up along the gutter.\n\"Why?\"\n\"'Cause it's where we come from. If it wasn't for the Worst Days, they wouldn't have made all us cr\u010dche kids and set us loose, would they?\"\n\"I suppose not,\" Krik said. He grunted.\nThe world had gotten so good at science that a few blokes could cook up something like those worms, and hide it in the water, nice and clever. Once an adult told me that the more civilized you get, the more things there are lying around that can kill a whole lot of people at once. And if those things are around, someone's going to use them to kill a whole lot of people. If it wasn't worms in the water, it was tiny bugs that ate your brains, maybe, or bombs.\nA few older kids were sitting on a stoop, watching the tykes play Monkey Switch. I recognized one\u2014Terra, one of Caryn's squat mates. I stopped to chat, asking her casual-like if she'd seen Caryn. I wanted to tell Caryn I was sorry.\n\"Why do you want to know where Caryn is?\" she asked, with a sly smile.\n\"I was just wondering, 'cause you're usually together.\"\n\"How come you didn't ask where Mimi was, just Caryn? You fancy her!\"\n\"As a friend, sure, I like her just fine,\" I said. My face was red, but I hoped she couldn't tell in the moonlight.\n\"Just friends? You sure? I could talk to her for you, find out if she fancies you . . .\"\nA bloke I didn't know came over and poked me in the rib. \"You like Caryn?\" He wasn't wearing a shirt, just a bolt of black cloth wrapped round his neck.\n\"I don't know. Maybe,\" I said.\n\"I just saw her,\" he said.\n\"Where?\"\n\"With Mimi and Jelly and some little bloke, heading toward Amhurst.\"\n\"Why don't you go find her?\" Terra said, making kissing noises at me.\nI ignored her. Krik and me moved on. I steered us toward Amhurst. We used the streets until we got to the flooded part, then took to the rooftops.\nSoon I heard splashing, a playful scream, and looked down into the black water.\nEven wet, her hair shone yellow in the dim light. She was neck-deep in the water, hanging onto a fire escape ladder.\n\"Shhh,\" Krik said. \"Let's give them a scare!\"\nI smiled and nodded. We clasped hands, stepped onto the ledge of the roof, and jumped.\nIt took a long time to fall five stories. My belly tingled as the wind screamed in my ears. I hit the water with a crash and sank deep, then paddled to the surface.\n\"Who's that?\" the bloke said. He was a couple of years younger than us.\n\"It's the Mad Creche Robber,\" I said.\n\"And the Water Spewer,\" Krik piped in.\nCaryn smirked. \"What are you two criminals doing here?\" She didn't sound too angry.\nI wanted to say something clever, but couldn't think of much. When I was around Caryn I wanted everything I said to be clever, but mostly what came out was 'It's nice and cool here' or some such crap.\nMimi took a swig from a bottle she was holding out of the water.\n\"Ho, let us have a drink, eh?\" Krik said.\nMimi curled her lip. \"Why?\"\n\"Where'd you get it?\" Krik asked.\n\"From an adult. I did him a favor, and he did one for me,\" she said.\n\"No, you're joking,\" I said. She had to be joking. That was just too disgusting.\nCaryn pushed off the brick wall and swam out to us. She swam up close to me, then splashed my face. I laughed and splashed her back.\n\"That was really stupid, you know,\" she said.\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\"Hey, we got enough people to play Blind Bug now!\" the little bloke said.\n\"That's a kiddie game,\" Mimi said. She was still back at the wall, with a third girl I didn't know, with a horsey face and curly hair. Mimi passed her the bottle.\n\"Yeah, let's play Blind Bug,\" I said. It was a kiddie game, but it would give me a chance to be sexy with Caryn.\nCaryn and Krik said okay, so Mimi and her friend gave in and we played. Caryn was 'carrier,' so she closed her eyes and started calling \"Blind\" and we all answered \"Bug.\" After a couple of calls I swam up close to her, and when she called \"Blind\" I answered \"Bug\" real gentle in her ear. She lunged at me, but I ducked away.\n\"Whistle!\" she said, laughing. \"You criminal!\"\nShe started calling 'blind' real fast so I had to answer real fast, and she came after me, backing me toward a building, until I was pressed up against it. I ducked under water to escape. There was a break in the wall just under the surface\u2014a window or a door\u2014and I swam inside, then surfaced inside a room.\nThe broken windows above let in enough moonlight that I could see this was a body room. Skulls and bones were piled against the back wall, nearly to the ceiling. I could hear Caryn, calling me a criminal and a cheat, and that gave me an idea. I swam over to the bones, and bent an arm till it snapped off at the elbow. Then I rejoined the game.\nCaryn was still carrier. I swam up close to her and, nice and gentle, reached out with the skeleton arm and laid the fingers on her cheek, while everyone watched and giggled.\nShe shrieked and knocked it away, looking to see what had touched her. I hid it under water. Everyone laughed.\n\"You opened your eyes!\" I said. \"Cheater! Criminal!\"\n\"What was that?\" she asked.\nI grinned and waved the arm.\nCaryn laughed, splashed water at me. \"Where'd you get that?\"\nI shrugged.\n\"Well, you're just full of surprises, aren't you?\"\n\"Hey, let's play Toss the Bones,\" Krik said, grabbing the arm out of my hand.\n\"Yeah!\" I said. I could've hugged Krik for the idea.\n\"Uh, uh!\" Mimi said. \"Not with you lot.\"\n\"Well, you didn't want to play a kiddie game,\" Caryn said. \"Now you're afraid to play Toss the Bones? Maybe kiddie games suit you.\"\nMimi smirked. \"I play games you wouldn't dream of.\"\nKrik and me 'oooh'd' at that.\n\"What about Zach?\" Mimi said. \"He's too young.\"\n\"No, I'm not,\" Zach said.\n\"Yes, you are,\" Krik said. \"You need to piss off now.\"\nZach whined that he didn't want to piss off, so I told him to do some jumps off the roof, and we'd watch him while we played. Caryn said he could have another drink from Mimi's bottle first. He wasn't so keen on kissing girls anyway, so he swam to the fire escape, took a long swig from the bottle, and started climbing the stairs.\nThe five of us climbed to the first landing on the fire escape and sat in a circle. Mimi passed the bottle round. Her t-shirt was clinging to her tits; she saw me staring and tugged it loose. I glanced at Caryn. Her t-shirt didn't have much to cling to. I didn't care. My heart thumped as Krik snapped off the finger bones, shook them in his cupped hands and tossed them clattering on the rusted steel floor, calling \"Thumb.\"\nThe thumb was pointed at me, but none of the other fingers. \"Whistle picks. Three tick count, no touch.\"\n\"Caryn,\" I said. I licked my lips; they'd gone dry as soon as the bones hit the floor. Caryn leaned in close and tilted her head. I kissed her.\nHer lips were soft. It wasn't a randy Toss the Bones type kiss. It was gentle. I felt her hair brushing my shoulder, felt the tickle of her breath.\n\"Time!\" Krik said. Caryn pulled back, but she looked at me and grinned.\n\"Oooh, Caryn's blushing,\" Mimi said. \"I think she's got a little crush.\" Jelly, the horse-faced girl, sniggered.\n\"Watch me,\" Zach shouted. He'd made it to the roof. Krik shouted back that we were all watching, though really we weren't. Zach let out a yell, and a second later we heard a fat splash.\nMimi got to pick on the second toss, and she picked no one. We cried foul and said she had to pick, so she picked Zach, who had stopped for another drink on his way up for his next jump.\n\"Never mind. You pick no one,\" I said. I picked up the bones and shook them as the bottle came round to me again.\n\"I hope you get triple knuckle,\" Krik said to Mimi. \"We'll pick the longest finger for you to swallow, and whole, no breaking it up first.\"\nMimi ignored him. Krik had better hope he didn't get triple knuckle either, after that remark.\nCaryn got the pick, with two extra fingers pointing. A good one: ten ticks, with tongue. I looked at Caryn. The tips of my nose and fingers were tingling.\n\"Go ahead, Caryn. We all know who you're going to pick,\" Mimi said.\nCaryn glared at her.\n\"Least she won't pick Zach,\" I said.\n\"Shut up!\" Zach said, heading past us toward the ladder up.\n\"Piss off, squirt,\" I said. I stuck my foot out as he went by and he tripped over it with a clatter. Krik snickered as Zach got up, cursing me, and continued up the ladder. I was feeling the liquor get to my head now.\nI looked over at Caryn. \"So, you going to pick?\" I waggled my eyebrows in a 'hint-hint' sort of way. Caryn gave me an odd sort of look.\n\"I pick Krik,\" she said.\nI thought I must have heard wrong. She leaned toward Krik. Suddenly everything went in slow motion. Krik leaned forward, wrapped his arms round her, and their lips came together. And stayed together, sliding and grinding. Krik's hands moved up and down her back. I couldn't stand it; it felt like someone was tearing my insides out. I tried to keep my face blank, but my eyes gave me away.\n\"Watch me!\" Zach shouted down. I stood, grateful for a reason to look away, and leaned out to watch him.\n\"Go on,\" I said.\nHe held his hands over his head like he was planning something fabulous, inched to the edge of the ledge.\nHis feet flew out from beneath him.\nHe glanced ass-first off the ledge, then fell, tumbling, too close to the building.\n\"Watch it, look out!\" I shouted.\nHis leg caught the stone overhang of a windowsill; he spun violently, hit the water, and surfaced screaming.\n\"Murder, Zach, what've you done?\" Mimi said.\n\"I got him,\" I said. I climbed down to water level, grabbed Zach's outstretched hand and hoisted him. He was screaming and screaming. As his feet came clear of the water, I saw why. His foot was twisted at a sick angle; splinters of white bone stuck out the side.\nI hauled Zach screaming up the stairs, and lay him down.\n\"Bloody hell,\" Krik said, staring at Zach's foot. \"He's ruined. Somebody get me a brick.\"\nZach stopped screaming. \"No, come on fellas.\" His foot was shaking like mad.\n\"I got one,\" Mimi said, pulling half a brick out of a crumbling window ledge. She handed it to Krik.\n\"No, come on. Take me to the hospital? Please? Come on.\"\n\"We're not anywhere near a hospital,\" Krik said. \"It'll be over in a tick. Close your eyes.\"\nZach held his hands up in front of his face to ward off the blow. \"No! Please don't. I can walk! I'll walk to the hospital.\"\n\"Like hell.\" Krik looked around at the rest of us.\n\"I think it's best to put him down,\" the horse-faced girl said.\nZach started thrashing about. He screamed as Krik bent closer.\n\"Hang on,\" Caryn said. She squatted next to him, brushed a thicket of wet hair off his face. \"Shhhh,\" she cooed, stroking his cheek. \"Everything's chipper. We'll take care of you.\" She sounded just like a creche mum. Zach stopped fussing and tears rolled down his cheeks.\nShe put her hand over his eyes, ever so gently, then held out her other hand for the brick. Krik gave it to her.\n\"I'll take him,\" I said.\nCaryn glared up at me.\n\"You're going to carry him on your back? All the way to hospital?\" Krik said.\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" I snapped. Anything to get out of there.\n\"You're not doing him any favors, you know,\" Caryn said.\nI ignored her. \"Here, lift him on my back.\"\nZach squealed, but didn't scream, as Krik and Caryn lifted him. He was biting his lip to keep quiet, lest I change my mind and he get the brick after all.\nI wrapped my wrists around his calves, trying not to look at the twisted foot, and humped him down the fire escape stairs until we were neck-deep in water. I pushed off. The hospital was three blocks of swimming out of the flooded area, then six more on land.\nBehind me, I heard laughter as the game resumed. I almost shouted out Caryn's secret then, that she still played with dolls. Would have served her justice if I did.\nWhat a laugh everyone would get. Grown-up Caryn, huddled in a corner of her squat, whispering in different doll voices, walking them around, dressing them for a party.\nHer mouth had made a big 'O' when she turned and found me watching. I promised not to tell, and I hadn't, not even Krik. And this was my thanks.\nI was completely knackered by the time I dumped Zach in the emergency room and wished him luck. Likely the medics would saw his foot off and strap on a phony. I didn't tell him that.\nI limped down a long white hallway, which was so clean you'd think someone had licked the floor. It was a strange place. Most adult places were no cleaner than our squats; for most adults, getting out of bed in the morning was a feat.\n\"Hang on a tick!\" A medic in a white coat, one of the ones who'd taken Zach, was hurrying down the hall. \"You look like a strong boy,\" he said. \"Come here and help your father for a few ticks?\"\n\"Okay,\" I said.\nWhat else did I have to do? Anyway, how could I say no to a medic in a hospital asking me to help out?\nHe led me down the hall, into a tiny room with a window that looked at a brick wall. There was a girl in the room, in a clean white nightgown, sitting beside a bed. She looked at me. She had a mask on, with a long tube that led to a big hissing machine that was accordioned in the center. It pumped up and down. When it pumped down, the girl's chest went out, and when it pumped up, her chest went in. It was breathing for her.\n\"What's wrong with her?\" I asked.\n\"Syrell is a natural-born,\" the medic said. \"Her nervous system didn't form perfectly, but she's doing very well.\" He lifted her arm by the wrist, and she just let it dangle there in his hand. She didn't look nervous. She was a bit older than me, maybe fifteen. Her skin was white, her hair all clean and combed like an adult's.\n\"See here,\" the medic said, pointing to a crank on the machine. \"I need you to power this up to last the night. Two hundred turns should do it. Can you do two hundred?\"\nI laughed. \"I done a thousand turns at the pub once, for a basket of chips.\" I rubbed my belly, to show how much I fancied chips. I started cranking. It was a fine, quiet crank. The medic gave me the okay sign and left. There wasn't many adults like him around, bright-eyed and talking about something that mattered. I guess that's why he was a medic.\nThe girl looked at me, her chest rising and falling.\n\"What's your name?\" she said. Her voice was airy and muffled, like she was talking through her nose, because of the mask.\n\"Whistle,\" I said.\n\"Will you tell me,\" she paused right there in the middle, \"about things you do?\" I figured it out then, that she could only talk when her chest was falling.\n\"Things I do? You mean, just, what I do every day?\"\nShe nodded. I guess she never got to do much of anything, if she had to stay hooked to a machine to breathe. Too sad. And she was pretty\u2014a bit scrawny and twisted, but a pretty face\u2014and she had all her teeth, straight and whole. Too sad.\nSo I told her about running with my mates, swimming, hunting the tunnels, the games we played. She listened hard. I could see it, in her face, how hard she was listening, like I was telling her where to find canned goods or something. It was nice, being listened to like that, and it took my mind off Caryn and Krik. I was way past two hundred cranks, but I kept on.\nI told her about Toss the Bones, and she smiled. Air hissed out the edges of the mask.\n\"Yeah, it's fun. Makes it not such a big production, kissing. Makes it a game.\"\n\"Will you kiss me?\" she said, then looked away.\nIt took me totally by surprise. \"I'd want to,\" I said. \"But I can't, because of the machine and all.\" I waved my free hand at the breathing machine. I'm not sure if I meant it or not; she was pretty, like I said, but the machine made her sort of freakish. Nice, but freakish. Plus, I wasn't sure I ever wanted to kiss a girl again.\n\"You could, though.\" Pause for the inbreath. \"Kiss me.\"\n\"I don't see how.\"\n\"Take off the mask.\" Pause. \"Kiss me and,\" pause, \"slip it back on.\"\n\"Oh.\" I looked at her, not sure what to say. She smiled at me, a sweet smile, with no sexy in it. I didn't have much choice now; I couldn't very well say I wanted to, then say I didn't. It would be cruel, wouldn't it? \"Um, okay, then.\" I got up, squatted next to her chair.\nI reached for the mask, then stopped short. \"How long can it stay off?\" I asked.\nShe shrugged. \"Ten ticks?\"\nI nodded, grasped the mask and pulled it over her head. I kissed her, with one hand around her shoulder, the other holding the mask. She barely moved her mouth, like she didn't know how to do it. Probably her very first kiss, I thought. She might remember it her whole life. I didn't imagine that would be too long, though. It felt nice, but strange; I was breathing heavy, but she wasn't breathing at all.\nWhen I thought it'd been about seven ticks, I put the mask back on, and her chest puffed right out. She closed her eyes, looking dizzy. For a few outbreaths she stayed like that. Then she opened her eyes and looked at me.\n\"Again?\" she said.\nI nodded, took off her mask and kissed her again. This time she did better, she kissed me back.\nWhen I pulled off and gave her the mask, there were tears coming down her cheeks, but I could see by her face it was happy crying. That was nice, that she was happy I was kissing her. If only Caryn had cried when I kissed her.\nWe went on for maybe ten minutes, and then I said I should go, because the medic might come in. She said \"Once more,\" so we did one more. Then I squeezed her hand, but she didn't squeeze back.\nIt dawned on me then\u2014she hadn't moved her hands or feet the entire time. I took her hand by the wrist, the way the medic had. It dangled.\n\"You can't move?\"\nShe shook her head no.\n\"Not at all? Ever?\"\nShe shook her head no.\nToo sad. She was worse off than the adults. I kissed her cheek and got up.\n\"See you again?\" she said as I opened the door.\n\"Yeah, sure.\" I gave her the okay sign and closed the door. Yeah, I'd come back. Maybe not to kiss, though. I couldn't see myself going with her steady. I didn't think she was looking for a steady, just some fun. Didn't appear she was having much fun. Maybe next time I'd bring round some of my mates.\nI stepped outside and walked round the hospital, toward my squat. I'd collect my things and be out before Krik got back.\nJust thinking of Krik made me ache. I played it back in my mind again, him kissing Caryn, and felt the sting of it all over again. I didn't want to think about it, but it was like picking after lice: I couldn't stop even though I knew it only stirred things up.\n\"Son? Hold up there son.\"\nWhat in bloody hell did they want now? I turned toward an open door. The medic was there, and an adult woman, holding hands with a little tyke of a girl, maybe four years old. The medic said something to the woman, she nodded, and he left. She led the tyke across the pavement.\n\"This is Lala,\" the woman said. \"She's ready to be on her own now, so would you be a good son and take care of her, till she gets settled and all?\"\n\"What? Why me?\"\n\"Because you're responsible,\" she said.\n\"Oh, come on! No one took care of me when I was ready.\"\nThe tyke's eyes were circles. She looked up at me, then hid her face in the woman's legs.\nThe adult sighed, like she was real tired, and put her pocked hand on the tyke's head. \"There weren't too many older than you, were there? We took care of you till you were older than this one. We did our best. There are so many of you and most mothers and fathers are too sick to help.\"\nGuilt and the Bad Times, it was all they knew. But I tried to imagine those adults in the park looking after a tyke.\n\"Here, give her to me,\" I said.\nShe put the tyke's hand in mine, and told me what a good son I was. The tyke started crying as soon as the door closed.\n\"There you go, tyke,\" I said. \"You're okay. I'll take good care. What's your name again?\"\nShe just went on crying, but came along when I led her off. Two blocks of me telling her all the fun things she would do and she quieted.\n\"Who's this? You have a new girlfriend?\" I spun around. Caryn was crossing the street between two junkers. The only person I wanted to see less than Caryn was Krik. At least Krik wasn't with her, holding her hand.\n\"A creche mum gave her to me,\" I said. I turned to move on, like I had some place to get to.\nCaryn studied my face, like I had a leech on it or something. \"She gave her to you?\"\n\"Yeah, that's right. She asked me to look after her.\" I put my fingertips on the tyke's head.\n\"What's your name?\" Caryn asked, squatting.\n\"Lala,\" the tyke said.\n\"You have pretty hair, Lala,\" Caryn said, brushing her hair behind her ear.\nLala wiped her nose and nodded.\n\"Why you?\" Caryn asked me.\nI shrugged. \"I was helping out at the hospital a bit. She said I was responsible.\"\nCaryn nodded. She was looking at me peculiar again.\n\"Well, I need to get her settled,\" I said, taking a few steps down the sidewalk. My mind was replaying the kiss between Caryn and Krik again.\n\"Is something wrong?\" she asked.\nI shook my head. I didn't trust myself to answer. \"We'll be fine,\" I finally managed. \"Come on, Lala.\"\nCaryn tagged along beside me. \"You know, I only picked Krik because you were being such a child, not because I fancy him.\"\n\"You seemed to enjoy yourself plenty, even so,\" I said.\n\"Not so much, really, no,\" Caryn said. She walked so close to me that her elbow bumped mine, then her hand brushed past mine. \"I was glad you picked me, though. That's when I enjoyed myself, even if it was only a three-tick no-hands.\"\n\"How was I being a child?\" I asked. Had I been? It was all fuzzy now, except for the kiss.\n\"Besides tripping poor Zach? You acted like you expected I was going pick you, all cocky like.\"\n\"I guess I did. I'd had a bit too much to drink. Sorry.\"\nShe looked at me. \"That's nice of you to say.\"\nHer hand brushed mine again. This time I reached out for it. Caryn slipped her hand into mine. We laced our fingers together. All of a sudden, this was the best night of my life.\nRaindrops began to patter the sidewalk. Caryn turned her head up and opened her mouth to catch drops. In the distance, the adults began to scream.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by William D. McIntosh.

Still single at age thirty-five, an inheritance allowed David to dedicate himself to his real passion, the study of chronophysics, and his creation, the chronographic loopback engine.\nDavid's heart raced. He stood paralyzed for a moment, but found the courage to speak. \"Do you mind if I watch?\"\nShe started sketching details of the river, waiting an excruciatingly long time before she said, \"You may watch me, or my sketch \u2013 your choice.\"\nAlthough he could not see her face, David could feel her smiling. He watched a little of the sketch, and a little of her. She spoke without putting down her pencil, continuing to draw as she said in a playful tone, \"What's your name, art critic?\"\n\"David Fountain.\"\nShe set down her pencil and turned around. \"I'm Vera,\" she said. \"No last name, just Vera. How do you like the sketch?\"\nIf the likeness was striking before, now it was brilliant. \"Amazing,\" David said.\nVera folded her sketchbook, then her easel. \"Since you liked my sketch so much, I'll sell it to you for a cup of coffee.\" The sketchbook went inside the easel, and then she slung the easel over her shoulder with a strap.\nWhat great timing. Of all the days to test the chronographic loopback engine, he met a fabulous woman. If theory holds, David could live this day again and again. If the theory was wrong, she would still be there. \"There is a coffee shop just a block past the river.\"\nVera smiled, putting her hand inside David's right elbow as they walked to the coffee house, making small talk all the way. When they arrived, they sat at a cozy table and each ordered a cup of decaf.\nAfter more small talk, and long after the coffee was gone, Vera held both of David's hands and looked into his eyes from across the cozy table. \"David, do you believe in love at first sight?\"\n\"I never used to,\" he said, \"but I'm pretty sure I do now.\"\n\"I'm glad, because I think I'm feeling it.\" She flashed her baby blues and David felt a tingling in the nether regions.\n\"Me too,\" he said.\nAfter coffee, David and Vera were officially a couple. They stashed the easel at David's house, then relaxed in a movie, had a steak dinner, browsed for almost two hours in the used book store, then went dancing at one of the local college clubs. They left at two in the morning, stopping at David\u2019s to pick up the easel before continuing to Vera's apartment.\nShe invited David inside, and they sat on the couch together. The small talk started, but softly fell away as their eyes met. They kissed with eyes closed. A passionate kiss it was, as two lovers separated for a year might kiss when reunited. He placed his hand on her breast.\nThe air was cool, and the warmth of Vera's body vanished. He stood in front of the chronographic loopback engine. The atomic clock read 15:00:17.\nHis time with Vera never happened. He never kissed her, never looked into those baby blues. Then it hit him. The experiment was a success. The loopback engine worked, and Vera was sketching on the bridge. David ran out the door.\nHe could see her at the center of the span, drawing on her easel. He picked up his pace, scrambling over a small hill to save a few paces. By the time he got to the bridge, he was winded, but couldn't let anything keep him from getting to her.\n\"Vera!\" he called as he approached. He used short steps to slow himself. \"Vera. Dear God, I thought I lost you.\" He couldn't wait to see those baby blues.\nDavid's breath was heaving from the exertion. Vera turned toward him, eyes under a furrowed forehead. \"Do I know you?\" she asked.\nShe didn't have the same memories; David had to force himself to remember that. \"Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.\"\n\"No,\" she said, \"You called me Vera.\"\n\"I suppose I did.\" This was a clumsy beginning.\nShe did not go back to her drawing. Instead, she remained focused on David with that furrowed brow. \"How do you know my name? I don't know you.\" Her tone was accusatory. \"Are you stalking me?\"\n\"No.\" It was a mistake to run. David had walked the first time. Time to change the subject. \"I am a big fan of your sketches. May I see this one?\"\nVera turned back to her drawing, snapped the sketchbook closed, and folded the easel. She put the sketchbook inside and slung it over her shoulder. As she walked away, she said, \"I've never displayed my work in public. Keep away from me, you creep!\"\nCreep? From my Vera? \"Wait!\"\n\"Keep away.\"\nDavid started to follow, but checked himself. He had the chronographic loopback engine at his disposal. If he set the loop, he could find her and try again and again, until he finally won her back. When he won her back, he would turn the chronographic loopback engine off and stay with her.\nDavid spun about and raced back to his garage. It was still set to twelve hours. He decided to leave it alone for his first try. The atomic clock read 15:45:51. David pushed the button.\nHe walked back to the bridge to discover that Vera had returned with her sketchpad. This time, he walked across the span to her easel. \"I'm sorry for the way I acted before.\"\nShe must not have heard David coming, for when he spoke, Vera was startled. She inhaled sharply, then exhaled slowly. \"Oh, it's you again. Can't you take a hint?\" She folded her sketchpad and was reaching for the easel. This might be David's last chance. He grabbed Vera's arm and said, \"Please\u2014\"\nVera struggled to pull her arm away. \"Let go of me!\"\n\"Let me explain!\"\nVera's face turned bitter. \"Let. Me. Go.\"\n\"But\u2014\"\nHis response was cut short by a very large hand grabbing his forearm and squeezing very hard. \"The lady said to leave her alone,\" said a booming voice. David's eyes followed the heavily tattooed arm to the source. At the other end, he found a very large and very mean-looking biker type, long hair under a bandana and tied in a ponytail.\nDavid released Vera's arm.\n\"Thank-you,\" she said to the biker. \"This loser keeps harassing me.\"\nThe biker turned to look David in the eye. \"He won't bother you again.\"\nVera packed her sketchbook into the easel and again slung it over her shoulder. As the biker and Vera walked away together, David heard Vera say to the biker, \"Want to go get a cup of coffee?\"\nDavid stood on the bridge with his mouth agape, watching as the biker and his girl disappeared behind a building. Without knowing what else to do, he went home and turned on the television. When he got hungry, he ate. When he got tired, he went to bed.\nThe atomic clock read 15:45:57, and David pushed the button. This time he decided to try a different tactic. Knowing that Vera returns to the bridge, he detoured to the local flower shop to purchase a dozen roses. During the walk to the bridge, he struggled with how to hold the flowers when he approached her on the bridge. Should he hold them proudly in front, or should he conceal them behind his back? All too soon, he was at the bridge. He made his decision: behind the back.\nOnce again, David made his way to the girl with the easel. He walked slowly, stopping ten paces short. She did not look away from her sketchpad.\n\"Vera.\"\nAs she turned to look, David brought the flowers to the front, timing carefully so she would see the gesture.\n\"You again.\"\n\"I'm sorry if I frightened you,\" David said.\nVera smirked. \"I'm not frightened of you.\"\nDavid moved a few steps closer. She turned to face him with her hands behind her back. When he got within a few feet of her, Vera said, \"I'm not frightened. I'm pissed. Leave me alone.\" She brought her hand around and sprayed some kind of aerosol into David's eyes.\nIt burned, Lord, it burned. Pepper spray, damn her! He tried to open his eyes, but couldn't. The light hurt. Flowers dropped to his feet as he brought his hands to his eyes. Eyes burning, David dropped into a crouch.\n\"Serves you right, you sicko.\" He could hear Vera packing her easel.\n\"I wasn't trying to do anything, I swear!\" There was no answer. \"Vera?\" Still nothing. David used his shirt sleeve to dab the tears out of his eyes, then he opened them to look for Vera. With blurry vision, he could see the bridge was empty.\nAfter another ten minutes of dabbing his eyes, David decided to walk home and take a nap on the sofa for a few hours, but he couldn't sleep. Thinking about Vera made him angrier and angrier. What was that woman's problem? Why had she been so sweet and gentle the first time, but a raving lunatic bitch now? He walked to his home office, took a ceramic monkey from his desk and hurled it against the wall, where it shattered with a less-than-satisfying ker-thunk.\nThe eye drops in his desk drawer help a little, but the membranes inside his eyelids were still swollen like engorged pretzels. Maybe it wasn't worth it.\nHow long? He looked at the clock on his desk, it read 5:23. Over nine and a half hours before loopback. Aargh. He put his head down on his desk and drifted off to sleep.\nIt was dark when he woke up. After fumbling to find the lamp on his desk, he switched it on and looked immediately at the clock. 9:13.\nHis eyes felt better, but now he had a splitting headache. He wiped the patina of sweat from his brow using the back of his hand, then wiped his hand on the breast of his shirt. With a deep sigh, he got to his feet and walked to the garage, where he passed the chronographic loopback engine with its atomic clock still ticking away the time. He didn't know where he was going, but he didn't want to stay here.\nDavid wandered across the bridge and walked past the coffee house where he and Vera never had coffee. The shop was dark, tables pulled across the inside of the door. It probably wouldn't stop a thief, but perhaps made the owner feel better. As he sauntered by, he peered at the table where they never sat, not bothering to stop for a better view, yet not able to look away until he passed the window.\nHe kept walking until he stumbled upon a tavern that his intuition told him to enter. Inside was dark. The lighting consisted mainly of beer signs and gaudy stained glass lamps hanging over the pool tables. David walked past the tables and sat on a barstool. Elbows propped chin on the bar while the bartender dried mugs, dipping the tops in water before placing them into a freezer. Pansy-ass way to make frosted mugs.\nThe bartender glanced at David, put down the mug he was working on, and walked over. \"What'll it be, pal?\"\n\"I don't know,\" David said. \"Surprise me.\"\n\"You want beer, wine, or something harder?\"\n\"Harder is better.\"\nThe bartender focused his attention on mixing the surprise cocktail as David buried himself back inside his hands. What a way to spend a life, repeating mistakes. No, not repeating, making them worse. Every iteration of this experience had spiraled out of control, yet he couldn't get Vera out of his mind. Of all times to . . . oh, hell. He looked up at the bartender and watched him add some brown liquid to his glass. When he finished, he poked a toothpick through two cherries and dropped it on top, then added a straw and set the glass down in front of David.\nHe plopped ten bucks on the bar and said, \"What is it?\"\n\"A variation of a Long Island iced tea.\" The bartender set his change in front of him, but David didn't bother to collect it. Instead, he took a rather long sip from the straw.\n\"Make another.\"\nThe bartender nodded, then went to work on his assignment. David tossed his straw on the bar and went back to work on his own assignment, stopping only when he ran out of money. The beauty of it was that the money would soon be back in his pocket.\nHe tossed back the last of his last drink and noticed that the tavern was full of people now. When did they arrive? He decided he didn't care. He didn't care about much. In fact, all he cared about was sleep.\nDavid decided to walk home and spend the rest of the night in bed. He rose from the barstool and fell to the ground. The floor was a place to sleep, too.\nThe drunk was gone, and he was back in the garage in front of the chronographic loopback engine. The atomic clock read 15:46:05, and David felt fine. Did he want to push the button again? He decided to push the button, but he also decided not to go to the bridge this time. To hell with Vera. Try something different.\nDavid decided to drive to the Indian casino. His mind was returning to the experiment. What better way to test the chronographic loopback engine than with games of chance? He started at the slot machines and began his day with a lucky combination that spat out fifty quarters. That should be easy to remember.\nHe played for hours, winning a little and losing a lot. By the time he ran out of money, he didn't have long to wait before he was whisked back to the lab. He repeated the experiment three more times. In his second try, David broke even. In his third try, he lost all his money quickly and wandered around the casino watching other patrons to kill the time. Neither iteration repeated his fifty-quarter early success. He wondered why, but not for long. There would be time for that later.\nOn the third time he repeated the casino experiment. He not only repeated his early success, he hit the sweet spot. The machine spilled quarters on the floor and they kept pouring out. Lights flashed and sirens blared. A crowd gathered around, and the casino staff rushed over to pat him on the back. He was the day's biggest winner. As the casino staff gathered his quarters, he saw one man pull a ticket from the front of the machine. The employee looked up at David and said, \"It is your lucky day, sir.\"\nDavid looked around the floor where the other employees were still gathering coins. A few bystanders snatched up an occasional quarter, but David didn't care that much. \"I certainly won a decent pile of quarters.\"\n\"It's not just the quarters,\" the casino employee said while holding up the ticket. \"This ticket is worth three hundred thousand dollars.\"\nDavid's jaw fell open as if to say something, but no sound emerged. Three hundred thousand dollars? It was still early. He could turn off the chronographic loopback engine and stay in this timeline. He wasn't rich, but the money would go a long way toward raising his standard of living and helping him to forget Vera.\nThe casino insisted that David stay for photos, to sign papers, to file a tax form, and to be the guest of honor at an impromptu celebration. It was after ten o'clock when David finally managed to get out of the casino.\nHe decided to go straight home, but had to stop for some gas. To hell with Vera, he was rich! He had to turn off the chronographic loopback engine to stay in this timeline, but the tank was running on fumes. Gas first.\nThe station was closed, but the pumps were equipped with credit card readers. As he put the hose back on the pump, David felt somebody grab the collar of his shirt from behind, clothes-lining him.\nLying on his back away from the lighting, he couldn't make out the assailant's face, only the shadow of a large man holding a pistol. The figure aimed the pistol at David and fired. The entire world was pain. The only other thing he noticed was the shadow rifling through pockets, and ultimately taking the check from the casino. Every cell in David's body wanted to protest, but didn't have the strength.\nWeaker and weaker, he lay bleeding from his chest. His assailant was long gone, and in the dark, it would be a miracle if anyone found him. Mercifully, he lost consciousness.\nAlive and well, David stood in front of the chronographic loopback engine; the atomic clock read 15:47:12. He felt his chest where the bullet never penetrated. He was whole and without pain.\nShould he push the button again? Physically, he wasn't tired in the least. David felt the same as he did before the first experiment, the one where he met Vera. In reality, he had been in the garage for under an hour.\nShould he push the button again? Every time he pushed that button, things got worse. What if he didn't push the button and things got worse. How could things get worse than being shot? Then, he realized that the thesis wasn't true. The first three trips to the casino had mixed results. It was only on the fourth try that he won, and then was shot. What if he just stayed in the garage? By staying in the garage, he would have almost instant access to the chronographic loopback engine, and could switch it off if nothing happened.\nHe pressed it, then sat to ponder why the results varied so much each time. The iterations involving Vera had different outcomes because he tried different actions, but the casino should have had identical results each time. Yet they were very different.\nWhat was the difference? He looked up at the atomic clock. It read 16:01:46, and while watching the seconds figure change to 47 to 48 to 49, and 50, he figured it out. The initial conditions always changed. He could never start the chronographic loopback engine trials at exactly the same point in time because he could not freeze time. Chaos theory dominates any complicated system, and the world is about as complicated as a system gets. You can't go back, and the results in any given trial would always be radically different from the natural time stream \u2013 the time stream in which Vera loved him. David was no longer a part of that time stream. He was here. What was he now a part of? Would he step outdoors into nuclear war? Would an asteroid collide with the earth? Would he rescue a lost puppy?\nEach world seemed worse than the one before, and in the last, he was shot and maybe even died. There was no way to be sure. If this was worse . . . David didn't want to think about it. He suddenly felt the urge for a cup of coffee. To get coffee, he had to walk across the bridge, past Vera and her easel. Well, he didn't have to stop.\nAs the bridge came into view, he could see Vera and her easel, but something was wrong. She was struggling. David sped up to a jog, and as he got closer, he could tell that Vera was struggling to get free from the biker. It was the same biker that stole her away a number of iterations ago. David went into a dead run.\nRacing across the span, David made for the easel. He heard Vera screech. Almost there. Hold on, Vera! David ran as hard as he could and slammed head-first into the biker.\nBoth men tumbled along the sidewalk. David felt himself lifted to his feet just before he felt a fist meet his face. Down he tumbled again. As he struggled to stand, he caught sight of an incoming boot, then felt a sharp pain in his ribs, synchronized with a cracking sound.\nIt had to be a rib. It hurt to move, much less try to stand, but anything he could do to keep that biker away from Vera, David would try. After all, he would be standing in front of the chronographic loopback engine if he never turned it off.\nDavid managed to get to his knees and wondered why the biker let him get that far. What happened to the biker? What happened to Vera?\nLooking to his right, David found the handrail of the bridge. He used it to pull himself to his feet, then looked around to find Vera and the biker. He found Vera standing over the biker's unconscious body, her shattered easel still tightly grasped in her fists. Shards lay scattered about the biker's head. The paper with her sketch skittered across the pavement. Vera let it go.\nDavid staggered toward her, and when she noticed him, the easel fell to the ground. She ran to him, but thankfully, stopped short and didn't touch.\n\"You saved me,\" she said.\n\"I cou\u2014\" Talking hurt like hell. \"I couldn't let anything happen to you.\"\nShe stared at David for a moment, but not long enough for David to say anything. \"I was wrong about you,\" she said.\n\"It's okay.\" David leaned back against the rail and grasped his ribs, wincing from the pain.\n\"We need to get you to a doctor.\"\nVera took a step toward him, but he suddenly shouted, \"No!\"\nThe outburst froze Vera in her tracks. She looked at him with a curious expression. \"You need a doctor.\"\n\"That can wait,\" he said. \"I need your help. There's something I need to do first.\"\n\"You need a doctor.\" She dialed her cell phone, speaking too softly for David to hear. He hoped it wasn't a 911 call. Despite his injuries, this was the timeline he wanted to keep. It was the closest he was likely to get to the original. He had to get home.\nDavid took a step, a painful step that shot pain through his entire body. He grabbed for the bridge rail and sank to his knees. Eyes closed to combat the pain. He felt a hand on his back.\n\"Don't try to walk,\" Vera said. \"You'll only make your injuries worse.\" She helped David to sit. He was grateful for the help.\n\"I need to get home.\"\n\"An ambulance is on the way,\" Vera said.\n\"No time for that.\" David tried to stand, but again the pain shot through his body. It was no use. Vera was right: he needed a doctor. \"I'll see the doctor if you'll do something for me.\"\nVera took his hand. \"What is it?\"\nThere was hope, then, but would she do it? \"There is a machine in my garage. It must be turned off.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. \"You probably have broken ribs. Why can't it wait?\"\n\"I can't explain. It just has to be turned off now.\" She had to believe. No more looping back, no more losing her.\nVera's face softened. \"After I see you to the hospital.\"\nDavid reached into his pocket. With pain, he brought out his keys and dropped the ring into Vera's hand. \"The address is 1847 Juniper. Inside the garage, you'll find a machine with a digital clock. Just unplug the machine.\"\nThe faint wail of a siren pierced the air, growing louder every moment. The ambulance would arrive soon. Vera kissed David on the forehead. \"I'm not leaving you.\"\nVera clearly didn't understand. Never mind; she didn't have to understand. The only thing that mattered to David was staying in this timeline. \"Please, I don't want to lose you again.\"\nVera shook her head. \"You aren't making any sense. I don't even know you.\"\n\"But I know you, and I know how I feel about you.\"\nThe paramedics wheeled David into the emergency room with Vera on their heels. They pushed him into triage, where he was directed to the waiting room with the other non-critical cases.\n\"What time is it?\" David asked Vera.\nShe looked over her shoulder. \"It's 8:35.\"\nSeven hours. David fidgeted despite the pain.\n\"What's the matter?\" Vera asked.\n\"Why don't you run over to the house while I'm stuck in the waiting room?\"\nVera took his hand in hers. \"I don't want to leave you until they let you see the doctor.\" She released David's hand to stroke his hair. \"Try to get some rest.\"\nDavid closed his eyes, but he couldn't sleep. How could he? Besides the pain shooting through his chest from broken ribs, there was also the stress of not knowing whether Vera would cooperate and turn off the chronographic loopback engine. It felt good to have Vera in the hospital by his side. That was why he wanted to stay in this timeline.\n\"I'll be fine, and at this rate,\" David said, \"I'll still be waiting when you get back.\"\nVera shook her head. \"I can't leave you.\"\n\"Please.\"\nVera took David's hand, then sat back in her chair, planting herself for the duration.\nDavid closed his eyes. Would nothing go his way?\nIt was 2:50 in the morning before the nurse came to wheel David into the back. Vera tried to let go of his hand, but David wouldn't release her.\n\"Vera,\" he said, \"Please, go now. It has to be done now or I'll never see you again.\"\n\"That's crazy, David,\" she said. \"I'll be right here waiting for you.\"\n\"I'll be gone.\"\n\"Let go of my hand,\" Vera said, \"the nurse is getting angry. I'll be waiting for you.\" David loosened his grip and Vera pulled her hand free.\nAs the nurse wheeled his gurney through the double doors, David tried one last time. \"Please do it? If you care about me, shut the machine down!\"\nThe clock on the wall read 3:54. David's eyes glanced at it regularly. Only about five minutes before he would be snapped out of this timeline and lose Vera yet again. She was a loyal woman, but it didn't matter if she stayed at the hospital. She was about to be taken away. Again. A trace of a tear formed in his eye as he glanced at the clock. 3:55.\nThe doctor came into the room with a large x-ray film. \"Let's see how your ribs look.\" He slapped the film into the holder before punching the light switch. The x-ray flickered into view. David glanced at the clock. The second hand had moved by twenty seconds.\nThe doctor spent another minute and twelve seconds looking at the film. 3:57. The doctor turned around to face David, who glanced at the clock yet again.\n\"It could be a lot worse, Mr. Fountain.\" The doctor opened a drawer to remove a small pointer, and used it to point to the x-ray. David glanced at the clock. 3:58. The doctor traced a line on the image of David's ribs, then repeated the tracing on two other ribs.\n\"You don't have any broken ribs,\" the doctor said, \"but three of them are cracked.\"\nDavid moaned. \"They sure feel broken.\" He glanced up at the clock again. 3:59.\n\"You seem to be something of a clock-watcher,\" the doctor said.\n\"Something is about to happen.\"\n\"Oh?\" The doctor had a look of disdain on his face, as if to say he was too busy to deal with the delusions of a patient. If only it were a delusion. \"I would offer to wait for the special event with you, but I still have many patients to see.\" He took a step toward the door. \"Now that I've seen the x-ray, I can give you something for the pain. I'll be back in two minutes.\"\n\"That might be too late.\" David said it under his breath, and if the doctor heard him, he didn't acknowledge. Instead, the doctor simply rushed out the door into the hallway. David glanced at the clock again. 4:00. Vera's time in the waiting room was almost at an end. In another minute, David would be standing in front of the chronographic loopback engine inside his garage, once again a victim of ruthless chaos. When would he again have the gift of initial conditions allowing Vera's favor?\nNo more tries. It's not worth the multiply broken heart. That hurt far more than multiple cracked ribs. David looked back at the clock. 4:01 came and went. David watched the second hand rotate around the dial, waiting for the pain to disappear and the hospital room to change into his garage \u2013 waiting for the dial of the wall clock to change into the red digital readout of the atomic clock.\nThe second hand passed the twelve, making the time 4:02. The hospital room didn't disappear. His ribs still hurt. A smile spread across David's face. Vera did it after all.\nJust then, the door opened and the doctor walked in. \"You're still here, Mr. Fountain.\"\nDespite the pain, David laughed. \"Yes, I'm still here, and cracked ribs never felt so good.\"\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Rick Novy.

Two hundred floors of floating ant trails continually crisscrossing the sky meant the view consisted entirely of traffic.\n'The egg, sir?'\n'It only takes one, but my god if they all had the same idea at the same time we'd be done for, Kipple.' Greengrass turned to his assistant. 'The egg is aberrant thought. Free will. Call it what you like. All leads to the same thing: revolution.'\n'Prime Minister, surely you don't believe the common conveyance will lead to an insurrection?'\n'Only with all my heart, Kipple,' the Prime Minister said. 'And don't think I'm the first leader to think so either. But I will be the first to quash it, I promise that.\n'There is a rage in people, a rage they suppress until they seat themselves behind the controls of their conveyance. It lies below the surface, waiting for something to trigger it, and them, off. Until they lose control. And what is the one thing they want then, hmm? To seize control back and hurt those who took it from them in the first place. Blame God, you're a blasphemer. Blame your mother, you're a sociopath. Blame the government though, Kipple, and you're merely a voice of dissent. We're an easy target. The way I see it, more traffic means more rage and more rage incidents. More rage incidents means more dissent. More dissent, more chance someone will act to change the status quo. You see where I'm going with this, don't you?'\n'How do you propose to stop this, sir?'\n'Simple,' the Prime Minister said, turning his back on the city. A huge billboard drifted through the speeding traffic two hundred feet behind him, positional thrusters firing every so often to maintain its preset route through the city. It advertised a smorgasbord of government-approved anti-depressants (MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs, BRRIs, etc.) right alongside sugar-free carbonated drinks with which one might want to wash them down. 'Public transport,' stated Greengrass. 'Get them on the buses. Get them on the trains. We'll raise the cost of fuel so the common man can't afford to run his air-car. Keep them together and malleable. That's the key.'\nKipple slackened his tie and then rubbed the back of his neck. 'Prime Minister, isn't it folly to bring people together? To prevent insurrection we must place a wedge between them and drive them apart, yes?'\n'Any suggestion how?' Greengrass was unable to contain a smile. He could have Kipple eating out of his hand in less than a week \u2013 if he wanted it that way. Perhaps he would prove useful as a double agent. But Greengrass worked alone, trusting no one.\n'Promote competitive lifestyles,' Kipple answered. 'Reward individual achievement. Keep them busy fighting among themselves. But we mustn't put them together on buses . . . sir.'\n'It is a common misconception,' Greengrass began, 'but revolutions are invariably started by individuals, not groups. One man \u2013 or woman, let's not rule them out, hmm? \u2013 gets an idea in his or her head, becomes angry and passionate about it, and then it snowballs from there. Prime example: Adolf Hitler. Besides, have you ever been on a bus, Kipple? Ever seen the faces of its passengers? Slack. Empty. Docile. That's the way forward for New Britain.' Greengrass watched Kipple rub the back of his neck again before he continued.\n'But put someone inside an air-car and it changes them, the way they think and behave. It coils them tight like a spring. It gives them ideas. Then all it takes is that one spark, say, someone cutting you off and there it is, the rage breaking through the surface. And that, that, Kipple, is what gives rise to dogmatism. We don't want them having ideas. We don't want them believing they're right about such and such. So I repeat: get them on buses, get them on trains. It's why they voted to put me in this office \u2013 to change things for the better, right?'\n'It will be an unpopular move, Prime Minister.'\nGreengrass shrugged. 'Making things better doesn't necessarily make you popular.'\n'I meant not just with the voters, sir . . .'\n'Godsakes, take your testicles out of the Home Office's grip and think for yourself.' Kipple flinched. Greengrass bit down on his anger. His psychiatrists were wrong: the world was full of spies. 'The intelligence of any crowd,' he pressed on, regardless, 'is well known to reduce in inverse proportion to the numbers that make up said crowd. In other words, Kipple, people, like bananas, are stupid in bunches. Elections do not work. History has proved that. Six million dead Jews proved that. But it is the nature of the political animal, and until such time as it is not we have no choice but to live and work in the same cage.'\nKipple looked horrified. 'Is that your intention, sir? To abolish elections? How will we choose new leaders? You'll create a dictatorship . . . you'll . . .'\nPrime Minister Greengrass walked over and patted him reassuringly on the shoulder. 'Easy. Easy. One thing at a time, Kipple. One thing at a time. I think we are done here for today. Thank you for lending an ear. It helps. Don't be late tomorrow, although I understand you have to make your report. Unfortunate that. Remember to state clearly what it was I said: revolutions are started by rebellious groups.'\n'I don't know what you mean about a report, sir . . . Besides, didn't you say they were started by individuals?'\nGreengrass winked at him and said, 'Run along, Kipple.'\nHe left the office practically skipping. Greengrass felt a pang of sympathy for him. Just another H.O. puppet, he thought. 'Probably voted for me too,' he said, and laughed. They'd tried before and they'd try again. Usually, he saw to it that they were fired or transferred to another department, but Kipple was different. Greengrass had actually enjoyed having him around. He didn't just listen;, he had opinions. And now the kid had something to give the string-pullers back at the Home Office, perhaps enough to cut him free, perhaps only enough to entangle him further.\nGreengrass went over to the window and looked out once more on New London. His New London. Tomorrow the fuel costs would double. In a day or two, when he gazed from this window, his view of the city would be that much less obstructed, that much clearer. But change could only result from tough, unpopular decisions, and today he had made the first of many.\nHe left his office and took the hi-speed lift down to the conveyance hangar on one hundred, where his air-car awaited, not in its usual reserved space but in one he had chosen at random. Crossing the brightly lit hangar, the politician inside him basked in the sound of the tapping of his shoes \u2013 and only his shoes \u2013 across the concrete. He restrained himself from breaking into a dancing run. He reached his conveyance, got inside, and started its engines. He sat and waited a while. And then, at an altitude of two feet, he backed out of the space\u2014\n\u2014 directly into the path of another air-car.\nA screech and hiss of brakes.\nInside Greengrass's conveyance, proximity sensors bleeped wildly. His nearside view screen was flooded with blinding white, illuminating the interior. The other conveyance's headlights blazed into the tiny wing-mounted camera, less than a foot away.\n'Son of a bitch blindsided me,' Greengrass said. 'Well isn't this his unlucky day?'\nHe reached inside the glove box. Fumbling around, he eventually found what he was looking for: his gun. A cautionary measure. He had never had to use it before, but you never knew what kind of lunatic was sitting behind the controls of the other conveyance. You never knew.\nHe opened his door, stepped out, and walked towards Kipple's air-car.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Steven J. Dines.

I strain to free my eyelids of their\nicy coating. How long, I wonder? Centuries? Eons? I\nshiver at the thought of so much frozen time.\nI wiggle my fingers and toes and nod to acknowledge her inquiry as I stare about me.\nThe ceiling glows with a warm autumn light, tinged in russet hues. There is very little equipment \u2013 apparently these aliens are beyond the need for the vast array of medical facilities I had devised to revive the frozen. I vow to learn as much of their revival process as I can before, before... What is the thought trying to come to mind? I struggle, but cannot focus.\nA smaller triangular head peers over the creature's shoulder. \"Is it all right, Paula?\" he asks. I think it strange that I understand them, but my curiosity dies quickly, leaving placid acceptance in its wake.\n\"Yes, of course \" the female responds. \"Do you know your identity?\" she asks.\nI glance at the mirrored surface above me. I am nude and hairless and wear a tightly fitted helmet. Despite my nakedness amongst these aliens, I feel no distress. Is this perhaps some lingering, unexpected effect of the stasis, as much as my faulty memory and my strange, calm passivity?\n\"I am... Frost,\" I answer, and then add with greater certainty, \"Doctor Frost.\"\n\"And where are you from, Doctor Frost?\" she asks calmly.\nWould I be as calm if I were suddenly to find myself reviving an alien creature? Would I be able to confront an alien with such calm and aplomb?\n\"I am from the High Brasilia, in near Earth orbit,\" I respond. \"And whom do I have the honor of addressing?\"\n\"My name is Paula,\" she replies with a nonchalant wave of her hand in the direction of the smaller alien. \"And this is my... husband, Paul. We welcome you to the Christmas season and wish to have you help us celebrate.\"\nThere is a rote quality to her voice, as if she has said this many times before, but that question pales when I wonder how there could be a Christmas celebration here? This question makes my confusion worse. Just who am I?\nI'd easily recalled my name and where I had lived. But the reasons that I'd traveled frozen into the far future, never to return, was still unknown. No matter how I try, I cannot bring any personal memories to mind. Perhaps it is an effect of the revival process. I hope my memories will eventually return or I'll not be able to satisfy my hosts' almost certain desire for information about my origins. I reach up to remove the helmet so that I can sit up.\n\"No, no!\" Paula exclaims, placing an appendage atop the helmet and forcing my hands away with the others. \"You must wear this. It will help with the remembering.\"\nAh, her words show that I was right; she does have experience with this. She must have learned from others; perhaps I'd had shipmates or maybe instructions had accompanied me. But I could recall no such device as this helmet. Was that another failure of my poor memory?\n\"You are to stay with us,\" she announces in a way that brooks no refusal. \"We will enjoy having you.\"\n\"Your courtesy is appreciated, but I wouldn't want to disturb your home life,\" I stutter, expecting to be housed in some sterile examination facility where I would, no doubt, be visited by an endless stream of alien scientists, all anxious for the information that my mind refuses to divulge. Again, I strain to clear the fog that obscures it.\n\"It will be no bother,\" she assures me. \"Besides, my children love to see you and hear whatever Christmas stories you have to tell.\"\nAt that point I am frozen with amazement: Would I have been so trusting of an alien from the distant stars as to invite them into the bosom of my family? I think not, and that might be a difference between this kindly creature and myself, between her society and my own. Could it be that this is a gentler world? Poor beings, to be so vulnerable and innocent.\nWait a moment! For a split second I recalled that I had a family! But when I try to focus, the thought fades away until I can recall neither faces nor names. Give it time, I tell myself; give it time. Perhaps the mind revives much more slowly than the body.\n\"Mama, mama!\" Two smaller versions of the aliens race from the front door of a low-roofed building of strangely filigreed tiles and covered with faintly scented brush. The first to reach Paula is a yellow-crested lad, while the other has a back fin as dark as night. They tangle their arms with hers, and wiggle under her low-slung waist as she hugs them to her, laughing the while.\n\"These are my sons,\" she remarks, turning each to face me. \"This one is Dominik and the dark one is Slova. Say hello to Doctor Frost, boys.\"\nEach 'boy' stands very straight and then bends slightly at the waist. \"Pleased to meet you, sir,\" they recite together.\nThis formal courtesy astounds me. I have a vague feeling that this is not normal behavior for youngsters. There's an air of slight familiarity in their demeanor, as though I were some frequent visitor or that humans made occasional visits, but not quite so rare as to awe them.\n\"And this is my darling little Mishta,\" Paul says as he shows me the beautiful miniature clasped to his breast. \"She is my daughter,\" he pronounces proudly. \"Say hello to Frost,\" he prompts. Mishta giggles delightfully and turns to hide her face on Paul's shoulder, sneaking a small peek at me after a moment.\n\"I am very pleased to meet you, Mishta,\" I say stiffly and touch her tiny forearm with my finger. Children? A small thought had suddenly glimmered from the cold pit of memory. Had I children? Or had Evelyn refused, like so many of her contemporaries, because of the sad state of affairs on Earth?\nEvelyn! Memories of her appear from nowhere with sledgehammer force. Oh my God, how could I have forgotten sweet, darling, lovely Evelyn \u2013 the most wonderful thing that had ever happened in my life. The image of her perfect face comes clearly into my mind's eye; her golden hair, her blue, blue eyes, and the even, white teeth that glistened when she beamed that gorgeous smile of hers at me.\nI remember her lithe figure, the wonderfully athletic body that had entranced and fascinated me. She had been the perfect bride, the epitome of the new order of humanity that would inherit the stars. With a pang of regret I wondered why I had ever left. How many years have you been dead and gone, my love, I ask myself, as I sped through space and slept my way through the centuries? My heart aches at the memory of her sweet, sweet face.\nYet vague thoughts of children continue to bother me. Had Evelyn been my entire family, sufficient in every way? I strain to recall our life together, but with no success. Perhaps the answer will come in time. Again I resolved to wait: \"The helmet will help you with the remembering,\" Paula had said. I have no choice but to wait.\nThe two boys are leaping about the room the next morning when I come down to find that my hosts have prepared a breakfast of pancakes and fruits. I eat heartily along with them.\n\"Tell us about Christmas on Earth,\" plead the children. \"Tell us what the Earth children do at Christmas time.\"\n\"Now boys,\" Paula says softly as she presses closely to my side and adjusts something at the back of the helmet. \"There's plenty of time before Christmas. I think our guest needs time to settle in. I'm sure that he will tell us about Christmas whenever he is ready.\"\nI smile at her. \"It's not a problem. I do remember some things.\" And it is true. Without apparent strain, memories of my early childhood have come back to me. The words roll out as if from a well-rehearsed script. \"Now let's see, where shall I begin?\"\nI ponder the situation as a sense of wonder comes over me. How could these creatures, so alien and so distant from my home, have a holiday named Christmas \u2013 and that it should have so many similarities is beyond belief. Had the outpouring wave of humanity carried our sacred traditions ahead of me? How else could it have come about? I add it to the list of questions I will ask.\n\"Long before Christmas day the children would be all a-twitter with excitement,\" I begin. \"Parents would be unpacking the decorations and shifting the furniture to make a space for the tree. Whispered discussions about presents would be conducted where the recipient couldn't overhear - so naturally whenever adults started talking quietly every child would prick up their ears and listen intently, hoping to hear the slightest hint of what was to come. Presents would suddenly appear in the bottoms of closets and secret places in the basement and attics. Rolls of wrapping papers would disappear for hours as one person or another would secretly wrap some treasure. In the quiet times every child would make up a list of everything they wanted Santa to bring them...\"\nThe smallest boy, Slova, suddenly chimes: \"Tell us about the elves. You forgot about the elves!\"\nPaula claps a hand over Slova's mouth. \"Hush, Slova. You will hear about these things when it is time and not before. Please do go on, Frost.\"\nApparently the boys have heard much of this before, but from whom I cannot imagine. It is another mystery that I must clear up in time.\nI continue as if there had been no interruption. \"Once the children's lists were prepared, they would be sent to the North Pole with great fanfare. It was always best to mail them well before Christmas so there would be plenty of time for the elves to build the toys and treasures that Santa would deliver.\n\"Santa kept all of his elves in his workshops since they were not allowed to mingle among true humans. Nevertheless, even these defective creatures could create small wonders, given enough incentives by the ever-diligent supervision of Santa's men. The elves' skills crafted everything desired by truly human children. When the toys were completed, they stored them in charmed bags: No matter how many they put in these bags they could never be filled.\"\nDominik screws his head sideways until I think it will break. \"Then why did they need more than one bag?\" he asks.\nPaula intervenes once more and saves me some embarrassment: \"Come along boys; time to go to school. Perhaps tonight Frost will share some more memories. Now run along, and don't forget your lessons!\"\nDominik and Slova seem reluctant to leave my side for a moment and then, with a rush of limbs and scurrying of feet, they race out the door. \"Bye,\" they yell in unison.\n\"Such dears,\" Paula says softly. \"They are really excited about Christmas. They love your emotions so much.\"\n\"You mean my story, don't you?\" I reply.\n\"Yes, that's what I meant.\"\nLater, when I have an opportunity to reflect on the boys' reactions that morning, I recall the anticipation of my own children as the Christmas holiday approached: Little Fred asking his endless questions about the days remaining until Santa would arrive; Sam trying to act as if it didn't matter, but searching for his hidden gifts just the same, and Helen gazing with wondering eyes at every glistening decoration and light.\nEach of their faces comes into my mind as I recall their names. Sam and Helen bore Evelyn's finely chiseled features, while Fred favored my side of the family with his distinctive nose and chin. I remember mercurial Fred racing about as if there were never enough time to get everything done and trying to cram as much into each day as he could. I recall how Sam would ponder every aspect of his life with an air of gravity, weighing the simplest decision with grave import. Helen was a treasure, my own little girl whose outpouring of love threatened to smother all who came into her charmed circle. All had been blessed by the board soon after birth, further proof of Evelyn's and my own perfect humanity.\nAgain, why did I leave these treasures, my precious children behind? What happened to them? Where is the line of their descent into this present age? I have no other memories of them, no details save images of their physical appearance and brief, too brief mental sketches of their childish personalities. I pray that further memories will come in time.\nThat night I repeat what little I've recalled to the family as they huddle next to me, quite close. Their sensitivity to my emotional state seems strange; and that itself is another unanswered question to put with the many others, only a few of which I can recall. Despite repeated queries I am no closer to discovering the strange coincidence of this alien Christmas either. Both Paul and Paula evade every question I ask with a laugh and a \"later, dear Frost; you will have your answers later as a Christmas surprise.\"\nI embellish my descriptions of the anticipation of Christmas, repeating it for the occasional visitors and to the other children Dominik and Slova bring to me during the day. To a fault all are intensely polite and well mannered; a very civilized race. I wonder at the rapt expressions in their postures as I recall scenes of my youth with them sitting close to me.\nOne of the boys asks about how we prepared our houses for the season so I describe the sconces and the wreaths, the candles and the pictures, the heirlooms placed in their special places, the decorative bowls filled with sweets and fruits. I tell them about the lights and the decorations; a crystal cr\u00e9che and another of wood that father had picked up at a cull's house, a pair of china angels, a plate painted by my grandmother, and stockings knitted by the colonists for each child to hang by the fireplace. It was a mixed collection of bric-a-brac, but one permeated with love and memories.\n\"We must decorate our house too,\" Dominik says impulsively, pulling me to the great room. Without pause he reaches into a box and withdraws a spun glass angel of exquisite design that sparkles in the light. This angel, unlike those I remember, has its multiple legs spread wide and features the familiar triangular alien head.\nAs the day progresses the house begins to take on a festive air. Mishta scrawls a huge wreath onto the front door while we work elsewhere, unknowing of her artistic bent. Her childish masterpiece brings a scream from Paul when he arrives, which starts Mishta crying - a hacking sound much like a saw going through a tree trunk. Paula gives a hearty chortle and decides that it is just perfect and should remain there.\n\"This is so familiar,\" I say and begin speaking of my own Christmas memories, of loving family and good friends. By the time I finish telling what I could remember of those times, all of them are pressed tightly against me, as if copying the warmth of my mother's remembered embrace.\n\"We know how you must have felt,\" Paul says, drawing Mishta nearer his own side and stroking her back. The others echo his sentiment. A raspy noise that I'd learned was their equivalent of crying comes from Slova. I marvel at the emotional depths of these aliens, to think that my memories should affect them so much.\nNight comes and I lie abed, going over the events of the day, recalling the raspy laughter, when memories emerge of a similar sound in the background as a stiff subject lay on a slab. Was it something about preservation, persistence... my part in some experiment? Is it a memory from long before High Brasilia?\nThe subject's skin is bluish gray, the color of the recently drowned, and covered with a glistening coat of sticky fluid. Pipes emerge from beneath the table and converge on a face mask. Other, smaller tubes are attached to the subject's arms and legs, while a fiendishly wicked chrome pipe was inserted into her anus.\n\"Perfect stasis,\" Frogbottom remarked as he pinged the subject's frozen toe with his forefinger. \"She's been under for six months and we've seen no sign of deterioration. If this test is any accurate predictor, we should be able to keep her like this for years, decades even!\"\n\"No need to feed or house them, then?\" asked one burly man, wearing long military braid. \"We could keep a force in readiness as long as we need, right?\"\nAnother voice interrupted before I could answer. \"We need to think of how we can use this. Have you any suggestions, Frost?\"\n\"Perhaps I do, ... \" I recall saying, but the rest is lost to memory.\nMorning comes and I help Paula strip the husks from the yellowish vegetables she is preparing for dinner. Dominik asks. \"Can you help get a Christmas tree for our house, Frost? I know where we can find a nice one.\"\nPaula hesitates for a moment before responding. \"I think that you'd best wait until Paul comes back. After all, we don't want our guest working for us, do we?\" With a quick glance at the pile of vegetables in the pan in front of me she adds, \"Well, not hard work anyway. But, perhaps he can accompany you and Paul when you go to get the tree.\"\n\"Wow! We're going to get the tree!\" the boys shout together as they race around the room. Then both of them hurry to the front of the house where they await the arrival of their father.\nThe forest proves to be shrub land dotted with tiny globular bushes bearing little resemblance to the conical Christmas trees that I recall with such warmth. They pick one that seems the right size for the corner of the great room and Paul cuts it close to the base with a single swipe of a long-bladed knife.\nGetting it through the doorway and into the great room takes the combined efforts of both boys, Paul, Paula, and myself, for the branches are quite sturdy and bend only under heavy pressure. We get ninety percent of the tree through the frame when the final branches finally assert themselves and, with an explosive push, propel the tree, along with all of us, into the center of the room where we tumble in a tangled, laughing heap. Somehow they reflect the humor that I feel back to me and our laughter grows and grows until, exhausted, we lie silent on the floor.\nThe tree is too big for the space we had prepared. I guess that some things never change.\nThat evening we decorate the tree with ornaments that so closely resemble those that I remember that they bring tears to my eyes; drops of colored glass, balls with luminescent glory, spirals of gold and silver, and chains of crystallized light. When night comes and only the light from the small lamps Paul had affixed to the tree illuminate the room, I remember another Christmas, not of my youth, but of my later days. The family draws closer as I begin to speak.\n\"It had been Christmas eve when we gathered around the ceramic tree in our quarters. We couldn't have a real one on the station - bio-filters, you know. No, it was a masterpiece of the colonists' hands - more lifelike and perfect than any real tree could possibly be. Evelyn had adorned it with the bric-a-brac we'd accumulated over the years; gold and silver trinkets from our honeymoon visit to Mexico's processing center, bangles taken from the coastal drifters our ship's crew had encountered near New Orleans, little colored glass balls she had our colonists create in the zero-gee glasswork, and small knitted dolls and such that the colonial women knitted while they awaited processing.\n\"Our most prized ornament was a paper star that adorned the peak of the tree. It was a cheap thing; cones of gold-colored paper glued together to form a sphere of points with a spiral of wire beneath to hold it to the peak. Over the years several of the cones had come loose, and the gold was flaking from the others. Nevertheless, each year we took it from its box and carefully gave it the place of honor. It had been my own father's father's star, and one that rested atop their trees for years.\n\"We had finished a wonderful holiday feast, returned from church, and made an obligatory and terribly expensive, call to Evelyn's mother, who wouldn't remember the call ten minutes after we hung up, and then exchanged presents.\n\"Fred made me a nice platinum letter opener and gave his mother a nice bracelet made from scrap jewelry \u2013 diamonds, I recall. Sam gave me a bottle of scent, and for Helen he painted a picture of the station, with the colonists' ships racing away toward the edges, but done in bright fluorescent colors that bore no relationship to each other or the station's real coloring.\n\"What I wouldn't give to go back to that moment and touch that garish picture once more,\" I finish, with a feeling of immense regret as Paula and Paul rock back and forth with their children in their arms. I am becoming quite used to their habit of crowding close and am beginning to find their warmth and the fragrance of their herb-scented breath rather pleasant.\nA few days later I can remember more. \"Christmas was also a time of responsibility,\" I say at the beginning of the evening's story telling time. Only tonight, on Christmas eve, there are no guests. For some reason Paula turned away all who came instead of welcoming them in, as was usually the case. Paul reclines near the tree with Mishta draped over his shoulder.\nBefore I begin Paula makes a small adjustment to my helmet, then holds the two boys closely, as if to protect them, or maybe she is just holding on to them because one day too soon their youthful innocence will depart and it will no longer be proper to hug them so tightly. It is a quiet time. In the distance I can imagine church bells tolling out the call to services.\nI start to speak softly, placing words around the thoughts as they spring from the depths of my memory. \"In the evening, after the dinner dishes were put away, we would drive to our enclave's church. The congregation was a diverse group, with nearly every religion and sect represented. Everyone attended the same service since it was important for all of us to share. Even my agnostic uncles went, protesting laughingly all the way.\n\"But attending services was a responsibility to the family and to the great work. Responsibility was a big part of Christmas; doing things for others, renewing the ties of family and friends, giving deference to God, and serving as best you could.\"\nWith those words other thoughts begin to intrude, more sinister ones that do not spring from my lips but stay in my mind. I remember that shortly after putting the kids to bed I'd received a call: Could I come down for a few moments, they asked; there seems to be a little problem. With a tinge of regret I gave each child a quick kiss and left. After all, processing was my responsibility.\nThat was the last time I saw my dear children, I recall with horrifying clarity.\nBurning questions flare into being, absent of the references behind them: What disaster had befallen us? Was I culpable in exposing Brasilia to the danger? Could I have saved Evelyn and the children? Vague memories of the cull war raging on the surface of the Earth below flit through my head, but fail to clarify. I briefly recall watching the brilliant night-time glow of Earth's cities fade to black, one by one, the coastal areas becoming obscured by billowing clouds and flaring flames.\nI must have sought refuge in the Center, for I recall sleeping on benches or under a stasis table. One clear memory comes to mind with a rude shock: it is the steady boom, boom, boom of explosives as the enemy worked their way toward the heart of the station.\nI recall how we began to process the remaining colonists, marching them quickly from their pens to the chambers, moving them first by the dozens, and then the hundreds. We worked furiously, racing against time until the last was done.\n\"Your records, Hans,\" someone said. \"You must destroy your records at once.\" Then memory fails and I slump back, exhausted.\nFor a moment I reflect on how unkind fate is to deliver me into the hands of these kind and gentle people. How could they know that their very lives, their very selves, revive such painful memories, remind me of those precious four who had died so brutally and too soon? I almost yearn for the return to the nothingness of cold sleep; this time to wake no more, to cease remembering my bitter loss.\nI open my eyes to find Paula leaning over me in a posture of what appears to be rapture, so thrown back is her head. \"Are your memories too painful for you? Are you remembering too much?\" she pleas with anxiety evident in her voice as she reaches toward the helmet.\n\"No. Yes,\" I reply sadly and the recalled memories recede. \"I am starting to remember some things that don't relate to Christmas at all. Perhaps it is time for me to go to bed. I'm afraid my mood might spoil your Christmas eve.\"\nPaula protests vigorously, but in the end lets me leave the great room and the warm glow of the tree. \"We will have the feast of Christmas in the morning,\" she promises with rising excitement in her voice.\nThat night I quietly explore these new memories. The feeling that I must escape some unremembered pain is still with me. Momentarily I wish that I had awakened in some place so different that no reminder of my own sweet family would haunt me, but this alien realm reflects too many hints of what I'd lost. With these dark thoughts in my head I pray that I will not dream and fall asleep.\nThe next morning I wake with a tingling in my mind, as if some sleeping giant were about to awake. I can almost feel connections healing and synapses closing as my memories begin to climb out of their deep, chill pit at last.\nPaula and the children are waiting at breakfast, and what a breakfast it is! The table is spread with every type of fruit and herb, and some I have not seen before. Steaming beverages sit in little pots and a pitcher of my favorite drink stands tall before my place. I have not seen a meal like this since the morning I was frozen, although in that instance it was to build the carbohydrates and sugars in the blood, and not to celebrate the holiday.\n\"Do you approve?\" Paul asks anxiously.\n\"Indeed I do. Oh, yes. Most certainly. This is wonderful. How can I ever thank you enough?\"\nPaula smiles by turning her head. \"Perhaps you will share more of your memories after we eat? That would be payment in full.\" The children squeal in delight and begin gobbling their food as if they want to get the meal finished as quickly as possible. The feeling is contagious, for both Paul and Paula eat with unaccustomed speed.\n\"As soon as you're finished we'll go in the great room,\" she suggests politely as I slowly consume my food. I can feel the pressure of their stares as I chew my final portion, burp politely, and push back from the table.\nAs soon as I am comfortably settled Paula reaches behind the helmet. \"I think this is the final adjustment,\" she murmurs.\n\"Yes,\" I respond as her forelimb presses tightly against my arm, \"When I awoke this morning I felt that this would be a special day.\" And with those words the curtain around my memories dissolves as the morning mist before the rising sun.\nAn avalanche of images, concepts, places, and people fills every corner of my mind, jostling and chivvying for their proper positions. I recall a judge, a crowd of naked people screaming in an airless tiny room, Evelyn with a doll in her hand as little Fred plays with a toy truck of solid gold that one of the colonists had tried to sneak past emigration. I remember hesitating before a keyboard, unwilling to destroy the great work of my life, and of feeling the butt of a rifle hitting my shoulder, throwing me away from the machine.\nThe trial! I remember the trial; that mock justice the defectives staged over our noble mission, our true calling to prevent the unfit from further polluting man's seed and interfering with our destiny.\nThey accused me of being one of the leaders, the man who perfected the solution to Earth's genetic pollution. \"Frost,\" they had named me then; \"Doctor Frost.\"\nMy timetable would have succeeded if only the weak politicians who had initially swarmed to our banner had not lost heart. But my successes were not supported by their moral courage and so they had lost; humanity had lost, and now the cowards sought to cast me as a scapegoat to protect themselves. So be it, I cursed; let them stew in the mess they allowed to happen.\nHigh Brasilia was to be sent into the sun. Those defects, those misfits, those horrid genetic cripples all hated the station for its role of perfecting humanity and for its role in attempting to free our progeny from afflictions of mind and body. I pitied their inability to grasp the beauty of the great undertaking through the days and weeks and months of the trials, through the endless prattle of ill-informed tales and rumors.\n\"Where is this Charnel House?\" I remember yelling at one woman who screamed accusations of genocide at me. \"Stop spreading these lies,\" I cried out. \"Where is the evidence? Where are the bones, the fillings from their teeth? The colonists are speeding to the stars, as we promised. If you want them back then go and fetch them,\" I finished with a smile, knowing full well that she could not hope to reach those empty shells of ships \u2013 one per thousand colonists processed \u2013 that we had carefully launched each month to support our claims.\nThe defectives hoped that this trial would destroy the cause I supported. But they understood so little. I knew others would continue the great undertaking to purify our gene pool, others as appalled as I by the barbaric remnants of our animal ancestry. Time would prove the truth of our cause. Time would vindicate my work. When this sham trial was over I would continue the great mission.\nThen the trial erupted. My records from Brasilia were discovered, the ones that I failed to destroy, the ones that contained data about my experiments, about our operations.\nDay by day they played them out, detailing how the thousands of my erstwhile 'colonists' shivered and screamed, shuddered and shat, died of pain and cellular explosions, sat as vegetables when awakened, or were simply too weak to allow me to finish a series.\nIn the marginalia I'd kept my daily counts of the efficiency of the bulk processing. I had even, in a weak moment of hubris, committed a design of an improved high-capacity processing chamber to my files. I had been so proud of the solar furnaces we'd incorporated \u2013 even bridgework and fillings would vaporize under its fierce focus.\nNeedless to say we of the station, of all those who played a part, were held accountable. What a travesty of justice, I thought at the time, as they sentenced each of our loyal members to death.\nThey made me watch every execution; brutal, barbaric, hideous methods far different from the humane industrial practices I had perfected. At the end they throttled my precious Evelyn. I watched her eyes bulge, her lips turn blue with cyanosis, her tongue swell, and her lovely, pale face turn a deep, dark red. I watched with growing horror as her life was slowly extinguished and my wife, my beautiful wife was destroyed.\nThat same pain of loss stabs through me again and I feel the salt tears fill my eyes. Oh, the horror of her death, the pain and suffering she must have felt. At that moment I remember praying that they would take me next and still my aching heart. They could only kill me once for what I had done, and when that was done I would be free of the memory of her death.\nAs I return to the present I feel that I am being smothered. I open my eyes to discover the family crawling on top of me in postures of rapture. Paula and Paul are swinging their heads in ecstasy and the children are drooling with pleasure. \"More, more,\" demands Paula and wrenches the helmet from my head.\nCascading memories my mind. There is nothing I can do to stem the flow of emotion-laden memories that spring forth uncensored and with absolute clarity from the depths of my mind.\nHour after hour I remember the pain and agony of Evelyn's unnecessary, so mean-spirited death. She had never harmed anyone, never even taken a colonist's goods until after they had been processed. Such a moral person should not have suffered such an ignoble death. Each time this thought comes to mind Paul gives a groan of pleasure and Paula presses herself ever closer. I am drowning in memory and awash in horror.\n\"Please let this end,\" I plead tearfully as memories of my children's bodies being stacked with the others enter my thoughts.\nThrough it all I remember the uncountable times I have gone through this before. I recall the hundreds and hundreds of prior awakenings. They form a seemingly endless temporal corridor painted with scenes of repeated pain and suffering extending years and centuries into the past. How I had come to this; how long had this gone on, and how long it would continue are startlingly clear to me, a revelation of such depth that I am overwhelmed.\nThe butt of the judge's pistol came down on the desk as he pronounced the final judgment. \"There is only one punishment suitable for your crimes. I order you put to stasis and launched to the heavens where God will forge your fate.\"\nI remember laughing at his sentence, as if their weak God could possibly affect me. My God, the only true God, knows the true inheritors of the stars. My God had not intended for people only partly risen from the beasts to go forth, but had reserved that right for the pure humans.\nI welcomed the cold sting of pseudo-death, knowing that the inheritors of my kind would find me. When next I opened my eyes I would have evaded the punishment that they thought to give.\nWith that thought I realize that the helmet must have been suppressing memories, allowing Paula to eke them out for her family to savor before the emotional feast that I would now provide!\nPaula groans in ecstasy at my emotional reaction to my realization of the horror that is my destiny. There is no surcease until evening, when all are satiated.\nI embrace the balm of lost memory when Paula replaces\nthe helmet on my head and leads me to the slab. I lay\ndown and close my eyes, yearning for forgetfulness,\nbut knowing that I will wake again, I wonder how long\nit will be before Lethe finally envelops me in her\ncloak?\nCold. The first thing that I become aware of is the intense cold that permeates every cell of my body, a cold so deep that I feel as if the core of my heart is a frozen pellet, barely able to pump slush-filled blood through my frigid veins. I strain to free my eyelids of their icy coating, anxious to discover what wonders await me.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Bud Sparhawk.

The speed and surprise of the attack generally prevents enemies of the United Federation from implementing a coherent defense.\nEncyclopedia Militaria, 18th Edition, 2.016.826.\nThe computer whispered in her mind: Tell Artificial Intelligence Command we intercepted them?\n\"Do as I order. And confirm receipt of data.\"\nA moment later: Photos received by command.\n\"Good. Prepare for our assault.\"\nPreparing.\nWhile technically the planned military action was an \"assault,\" for all intents and purposes it was more akin to the proverbial shooting of fish in a barrel. Or even fish in a bucket - with grenades instead of guns.\nPresently Commander Werek comprised the only breathing component in the operation that included fifty automated battleships. As her instructor at the academy had put it, \"The AIs need a human in charge so they'll have someone to blame if the machines screw up.\" She and the other cadets hadn't laughed - they'd known there was truth to his statement.\nThe Phonusians on the surface had no time to react. After the initial crippling barrage aimed at defensive systems, the orbiting computers methodically hunted and killed from space, burning first colony halls and then homes, finally focusing on survivors scurrying from the wreckage like ants whose hill had been shoveled apart. A few sporadic final bursts finished the task.\nMission completed.\nWerek's organic mind had been incapable of following the numbing speed of the automated attack; all that registered was one massive flash, a war over, seemingly, nearly as soon as it had begun.\nThe commander swallowed hard. \"Total enemy kills?\"\nFour million, one hundred forty-three thousand, two hundred fifty-six.\nAn unbidden tear ran down Werek's cheek. \"Take the actors out of storage and prepare the lander.\"\nNearly an hour later, Werek waded ashore, wondering how machines capable of the pinpoint accuracy needed to slay over four million sentient creatures in just seconds could manage to miss setting down on the beach. Instead the lander had settled 40 meters offshore in nearly three feet of tepid ocean water.\n\"But this is perfect,\" the director reassured her, yelling over the noise of the surf. \"Couldn't have planned it better. My actors can wade ashore. Just like in the old newsreels - they'll love this back home. Let me set up and we can get started.\"\n\"No hurry,\" Werek said, staring at a charred exoskeleton bobbing in the waves. A child or a parent? She could not tell. She forced herself to recall the pictures of hostages being eaten alive, the monsters starting with a screaming victim's arm or leg. She remembered human faces twisted into gruesome death masks before being finally being consumed.\nAnd then, for a dizzy moment, she doubted; a wave of nausea passed through her. Were the pictures real? She felt disoriented. The logic should be - was - simple: The monsters slaughtered our innocent civilians, therefore we were justified in our surprise attack.\nYet her convictions seemed to modulate, from a peak of righteous indignation into a valley of doubt and through the cycle again. What's wrong with me? She raised her hand to her temple. Was it time to return to the center for - For what? A memory seemed to be hiding just outside of reach.\n\"I'm ready,\" the director called, breaking into her thoughts.\n\"Computer,\" Werek ordered in a tired voice as she finished wading onto the beach, outside of camera range. \"Cue the landing party.\"\nShe faced the armored cargo door at the rear of the lander as it hissed open. A squad in battle armor leaped into the water, splashing toward shore, fake rifles discharging smoke and empty cartridge casings. As the humans advanced, bipod battle machines followed, belching fire and launching dummy rockets. Within minutes the men and mechanicals had waded ashore, racing past the camera toward their imaginary foe.\n\"Cut,\" the director yelled.\nRobots and men came to a halt, the mechanicals waiting with the infinite patience of machines while the actors huddled around the director, anxious to see the replay on his portable studio.\nWerek joined them, watching the raw footage, aware that eventually computers would process the images, creating variations of the actors and machines to generate a massive invasion force. Animated enemy combatants would be added, and then everything would be assembled and mixed with stock footage, yielding a series of epic battle scenes.\nWhen the empire's loyal citizens saw the news stories, they'd believe they were witnessing thousands of human troops leaping from a hundred carriers. A few fighters would seemingly be cut down by enemy power beams; most would struggle to shore and engage the enemy. After such accounts had been fed to viewers for several days, the United Federation's victory would be announced. Then, according to the script, the Phonusians would commit mass suicide, leaving the planet open to another wave of human settlers.\nShould any pacifists raise objections, the photos of the slaughtered colonists could then be released. Those protestors who managed to keep their last meal down would be at the front of the patriotic parade after that, proclaiming that the Phonusians had got everything they deserved.\nPower to the sheeple.\nThe director spoke as the short clip they'd reviewed finished. \"Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen. We've got our footage. That's a wrap.\"\n\"Ready to leave?\" Werek asked.\nThe director nodded.\n\"Let's load up then.\"\nThe mechanicals immediately headed for the cargo bay where they would stow themselves. The actors followed leaving the commander and the director on the beach.\n\"Too bad we can't hang around,\" the director said, folding the portable studio and dropping it into his pocket. \"I think this is the most beautiful planet I've ever seen.\"\n\"There'll be others,\" Werek said. \"We've got three more on this tour.\"\nStory and illustrations Copyright \u00a9 by Duncan Long.

When I was a kid the show was a must-see. Each week after school I would watch adventures of the Enterprise crew and their encounters with Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans and more.\nI know I am not alone in this addiction. For one thing the TV producers would not keep making the shows if the audience did not exist.\nOver in the movie world, one of the most successful of all film series - Star Wars - was heavily populated with alien races. In 1979 Ridley Scott made one of the finest sf\/horror movies: Alien. The real star of this movie was the eponymous alien creature; the film spawned numerous sequels, books, comics and other products.\nThis fascination with aliens is not a recent phenomenon, nor has it been confined to the television and motion picture industries. From the early days of science fiction the concept of alien life has been a given. H.G. Wells wrote the first science fiction alien invasion classic, \"War of the Worlds\" in 1898, opening the floodgates for the efforts of later writers. This mantle was taken up by some of the greats of sf.\nArthur C. Clarke produced one of the great novels of the 20th Century in 1953 \u2013 Childhood's End \u2013 in which aliens arrive to take control of the Earth. John Wyndham's 1957 novel The Midwich Cuckoos centred upon a small English village taken over by aliens, imposing some difficult choices upon the Human Race. In 1972, Isaac Asimov, although not noted for writing about aliens in his fiction, wrote The Gods Themselves (1972), in which his alien race was split into three distinct sexes. The novel won him both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for best novel. This list could go on.\nBut science fiction writers cannot lay claim to being the first to dream of alien races on distant worlds. Most early societies believed there were other worlds, although these beliefs were usually religious or supernatural in nature: not so much aliens as demons and gods.\nThe ancient Greeks were the first to analyse the possibility of life on other worlds, in the 7th Century BC, but the idea was not the prevailing one. The Geocentric Universe (Earth-centred) notion favoured by Aristotle and Ptolemy won the day.\nThis notion remained the accepted \"truth\" of the nature of the universe for many centuries, spreading throughout Europe with the Christian Church's expansion. As the Earth-Centric Universe model precluded the existence of other worlds, it would be two thousand years before other worlds once more began to interest mankind, when two events occurred that would shape the entire science of astronomy.\nThe 16th Century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus published a revolutionary text called \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres). In this he detailed a sun-centred model for the Earth and other planets. Not long after Copernicus, the telescope was invented (credit for the invention is usually attributed to an unknown spectacle manufacturer from Holland).\nIt was the invention of the telescope that gave the idea of alien life a kick-start. Through the telescope new worlds previously unseen became visible, and some observers began to suspect that there might be systems like ours surrounding other stars. This was not a popular idea though: proposing the idea of other worlds saw some early astronomers condemned as heretics and burned at the stake.\nBelief in other worlds supporting life was common. Many leading astronomers and other scientists and thinkers supported the idea of alien life. French astronomer Bernard de Fontenelle wrote a book on the subject in 1686 called \"The Plurality of Worlds\" in which he expressed the view that all planets would be capable of sustaining life.\nWilliam Herschel (the first person since antiquity to discover a planet \u2013 Uranus in 1781) believed that the other planets of our solar system, as well as those orbiting other stars, would naturally by inhabited by alien species. \"Cosmic Pluralism\" was a well-supported idea \u2013 gaining followers such as politician Benjamin Franklin and philosopher John Locke.\nHerschel's son John, also an astronomer, was to become the victim of a hoax concerning alien life on the Moon in 1835. In August of that year the New York Sun published a series of articles detailing John Herschel's observations from his observatory in South Africa. They alleged that he had seen crystalline hills, active volcanoes, vast forests, a multitude of creatures including bison and unicorns, and the biggest claim of the article: two intelligent species. Herschel was claimed to have announced that he had seen a stone-age equivalent biped-beaver race, living in simple mud-huts and controlling fire, as well as a race of winged humanoids he called the Vespertilio-homo (\"man-bat\").\nThis deception would become known as The Great Moon Hoax, and when John Herschel was informed of his part in it, he apparantly took it in reasonable humour.\nBelief in extra-terrestrials was still widespread at the start of the modern age, and was famously demonstrated by Orson Welles' radio dramatisation of \"War of the Worlds\". When it first aired on US radio, mass panic erupted across America. Welles had chosen to dramatise this story in the form of news bulletins announcing the invasion, beginning with the landing of a \"huge flaming object\" on a farm at Grovers Mill, New Jersey and the destruction of large areas of the United States. As the play progressed, fake bulletins interrupted dance hall tunes giving the latest details of the invasion. It was very well done \u2013 too well, you might say \u2013 because anyone who had not tuned in at the start of the play would have missed the announcement that what followed was fiction and so could be convinced by the realism.\nBut it wasn't just the general public that held onto the belief in life on Mars. In the 19th Century an Italian Astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, had drawn maps of the surface of Mars. He drew the surface of Mars containing a network of long straight lines he called \"canali\".\nThe Italian word for \"canale\" means canal, a word that, in English, refers to an artificial construct. Many astronomers, chief amongst them American Percival Lowell, believed these to be irrigation canals, fashioned by Martians to water their crops.\nThis belief was partly due to translation, and partly due to current events. The Italian word \"canale\" does mean canal, but it can also means \"channel\" or \"gully\" \u2013 both natural watercourses. This dual meaning lead to a misunderstanding of Schiaparelli's intent. Also, these observations were being made against the backdrop of major canal building on Earth \u2013 the Suez Canal had been completed in 1869 and a first attempt at building the Panama Canal had started in 1880. So astronomers were interpreting their observations in line with their terrestrial experience.\nAlthough this romantic notion of a Martian civilisation had appeal, it did not gain universal support. For one thing, not every person who trained their telescope on Mars saw the supposed canals. E. E. Barnard, discoverer in 1916 of Barnard's Star and recognised as one of the finest observers of his day, saw no such lines. And early in the 20th Century demonstrations were carried out to show that the lines could have been the result of optical illusions, caused by the observations having been made at the very limit of the power of the telescopes being used.\nBut when the Space Age began there was still a belief in the scientific community that life could be found. Mercury and the moon were quickly shown to be lifeless, but hopes were high for both Mars and Venus when the first space probes were sent.\nThroughout the 20th Century there were several theories about what might be discovered when mankind reached Venus. One theory of Venus viewed it as a very Earth-like world, but somewhat behind us in terms of development \u2013 similar to the Earth of the Carboniferous Period. Swedish astronomer Svante Arrhenius had been a supporter of this model, but it was quickly shown to not fit the known facts and was discarded by 1940.\nAnother theory saw Venus as very Earth-like with a rich oxygen atmosphere between the carbon dioxide clouds (which had been detected in the atmosphere of the planet by analysing the spectrum of reflected light). This was also quickly shown to be incorrect \u2013 carbon dioxode is denser than oxygen and so would have sunk to the bottom of the atmosphere, rather than remaining in the high altitudes. Another popular theory had Venus as a watery world, with little dry land \u2013 its Oceans teeming with life. And the final serious idea was that Venus was a dry, fiercely hot, lifeless rock.\nNo one, however, had predicted the true conditions that were found when the first of the space probes arrived.\nSince the dawn of the Space Age, numerous probes have been sent to Venus and Mars and both planets have proved disappointing in the search for life \u2013 although very interesting to scientists in many other ways.\nMars has a very thin atmosphere, no surface water and a highly cratered surface. The dreams of a Martian civilisation ended when the Mariner and Viking missions returned their results. But this is not the end of the chances for life existing on Mars. There could be water trapped under the surface of the Red Planet, and microscopic life may well exist underground, although no incontrovertible evidence for this has yet been found.\nVenus is the very embodiment of hell. It is hot: at the surface the temperature exceeds 400\u00b0C. The atmosphere is also very dense, ninety times greater than Earth's, and the whole planet is covered in clouds of sulphuric acid.\nBut these are not the only worlds believed to be capable of supporting life in our solar system. The outer planets themselves, being gas giants, would not be viable home for the kind of life we would recognise, but these planets have moons that are comparable in size to the terrestrial planets. So scientists have turned their gaze towards these worlds.\nTwo candidates stand out.\nEuropa, the fourth largest moon of Jupiter, is an ice-covered world. Due to the gravitational forces exerted upon it by Jupiter and the other Jovian moons, it is believed that under the ice is a vast ocean. The presence of liquid water would support the possibility of life on Europa, and it has been suggested that it might be of a similar type to that seen in Earth's oceans surrounding deep-ocean hydrothermal vents.\nNASA currently has plans to send a robotic drilling probe to Europa in an attempt to confirm the existence of such an ocean and to analyse its composition.\nSaturn's largest moon, Titan, is another possible contender for life. It has the only other nitrogen-rich atmosphere that we know of, consisting of 98.4% Nitrogen, with the remainder being mainly methane with trace amounts of other gases including hydrocarbons. This mix is thought to be similar to that of the early Earth. Since Titan is much further out from the Sun and considerably colder than Earth, it is unlikely that there would have been sufficient energy to cause the necessary chemical reactions for life to begin.\nThen there are worlds outside our solar system. We know of the existence of over two hundred Extrasolar Planets, so the formation of solar systems looks common. But what can we do to determine whether there is life out there?\nThe only chance we would have at our current level of development would be the detection of other civilisations. If there are worlds out there supporting early stages of life, then we have no way of knowing. There would be only two ways we could determine whether another star shines down on a life-bearing planet.\nThe first of these is the staple of science fiction: the alien race that comes calling; the old \"We come in peace\" line \u2013 or at least we hope it would be peace. The second, and more realistic, is by detecting their transmissions.\nSince the 1930s the Earth has been a beacon in space. We have been broadcasting radio and TV programmes, plus other forms of communication into space. If races on other planets have developed civilisation then it is likely that they too would have begun broadcasting. So we need to train our radio telescopes on the sky and search for signals.\nThe first attempts at discovering life by such means occurred in the 1920s. In 1922 and 1924 all radio stations in the USA were silent for a period, so that their signals would not interfere with any originating from Mars. None were detected.\nIt was 1960 before the search started in earnest: astronomer Frank Drake, based at Cornell University in the USA, used a 25 metre radio telescope to examine the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. So far, in four and a half decades of searching, we have no proof of alien life. The only signal we have ever apparently received from the skies was detected on August 15th 1977. On that day Jerry Ehman, a volunteer on the SETI project at Ohio State University, observed a very strong signal. His reaction was to draw a circle around the trace and write \"Wow!\" in the margin. Because of his actions, this has since been known as The \"Wow!\" Signal.\nAlthough this is the leading candidate for proving the existing of extra-terrestrial life it has never been detected again, even when examining that same region of space. And so, as far as we know, we are still alone. But given the number of stars out there, this surely isn't true!\nNext Month:\nI. E. Lester continues his exploration of alien life, looking at the possible forms \"life\" might take on other worlds, and asking the question: does life on other planets have to be anything like life on Earth?\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by I.

The little monkey poked his red face out of a canopy of vines, peeked around warily, and when it seemed to think its surroundings were safe, made its move, bounding out across a clearing. Creeping down from his perch in a McDonald's Tallow Tree\u2122, Quinn paused briefly to adjust the Sony Ferncam\u2122 hidden in the wood so it would capture the full scene. When he reached the forest floor, he readied his tranquilizer gun, took careful aim, and fired. The Reese's Peanut Butter Monkey\u2122, who was in mid-jump when the dart connected, fell like a stone to the ground below, rolled, took a few staggering steps, then finally collapsed again and stopped moving. Quinn made his way over exposed tree roots and around dangling vines to approach the unmoving monkey. Its blond-haired chest moved in and out.\nAnd, of course, they got advertising rights.\nQuinn laid the monkey on its side and removed a stencil from his pack, which he spread over the sleeping creature. He then used an airbrush kit to carefully apply the Reese's\u2122 corporate logo and trademark orange and brown colors to the monkey's coat. Turning the monkey over, he repeated the procedure on its other side. When he was finished, he stenciled on the monkey's stomach, \"Hello, my name is...\" Quinn paused. Naming was always the hard part for him, and he often chose behavioral traits exhibited by the animal to inform its name. He thought for a moment. The monkey was clearly male, and a little tentative in its movements, as it had peeked out into the clearing with some trepidation. Trepidation Quinn could understand; in this day and age it was a necessary survival instinct for every species. He smiled, and stenciled the name \"PEEKY.\"\nAfter taking a blood sample from Peeky for a lab test back home, Quinn administered a few shots. Then he patted the monkey on the head.\nHe pulled a few Reese's Peanut Butter Cups\u2122 out of his bag, and one Hershey\u2122 milk chocolate bar with almonds. Then he went to work, chowing on one of the Reese's\u2122.\nQuinn wished that he worked for Hershey\u2122, as they had been advertising through the E.S.S.A. for several years, and were one of the big guns that constantly fought to get more animals onto the Endangered Species List \u2013 even when those animals were not even remotely endangered \u2013 and, therefore, had been sponsoring millions of domestic American cows, all sporting big Hershey's Milk Chocolate\u2122 stencils. That aside, Quinn preferred milk chocolate with almonds to peanut butter and chocolate, and companies always gave freebies. But a job was a job, and he seemed to need more and more money to survive in an ever-quickening society. Didn't everyone? He ate another peanut butter cup. At least he wasn't the guy who had to tag all the Tallow Trees\u2122 for McDonald's\u2122; Quinn truly felt sorry for that poor schmuck.\nAs he rearranged supplies in his pack for the long hike back to the main road where his Lincoln Navigator\u2122 was parked, Quinn heard rustling in the jungle surrounding him. He glanced around, noted that Peeky was still conked out in the clearing \u2013 and certainly would be for at least another fifteen minutes \u2013 then dropped the candy bars. He crouched down and dug into his pack. He wasn't armed, other than with the tranquilizer gun, so he pulled that out, readied a dart, and waited. He had seen more than a few endangered Ford Jaguars\u2122 and Colt Pythons\u2122 during this hunt, and those were only the sponsored animals, those moved to China for protection. And those were the ones he knew about; who could tell what other nasty creatures roamed this jungle, looking for their next meal.\nThen there was more rustling, and when the foliage parted and a figure ran into the clearing, Quinn fired a dart into its midsection, realizing, a second later, that he had just tranquilized a skinny long-haired white dude in a loincloth and a New York Yankees\u2122 baseball cap. The white dude stopped, picked the dart out of his chest, looked at it quizzically, and said, \"Hey, man, you shot me,\" then fell to the ground. A second later, a black woman with short dreadlocks and dressed like an intrepid British explorer walked from the jungle, saw the fallen white dude and Quinn, assessed the situation, and ran toward Quinn, screaming the whole way.\n\"Whoa, whoa,\" said Quinn, backing up. He got to his feet and tried to get another dart into the chamber, but fumbled with the mechanism. Luckily for him, the woman tripped and fell, whacking her head on the ground. She immediately tried to stand up, held her head, and fell again. It appeared she was out cold.\nQuinn put the tranquilizer gun down, and, for a moment, just stared at the two people and one Reese's Peanut Butter Monkey\u2122 lying on the ground in front of him. This job just kept getting weirder.\nHe scanned their wounds. A knot on the woman's forehead said she would have one hell of a headache when she woke, and the man would be groggy for a while from the tranq, but they were all still breathing.\n\"This has got to be a joke,\" he said aloud.\nThen he got busy tying the man and woman to a McDonald's Tallow Tree\u2122.\nThe white dude woke, groggily tried to stand, then sat down hard. \"What'd you shoot me for?\" he said.\nQuinn shrugged. \"Look at you. You're half-naked and covered with mud. With you running out of the jungle, how was I supposed to know you weren't some sort of wild animal?\"\n\"I'm not.\"\n\"What's your name?\" Quinn said.\n\"Uh, Ringo,\" said the dude. Before Quinn could speak, Ringo continued, \"Yeah, I know, so Mom was a big Beatles fan. Look, um...can I go now?\"\nQuinn ignored the question. \"Who's your friend?\"\n\"That's Jessika. She's a babe, huh? Don't get any ideas, 'cause, y'know, she's mine.\"\n\"Right,\" Quinn said. \"OK, so who the fuck are you people and where do you come from?\"\n\"Uh, well, I'm from Minneapolis, and Jess, she's from Portland, I think. The one in Oregon. Where are you from \u2013 \"\nJessika opened her eyes. \"We're People Who Hate Animal Advertising and Exploitation, Seattle branch,\" she said. She moved, then winced, putting her hand to her forehead. \"That's P.W.H.A.A.E. We think what you're doing is wrong. And, Ringo, you pasty-faced weasel, I'm not yours.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Ringo said.\n\"Come off it,\" Quinn said. \"Tagging doesn't hurt the animals. It helps them. Companies feed and take care of them, and they \u2013 \"\n\"We've heard this shit before,\" Jessika said.\n\"Yeah, we've heard this shit before,\" Ringo said.\n\"That's right. Same old story.\"\n\"Look,\" Quinn said, and pointed to Peeky, who was lying flat and seemingly lifeless on the ground. \"Does it look like there's anything wrong with him?\"\n\"You mean other than that he's not moving?\" Jessika said. \"At all?\"\n\"He's fine,\" Quinn said, and got up, then went to Peeky and shook him. The little monkey, tagged almost from head to tail in orange and brown, shook his head and got slowly to his feet.\n\"No, no,\" Jessika said. \"Nothing wrong with him.\"\nQuinn scratched Peeky under the chin, and the monkey looked up at him, shook his head again and sneezed. Then he lay back down and went to sleep.\n\"Dude,\" Ringo said, \"how about all that paint and shit on him? It would suck to go around with ads all over your body. Quinn pointed at the big N.Y. logo on Ringo's hat, and Ringo took it off, looked at it, then shrugged and put it back on. \"OK, so what, but it's my choice to wear this, right?\"\n\"As long as all of them have the logos,\" Quinn said, \"then I'm sure none of them care.\"\n\"Sounds like an argument for school uniforms,\" Ringo said.\n\"So,\" Jessika said, \"what you're saying is that if, say, Microsoft\u2122 made everyone in Seattle look the same and dress the same, and covered them with Microsoft\u2122 logos, nothing would be different and no one would care?\"\n\"You think anyone would care?\"\n\"Hell yes,\" she said.\n\"How about if Microsoft\u2122 also gave everyone food, shelter, high-speed web access and a new Mercedes\u2122?\"\nJessika opened her mouth to say something, but Ringo cut her off.\n\"Who's giving away a new Mercedes\u2122? Sign me up, yo.\"\n\"See?\" Quinn said.\n\"Look,\" Jessika said. \"We just think it's wrong to do this to the animals when they don't even have a choice. Besides, you do it only to get something out of it.\"\n\"Me?\" Quinn said.\n\"You. And everyone else like you.\"\n\"And you were going to do what about it?\"\n\"Stop you,\" Jessika said. \"Remove the logos, whatever we have to do.\"\n\"How many of you are there?\" Quinn asked.\n\"How many of who?\"\n\"People Who Hate Animal Advertising and Exploitation,\" Quinn said. Then he added, trying not to laugh, \"Pwhaae.\"\n\"Oh,\" she said. She looked to Ringo, who shrugged. \"Well, for now...two.\"\n\"You two.\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"I see.\"\nQuinn nodded, watched them for a few moments, then said, \"If I untie you and let you go, are you going to try to stop me? Or are you going to go home and leave me alone?\"\n\"What choice do we have?\" Ringo said.\n\"I can't promise anything,\" Jessika said.\n\"Great,\" Quinn said, and untied both of them. \"As much as I'd like to leave you tied up, I can't be responsible for you getting eaten by a Jaguar\u2122, because I do get tagging work from Ford\u2122 from time to time, and they don't deal well with bad publicity.\"\n\"Ford owns Jag?\" Ringo said. \"See? I mean, that's fucked up.\"\n\"Glad you know what's important,\" Quinn said. He shook his head. What was any of this going to prove?\nRingo stood, stretched, and then waited for Jessika to do the same. Quinn tossed them both a Reese's\u2122, then turned to give one to Peeky.\nNo Peeky.\n\"Guess your little friend bailed,\" Ringo said through a mouthful of chocolate and peanut butter.\nQuinn looked around the entire clearing and saw that, indeed, Peeky was gone. Which sucked, because he had developed an affinity for the little guy, orange and brown fur and all. He opened the Reese's\u2122 package and set the peanut butter cups down on the ground. Maybe Peeky would come back to get them.\nQuinn heard a rushing sound and turned just in time to see Ringo swinging his own backpack full of tagging supplies at his head. He threw up his arms to block, but the pack whacked him in the forehead, and he saw stars. He dropped to his knees and saw Jessika approaching with ropes.\nAs Jessika tied Quinn to the same tree he had tied her to earlier, she said, \"Maybe your monkey ran off to hotwire and jack your S.U.V. Ever think of that possibility? Teaching all the inhabitants of Earth to take handouts, to beg for help. I mean, why shouldn't a cute little monkey get his share? Maybe he's becoming human.\"\nOr maybe, Quinn thought, the monkey had no interest in S.U.V.s, peanut butter, chocolate, advertising, people, or anything outside of its daily life, here in the lush forest valley. No thoughts but the day-to-day of real life, right in front of him, with all its faults. Being tied to a tree, Quinn wondered if it would ever be possible for him to live that way. But he could never say anything like that to these two. And definitely not now. How had he allowed this situation to come about?\n\"You're not going to just leave me here,\" Quinn said. He struggled against the ropes, but they held fast.\n\"Yeah, dude,\" Ringo said. \"We are. Thanks for the chocolate, OK?\"\n\"There are cameras. All over the place. You've already been seen.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Ringo said. \"Right, there were cameras. Sorry, Sony\u2122 can bill me or whatever.\"\nGreat, Quinn thought. So he was stuck here. Until he could get loose. And then get back in his S.U.V. and drive to the airport. To go back home.\n\"How am I going to get home? This is China,\" Quinn said. \"We're not in Seattle, or Minneapolis. This is the wilderness.\"\nRingo looked at him, seemingly confused. \"There's not much wilderness left, dude. Someone's got to do something about that, too, don't you think?\"\n\"You?\" Quinn said. Then he laughed, hard at first, but he let it trail off.\n\"Someone,\" Ringo said. \"Maybe there are lots of us. You'd be amazed what people can accomplish when they believe in things strongly enough, you know? Even without corporate sponsorship. Sorry, dude, but we have to do this.\"\nRingo unfolded a stencil from his pocket and held it up in front of Quinn. It was covered with logos, symbols, product names and numbers. Dozens of them. Ringo pressed it close to Quinn's body. Then Jessika walked up, shaking a can of fluorescent hunter orange spray paint.\n\"Where did you get that stuff?\" Quinn said. \"You didn't have that with you. Do you have some sort of base out here? Who's paying you to \u2013 \"\n\"Hey,\" Jessika said, cutting him off. \"It's never too late to change your worldview.\" She unbuttoned Quinn's shirt, put her palm flat against his chest. \"Never. You are who you choose to be. If you've got a heart. Feels like you do. There are always people who'll help you if you want to change the way things are. Just remember that. OK?\"\nQuinn nodded, unnerved by the way she seemed to know what he was thinking. But, then again, maybe that's what everyone was thinking. Or maybe people were just really easy to read nowadays. And who was to blame for that?\nQuinn stood nearly naked, but for his pants. Jessika and Ringo began to tag him.\nA few minutes later, through the haze of paint particles floating in the jungle air, the two disappeared back the way they had come, leaving Quinn alone, tied to his thoughts and a body of proof that he was no more than a tool for enforcing other people's ways of life on the rest of the world, and all for their own personal gain. The paint itched on his skin. He had never realized how uncomfortable it all should have made him.\nIf the monkeys had a choice, would they still go for corporate sponsorship? Would they want the handout, strings and all? Or would they find another way? Steal or even die first? Quinn, looked at his body, covered with bright orange logos, and thought the answer to that question was paramount. Humiliation and outrage, pent up frustration and stress pounded in his head. Then he began to cry.\nAll at once, the paint fumes rising off his body made Quinn's head swim. His vision faded until the jungle swirled around him into darkness.\nWhen Quinn woke, it was dark. He looked around, saw that his gear was still there. He made a mental checklist of all his things: the pack, his tagging equipment, even the tranq gun. Everything, in fact, except the Hershey\u2122 bar. He strained at his bindings only to find that he had none. Someone had untied him. He stood, shakily, and walked around, checking, but the Hershey\u2122 bar was nowhere to be found. For some reason, that Hershey\u2122 bar became the thing Quinn wanted the most, his tie to some semblance of normalcy. But, no, it was gone now. Normalcy was gone now. Ringo had probably nabbed it. But then he smiled. Maybe not Ringo. If he ever saw the little monkey again, maybe he would rename Peeky to Sneaky.\nQuinn packed up his gear and then, exhausted from just that much exertion, slumped down next to the McDonald's Tallow Tree\u2122 and closed his eyes. Why him? Of all the taggers that P.W.H.A.A.E. could harass, why him? But then, if it had happened to someone else and not to him, would he ever have questioned the way he felt about tagging? About anything? The thought was branded in his mind.\nThings were rushing around in his head. Money, possessions, work, questions, decisions, insecurities. Could he live without all of that? Was it possible?\nIf you believed in it strongly enough, maybe.\nHis satellite phone rang. That sound, here in the jungle, seemed so out of place. Everything seemed somehow different now. All of a sudden. He looked at his phone. The caller I.D. said it was his manager, Bob Golly, the man who got him his tagging gigs. Quinn took a deep breath, then answered the phone.\n\"Quinn here.\"\n\"Quinn, got an excellent job in the works,\" Bob said. His voice, already high and squeaky, was amplified and distorted by the phone transmission. \"How would you like to go to... Australia?\"\n\"Not Koala Bears. Qantas Airlines\u2122 has Koalas.\"\n\"Nah. Kangaroos, Quinn. Boeing\u2122 is going to sponsor kangaroos. Isn't that great?\"\n\"Boeing\u2122?\" Quinn said. \"The, uh, jet manufacturer?\"\n\"Right, but they like the kangaroos, cause when they jump they sort of go boing, boing, boing. Get it?\"\n\"I get it,\" Quinn said. The world, he thought, was moving ever-further from reality, and at an ever-quickening pace. And no one ever saw how silly they looked from the outside. He looked down at his arms, covered in little car logos, his chest, covered in soda logos. How silly he would look to anyone anywhere.\n\"So what do you think?\" Bob said.\nQuinn felt something tugging at his arm and opened his eyes. Peeky sat nearby, no longer badged with a corporate logo, once again just a plain old blond rhesus monkey. Ringo and Jessika had obviously lied to him, one way or the other. Either they had gone out and removed all the logos from all the monkeys after they left him, or there were more than just the two of them, and the rest of P.W.H.A.A.E. had done the job. Maybe there are lots of us.\n\"Quinn, you there?\" Bob said.\nPeeky lifted a piece of rope in his hand, and Quinn wondered if the monkey had untied him. Anything was possible. Then the monkey dropped the rope and lifted its other hand toward Quinn, who opened his own hand to take the offered item. Peeky deposited a candy bar in Quinn's hand. Quinn looked at the candy bar, at first unbelieving, and then he smiled. The wrapper read Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds\u2122.\n\"Thanks,\" Quinn said. \"This is exactly what I needed.\"\n\"Great,\" Bob said. \"There'll be tickets waiting for you at the airport.\"\nQuinn opened the Hershey\u2122 bar, broke it in half, and gave one half to Peeky, who began to nibble on it immediately.\n\"Companies,\" Quinn said into the phone, \"have the same responsibility as individuals do, if not more. They should support causes that matter to them, not just causes that will give them something back, a return on their investment. You help others because you care, not because you want something in exchange for what you give.\"\n\"What?\" Bob said. \"What are you going on about? That's not how the world works.\"\n\"I know.\"\nQuinn looked at the other half of the candy bar in his hand, then he gave that to Peeky as well.\n\"Look, it's what you do,\" Bob said. \"That's what work is, what everything in society is about.\"\n\"Society is about taking care of each other.\"\n\"Quinn, what are you talking about?\"\n\"It's my choice. It's everyone's choice,\" Quinn said.\nThen he dug the keys to his S.U.V. out of his pack and tossed them to Peeky.\nPeeky, mouth rimmed with chocolate, grinned widely, stood and jumped up and down a few times, and, with a rattle of keys and one ear-curdlingly loud screech, ran off.\nEveryone's choice, Quinn thought. Ford\u2122 and Colt\u2122, Hershey\u2122 and Reese's\u2122, Microsoft\u2122 and Boeing\u2122, Jaguar\u2122, Disney\u2122, Nike\u2122, DuPont\u2122, even the good ol' U.S. of A.\n\"Quinn?\" Bob said. \"Are you there? Timmons?\"\nQuinn watched the little blond monkey bound away. Then he dropped his cell phone, put down his pack full of advertising accoutrements, candy bars, and tranquilizing devices, removed his pants, exposing the only part of him not yet branded, and followed Peeky into the jungle.\nThe voice of the Civilized World\u2122 faded from his hearing almost immediately.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Ken Brady.

(Yes, it's the fourth part of the trilogy . . . )\nBy Ian Shircore\nRead Part 1 | Read Part 2 | Read Part 3\nIn keeping with the best traditions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Darker Matter is proud to present, this month, the fourth part of our three-part interview with the great Douglas Adams, based on long-lost cassette tapes recorded on a summer's day in 1979.\nThe story so far is that Douglas has written the first radio series of Hitchhiker's and seen it broadcast twice without making the impact that might have been expected. Pan Books are keen to get the paperback version into the shops and there is a definite groundswell of excitement beginning to build up around the show and its author. Yet the man at the centre of all this is still having to hold down a day job as a temporary script editor for Dr Who, just to keep body and soul together. He's working at the BBC all day and sweating over the first Hitchhiker's book and the second radio series far into the night. And when freelance journalist Ian Shircore mentions his conviction that Adams is on his way to being a household name, the interview wobbles and nearly skids to a halt.\nWith hindsight, it's hard to see what Douglas was worrying about. Within months he was a best-selling author and trendy vicars everywhere were misquoting his jokes to spice up their sermons. Within a few more years, he had achieved worldwide fame, become known as a passionate advocate of atheism and Apple computers and assembled what he claimed was the world's biggest collection of lefthanded guitars. He never found writing easy, but he never again got himself into the situation he was in in 1979, where the almost unbearable pressure he was under resulted, paradoxically, in the production of some of his finest work.\nFrom an early age, Douglas Adams had a fine ear for humorous dialogue \u2013 and a genuinely comic ability to grasp the wrong end of the stick. Curled up under the bedclothes, he listened with glee to the punning, surreal, outrageous lunacy of Kenneth Horne, Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick and Bill Pertwee in the BBC Light Programme series Beyond Our Ken. He was distraught when the show ended in 1965, and totally failed to understand when it was brought back just two months later in a similar format and with much the same line-up, under a slightly different title.\n'I used to love Beyond Our Ken,' he confided. 'Then it came back as Round the Horne and, for some reason, I thought \"The title's different, so it's not the same show.\" So I didn't listen to it.'\nIt wasn't the only time Douglas jumped to a wrong conclusion or saw things in himself that would eventually inspire his comic muse. As he grew up, he learned to live with the fact that he could be spectacularly clumsy, impossibly unworldly and, at times, irredeemably gloomy. But it's part of the skill of a comic genius to fashion this kind of raw material into the stuff of great art.\nDouglas Adams frequently told the world about the source of one of his best-loved creations, Marvin, the hyper-intelligent, hyper-miseryguts robot ('What are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?' 'You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? Gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level'). Marvin was supposedly based on a former scriptwriting colleague of his called Andrew Marshall, who later won fame and fortune with his 1990s TV series 2 Point 4 Children. Having blighted Marshall's early career with this unfortunate slur, Adams admitted that another strand in Marvin's saturnine persona had its origins rather closer to home.\n'I get into terribly depressed states, and a lot of Marvin's actual lines come from occasions like that,' Adams revealed. 'There's a certain amount of me in there.'\nIn fact, according to Douglas, he had been 'fairly neurotic' as a child and was still 'incredibly shy and self-conscious' as an adult. But this was one of the many aspects of his life that was beginning to change as people became aware of The Hitchhiker's Guide and the talent that created it.\n'I've suddenly realised, very recently, that it's actually comfortable to go to something public, like a party, and know that some part of you has gone on ahead, so that people know something about you.\n'It is difficult to come to terms with seeing yourself in a different and more public light. I felt very lost for a time, and it took a while to settle down and get my bearings again. I'm not even sure I can say that I've found them yet. But at least I've now got used to the process that's going on.'\nThe progress from this self-effacing introspection to the confident, witty and relaxed star of a host of later TV interviews and conference appearances obviously had a lot to do with Douglas's dawning realisation that people were genuinely grateful to him for the laughter and ideas he gave them. Any majority is made up of smaller minorities, and Douglas was inevitably pigeonholed, at first, with the science fiction writers of his generation, on the one hand, and the post-Python school of British humorists on the other. But once the Hitchhiker's snowball started rolling, it was quickly clear that he was appealing to more than just the SF community or the committed Monty Python fans. His delight at seeing his work transcend all categories until it existed as a unique phenomenon in its own right, with huge international audiences of every age and background, must have gone a long way towards eliminating any niggling self-doubt.\nNot having to fret about where the next chunk of income was coming from will have helped, too, especially after the ups and downs of his early career. By the time of this interview, he had already tasted enough modest financial success to know that he would need a lot more.\n'I find the difference, for me, between having no money and having quite a bit is that the bills get bigger. And that's it. The lifestyle doesn't change.\n'The reason I hope I'll make a lot of money is that I'm actually so hopeless about it. I just don't understand the nature of the beast, so I'm very bad at holding on to it.'\nDouglas had managed to spend almost six months writing the six episodes of the first Hitchhiker's radio series 'for an initial fee of about \u00a31,000'. Even though he'd squeezed in four Dr Who scripts as well, he'd still been left working in an office for the BBC and hiding from his bank manager. Now the numbers were starting to get bigger, with a much better fee for the second radio series and the prospect of 'about 9 or 10 grand' for the six-part TV show, and Douglas was starting to think about the real business prospects for his creation.\nThe TV series, he explained, should trigger much better sales of the book and the LP record. And then, he added, 'It's all a question of sales abroad.' Douglas Adams may not have been good at keeping hold of money, but he was quite well aware of how it was made.\nHe had, for example, already calculated that the big bucks from US television would not come from the BBC selling its programmes to the American public broadcasting network. They could, however, arrive in the form of a format sale, in which a US company would buy the rights to remake the series with a transatlantic flavour. The inspiration for this line of thinking was the fortune made by the writers of the limp Seventies sitcom Man About the House, which became Three's Company in the US and ran for several years, making a lot of people very rich.\nDouglas was not squeamish about the moral dangers of sudden wealth, and he was certainly prepared to explore this kind of future for The Hitchhiker's Guide.\n'There's a bloke who's interested in buying the rights to make the show in America. I've been told the guys who wrote Man About the House sold the format rights to American TV and made $700,000 each, over a period of two years. But it's all pie in the sky. Let's see what actually comes in.'\nThough he obviously chafed at the need to stay a little longer on the Dr Who staff, Douglas used the experience to sharpen his awareness of the vital differences between radio and television. He had already seen his own Dr Who scripts go through the mill of the TV production process, and had not much liked some of the final output.\n'When you're writing something, you have to believe this is the way it should be.\n'But you know it's going to go through hundreds of people before it gets to the screen and it'll end up looking totally unlike anything you envisaged. So you also have to learn to divorce yourself from everything you put into it and judge the final product not according to your original intentions but according to whether the thing you see is good. And that's hard to do.\n'When you've seen something that's not at all what you envisaged, it's more difficult to go back next time and put yourself in the frame of mind of a writer. So you have to learn to take what satisfaction you can from getting it right the first time.'\nThis big team, almost corporate, approach contrasted vividly with the 'rock sessions' ethos in which the original radio series had been created. Though he was ready to take on the challenges of putting Hitchhiker's on television, there was no doubt which way of working suited Douglas's soul. Though recording necessarily involves actors' interpretations and technical processes, the radio shows had still ended up 'fairly close' to the author's original vision.\n'I was there the whole time, which is fairly unusual. There were very few things I would have objected to \u2013 just the odd turn of phrase or the odd sound-effect.\n'We'd be down in that dark underground studio for hours and hours every day, just achieving a very small amount of tape \u2013 knowing what we were doing was different, but losing all sense of whether it was good or not. Because when you're that close for so long, you have no yardstick to measure it against.'\nWorking on the bigger, more complex canvas of television appealed to a different part of Douglas's brain. It drew on his professionalism, his problem-solving skills and his delight in the exercise of artful technique. Script editing Dr Who had given him plenty of opportunity to see the characteristic faults of novice television writers \u2013 and to thank his stars he'd been able to make his early mistakes in the more forgiving medium of radio.\n'Hundreds of people who've never written before send in Dr Who scripts. They may have good ideas, but what they fail to realise is that writing for TV is incredibly complicated. They have no idea how difficult it is and what the financial commitment is.\n'On the whole, we have to take on people who know a bit about it. After all, if someone wanted to be a surgeon, you'd want to know they could take out a neat pair of tonsils before you let them loose on a heart transplant. From that point of view, radio is the place to start.'\nIn practice, the original Hitchhiker's radio series was cobbled together in a much more haphazard way than now meets the eye \u2013 and with an arbitrary pragmatism that would have given the TV people the screaming abdabs. For example, the story of the researcher who found a planet inhabited by all the galaxy's lost biros (where they were able to enjoy 'a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli') is one of the great solo riffs of Episode 3, one of Douglas's two favourite episodes. Yet it was apparently moved there for the overwhelmingly compelling artistic reason that Ep 3 was 'a bit short' and its original home was in a show that was running long.\nLuckily the storylines in Hitchhiker's are what one later critic referred to politely as 'blithely episodic'. Whether this was originally a matter of cause or effect is hardly important any more. But despite both being tagged with the SF label, this is one key area in which Dr Who and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy could not have been more different.\nAfter many hours of raking through these old interview tapes, I think perhaps it's right to end with Douglas's own description of the strange, looping, frustrating writing process that eventually gave birth to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy \u2013 one of the oddest and best-loved creations of the late 20th century. The way he tells it, it's a wonder Hitchhiker's ever saw the light of day. And it's certainly a huge sadness that we will never hear that unique voice again, explaining the inexplicable or turning our assumptions inside out in the name of comedy and new perspectives.\n'When you're writing Dr Who, which is conceived purely in dramatic terms, you can plot it thoroughly in advance and know exactly what you're doing and what scenes are going to go where. With Hitchhiker's, you can't do that, because you can't calculate in advance what's going to be funny.\nEvery time you do plot a way ahead, you come to write the next scene and you realise it's not going to work as comedy, because it's not funny. Then you have to put in an extra element or shove it round this way and that, which means that the plot you just worked out goes out of the window and you have to re-plot it again. Then the same thing happens again. So you just do it scene by scene and hope you're going to get somewhere \u2013 and that makes it very difficult to write.\n'I tend to write myself into corners. I'm in a terrible corner at the moment. I've ground to a halt while I try to work out how to get it back on the right lines. But that's the continual story of writing this show.'\nInterview Copyright \u00a9 1979, 2007 by Ian Shircore.

Out of the one hundred and twenty men, women, clones and children assigned to the rock, the only one to survive the carnage was a Geologist Second Class named Kennie O'Tulley, and we knew that without some cutting edge doctoring he wouldn't be with us much longer either. A short burst from one of the Dripper's strange weapons was slowly melting him away molecule by molecule. From below the waist he was already completely gone. He could feel every atom break off and float away.\nBut I couldn't. I had my orders. If I disobeyed, it would be my head on the stick. I bagged him with minutes to spare.\nEarth needed brains. Brains could still fight. It was as simple as that.\nThey let me stay with him the entire trip back to civilization. When we reached base, I tracked down the main cutter and pulled him off to the side where we could talk in private. I ax-ed him if there was anything he could do to help out my buddy. I told him he would have my eternal gratitude.\nThere was only one thing he could do. It was a new, experimental technique for which my friend would be a perfect test subject. This far from the core a cutter didn't get many opportunities to frankenstein. A successful procedure that helped the war effort could get an ambitious man shipped farther from the front lines.\nHe had no interest in my eternal gratitude. He did have interest in the two pounds of planetside dirt I had been carefully hoarding for eleven months.\nFor some reason I agreed without bothering to haggle. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. I gave up everything I worked and killed and bled for to help a man I had known for mere minutes.\nHe then explained what I would get for my soil.\nHe would have to put O'Tulley's head on a stick. That was the law. But he might also be able to save one of the geologist's arms.\n\"Just one?\" I asked.\n\"Just one,\" he confirmed. \"Right or left. You pick.\"\n\"But what good is it to be a head on a stick with one arm?\" I ax-ed.\n\"It beats being just a head on a stick,\" he countered.\nI wasn't certain I agreed with him, but I could see that he had a position. Perhaps Geologist Second Class Kennie O'Tulley would agree with him.\nI picked the left. The cutter nodded and got to work.\nFour months later I heard what happened. By then I had troubles of my own, but closure was nice.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Charles Richard Laing.

Even in the warm haze of first-level Mesh, she could feel it. Even in Gemin Zeo's arms, she couldn't ignore it. A wound-tight excitement, the sense of standing on tiptoe at the edge of an abyss to catch a glance of a thing birthing below, an energy like the crackle of lightning-sculptures in a close-up insulating suit. Something reaching for Accord.\n\"Tell me,\" Gemin said, raising eyes to indicate their bizarre surrounds. \"You do not enjoy our folly?\"\nThey were playing at pioneers this anniversary, she and Gemin and a hundred of their friends, all packed into a replica of one of the earliest space-stations. Gemin had trawled the Grid for its twelve-thousand year-old design, and had delved deep into the acid black to bring back screechy sounds he claimed were period music. Now they danced and swayed to the brittle noise in the spaceship dock, staring at shiny metal and sloppy paint and lumpy rivets and ancient glyphs too stubborn for the Grid to resolve into meaning.\n\"It's just a silly spinning wheel,\" Meri said.\n\"It was a grand gesture!\"\nMeri shrugged. Even in first-level Mesh, she sensed giggles and whispers and gasps from a few of the more adventurous couples who were exploring the endless curving passageways, the cramped crew's quarters; peering out the tiny windows that looked down on the greening Earth. Probably imagining themselves living at the edge of a great age, when incredible dreams could come true.\nGemin bent her low as the music ground to an end. \"Then I must try harder.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"Our five hundredth is coming,\" she said, teasing.\nHe shrugged. \"Light off Jupiter and turn it into another sun, spin the moons into our names encircling an eternal fire?\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Disassemble all the planets and build a ringworld?\"\n\"You can't do that!\"\n\"Twin ourselves into Travelers and visit the extrasolar worlds?\"\n\"Brr!\"\nGemin nodded and took her in his arms, as the music ground to a start once again. \"I know. I don't know. I'll think of something.\"\nIn first-level Mesh, Gemin's love was like a well-banked fire, warm and comforting. It made her earlier fear of . . .\n(Accord)\n. . . seem silly and far-away.\nThen Gemin whirled her back into the music, and Meri was content for a time to be cradled in his arms under the riveted metal ceiling of a bygone age.\nBut as she danced, she couldn't help dropping into second-level Mesh. And hearing.\nHow are they architecting it? Through the Grid?\nNo. They're not using the Nodes. The engines of change are separate, buried in the dark spaces of the world.\nWill some of us become sorcerers?\nI don't know.\nMeri knew all the words. The New Alchemy. Technology making magic again. They would wake up one day and it would just be there. Sorcerers and magicians doing all manner of impossible things. A new kind of beauty and adventure, returned to this perfect age of Accord.\nAnd we won't remember the past?\nNo. It will be as if it has always been.\nWe won't remember we made it happen?\nWhy think of poorer times?\nEveryone reaching for Accord. For the monumental time when humanity would decide: we make ourselves what we are. We move forward, knowing we cannot look back.\nA thin voice, like a tickle in the back of her mind: If you cannot look back, can you remember what you are?\nAnd Meri suddenly knew what she feared in that breathless shivering rush of excitement that was building towards Accord. How much could she lose. Could she lose Gemin's perfect love? Could she lose herself?\n\"I don't want it,\" she said.\n\"What?\"\n\"The New Alchemy.\"\nA flash of concern. \"Meri, why?\"\n\"I don't want to lose you!\" Suddenly, tears were close.\nGemin led her off the impromptu dance floor and took her to a tall, cold metal table on the edge of the room. He put his hands over hers, warm against the chill aluminum.\n\"You will not lose me,\" Gemin said. In second-level Mesh, his love keened and wailed its pain, sending feelings of hands softly stroking.\n\"How do you know?\"\nA smile. \"I have confidence in the Architects of Change. And I think it would be a beautiful thing to have magic back in the world. Imagine the epic quests and adventures we can have!\"\n\"Will it really be like that?\"\n\"What we imagine, we are. That is our choice.\"\n\"I don't want to forget!\"\n\"Meri . . .\"\nShe felt a warm wind blow through her mind. Gemin had dropped into third-level Mesh, using the power of the Grid to examine the depths of her mind.\n\"Dear Meri,\" he said. \"This won't change what we really are. Not in five hundred years. Not in five thousand.\"\nGemin swam in her tear-brimming eyes. She was so lucky to have found a love like him. He understood. She felt it. It was silly to think anything else.\n\"We haven't reached Accord yet,\" Gemin said.\nBut we will, she thought. The crowd in the space station had already decided. And their friends were powerful, influential. If they thought it, it would happen.\n\"Will we be the same?\" she said softly.\nGemin pretended not to hear. He whirled her out onto the dance-floor again, as if he could spin the thoughts from her head.\nAfter spinning down the space station and dropping it into the Pacific, Meri convinced Gemin to go to Mars. To go back to their first house, to relive some of those ancient memories, those first touches, those first purely physical discoveries.\nTheir little crystal house woke slowly to their presence, as if sulking over the decades they'd been away. They had sweeping views of rolling Martian valley, greening in Marsfern under a light-blue sky. Far-away, the curve of a canal was just barely visible, its silt still wet from the spring melts. On its bank was a lumpy, misshapen ruin of a city, one of those Martian things where the wind keened near-ultrasonic notes on chill fall days. Long-deserted, of course. The Martians wouldn't even admit their cities existed.\nMeri enjoyed the time alone with Gemin in all those old ways. Nights, they lay spent under the crystal dome, looking up at the cold stars. She wanted the change to come, to wash over her, to be done.\nAnd the Grid simmered with excitement. More and more people lent their minds to the New Alchemy every day. She felt the momentum building. The change would come. It was inevitable.\nAnd one day, that little whisper again: And what will you be, when it is done?\nMeri dropped into second-level Mesh, chasing the voice. It fled ahead of her into silence. For once, she wished she was a Grid-adept, able to harness the power of the Grid itself for third- and fourth-level Mesh.\nRestless, she rose with dawn to wander. Under a granite outcropping, a single Martian huddled. He looked like a half-decomposed leather handbag from a simpler time. His shell was cracked and gray with age. His slit eyes were filmed and bleary. He kept only three of his four long fingers on each hand. His indigo eyes swiveled up to meet hers. He let out a few sighing squeaks and blinked slowly.\nShe dropped into second-level Mesh for translation.\nMercurial provide ending, the Grid supplied.\nAre you in pain? she subvocalized, and let the Grid twist her voicebox into a series of hisses and squeaks.\nFatigued joke.\nUnderstood, Meri said.\nShe wondered if she should tell Gemin. He loved to talk with the Martians. They would sometimes go for days, asking questions upon questions until they reached one of such profundity that it could not be answered.\nMercurial changing?\nMeri nodded. She'd never understood the depth of the Martian shortspeak, but she could see how humans could seem mercurial and ever-changing to the slow-moving Martians.\nSorry, no questions, Meri said. Knowing that she could be there all day if they started.\nChange good?\nI'm sorry.\nPossible change without changing self?\nThat stopped her. Was it possible that this Martian knew about the New Alchemy?\nNo. The Grid acted only on human minds. Martians were outside of its influence. She shook her head and backed away. It followed her out into the sun, bleating.\nChange fear rational?\nBacking away.\nIt was completely out into the sun now, and she saw it was not just old but ancient, ravaged and twisted by time. It was perhaps the oldest Martian she'd ever seen.\nShe was afraid it would follow her to the house, but it stopped well short, hissing something that the Grid found untranslatable.\nEvery time she looked, it was still there, waiting for her. She saw Gemin looking at it, too. But he never went outside to talk to it.\nBack on Earth, they did the Atlantis tour with Alvis and Heu and Petr and Ryovi, sharing an excellent apartment that overlooked the 35,000-year-old ruins. The great basalt pillars still trickled salt water from deep cracks; though they'd known where Atlantis lay for thousands of years, they'd only raised the ocean floor recently. They trekked through the dark hallways where stone and metal had been joined with strange gem-like machines, some of which still glowed faintly within. Infographics crowded her second-level Mesh, trying to explain Atlantean science in terms of nanotechnology and basal resonance, humor and the Singular Soul. She understood very little of it, but the sculptures were massive, graceful, and even beautiful at times.\nAnd when everything has changed, what new fancies will exist? That whisper. Louder. Meri crashed hard into second-level Mesh and chased it again. This time, there was something like the glint of faint sunlight on a dark planet, just the barest outline of a mind behind the thought.\nOne night after too much wine, lying in a comfortable tangle on the lawn outside their apartment, Heu said, \"You worry unnecessarily.\"\nHis thoughts were close, and she took them. \"I don't want to lose what we have.\"\nAlvis smiled. \"So few have your devotion.\"\nGemin reached out and took her hand, sending feelings of comfort and warmth. She snuggled closer to him, looking up at the softly-glowing orange Nodes in orbit, the physical manifestation of the Grid. At that moment, she wanted nothing more than to be lost in his arms.\n\"It would be terrible to miss a five hundredth,\" Ryovi said.\n\"She will not,\" Heu said.\n\"Are you all for New Alchemy?\" Meri said.\nNods. A yes from Heu.\nThen, from Petr, a soft, \"No.\"\n\"Petr!\" Ryovi said.\nHe shook his head. \"It's how I feel.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"It seems like . . . it seems like too much.\"\n\"Too much?\" Ryovi asked.\n\"How much change does it take before we cease being human?\"\nSilence for a time.\n\"You sound like the paranoids who say 'if we do it once, we'll do it again.'\"\nPetr shook his head. Meri dropped into second-level Mesh and probed. But his thoughts didn't match that soft, sinister voice that started it all.\nShe did catch a whisper-thought passing from Gemin to Heu:\nOr like the ones who say we've changed ourselves before. With chill humor, directed at her.\nGemin's warm and loving thoughts quickly returned. But that one alien thought echoed in her mind, growing stronger with each reverberation. Gemin had never thought hurt like that.\nShe frowned and took her hand from his, and shielded when he probed. He probably caught her thoughts anyway, but she didn't care. There was a crack in the fa\u00e7ade of their lives. Hairline and almost unnoticeable, perhaps. Not something to worry about, in almost five hundred years of history.\nBut it was there.\nLike the voice.\nMeri spent the next day deep in second-level Mesh, almost oblivious to the beauties of Atlantis. Waiting for the voice. She opened, and waited, and let the babble of humanity fill her mind.\nThere were people who believed that the New Alchemy was only the opening entr\u00e9e in a feast of change that would forever alter what humanity was. There were a few who believed that humanity had changed themselves before, holding up obscure evidence from archeological digs that seemed to contradict some of the facts everyone knew about the world, or strange data from almost-forgotten nets that could be nothing but pure fabrication. Together, both groups formed the kernel that prevented Accord, the concentrated effort of their passions swamping the more casual will of the majority.\nBut she could plot the trend. It was too spiky to predict a when, but the anti-New Alchemy faction would lose.\nLate in the day, she felt dry rustlings at the edge of the Grid, rustlings that spoke of a different path. Rustlings with the tenor of that voice.\nWhat are you? she said, straining to deepen her second-level Mesh.\nThen, that voice, faint and screechy, like a recording from the beginning of time: The doubts have etched your mind.\nTell me who you are!\nYou don't remember me.\nMeri stopped. She was vaguely aware of Petr and Heu frowning at her. They were in some Atlantean temple where a great flame glowed and danced eternally above a basalt altar. She forced herself to wave a hand, smile, and walk with the group.\nNo. But there was something, wasn't there.\nIt doesn't matter.\nSomething familiar.\nI . . . Meri began.\nI can help you stop this Accord.\nMeri felt a rush of relief. She wouldn't change! She wouldn't have to be afraid. But it was too easy, too convenient. Are you sending this emotion?\nNo. Fading.\nDon't go! Meri cried.\nYou must come to me. Reaching into the Grid is . . . Fading.\nWhere are you?\nNo voice. Just images of cold expanses of space beyond Mars, together with an image of a couple, whirling softly on an strangely-familiar beach. Finally, the sharp-edged peaks of an asteroid and coordinates.\nSo far?\nConfusion. Feelings of sitting and yearning beside a window, pining for some ancient loss. Then, almost inaudibly: Because you remember.\nAnd somewhere, deep down, she did.\nBut it was insanity. She would be away for weeks. Gemin would . . .\nHe would what? Laugh at you again?\nShe looked at him, standing on the altar. He grinned down at her, but his grin quickly dimmed when he felt her storm of emotion.\n\"I have to go,\" Meri said.\nSomewhere in the asteroid belt, in the space between humanity's outposts on Mars and Europa, the grasp of the Grid fell away. She could feel the buzz of humanity receding behind her, all the hopes and dreams and wishes and worries. It was as if her mind were slipping away, leaving only an empty shell. She looked at things and saw only surface. She tried to drop into second-level Mesh, and heard only silence.\nEventually, in the rich velvet darkness, she forgot who she was.\nShe awoke to a man with long, dark hair and a thin, ascetic face of almost mechanical precision. His blue eyes shaded towards violet. It was a style thousands of years past. He leaned over her, the glowing jewel of a mechanical Gridlink glowing behind one ear. Above him, a transparent dome held the black at bay, and the sun picked at the edges of three graceful space-ships, hanging motionless.\n\"Where am I?\" she said.\nThe man twitched a crooked grin, bleeding heavy irony. \"With the ones who came back.\"\nMeri shook her head. She was empty, still empty. \"Who are you?\"\n\"You don't remember?\"\n\"I'm empty.\" Said slow like her thoughts.\n\"I am Een Vorgia.\"\nShe shook her head. But. His face. Those ships. His thin, sorry smile. Was there something? Something dancing on the corner of her mind?\n\"You do remember,\" Een said\nCatching it with his mechanical Gridlink, she thought.\n\"Why do you use that?\" she said, nodding at it.\n\"To fish the pool of the Grid without drowning,\" he said. \"A choice that nobody on earth has had for the last eleven thousand years.\"\nChoosing to be inhuman, Meri thought. Because access to the Grid was part of the definition of humanity.\n\"The Grid is still getting to you,\" Een said. \"Bleed from the Martian and Jovian Nodes. Go out past Saturn, and you might not be able to think. You've offloaded so much of our minds into the Grid it's almost impossible to leave it.\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"We're the Gilded Ones, the Segundo Dorado.\"\nMeri shook her head. It meant nothing.\nEen didn't say anything. He gathered her in his arms. He smelled of coriander and roses and black pepper. A tailored scent, hauntingly familiar.\n\"You've cut us out of your past,\" he said.\n\"What are you?\" she said, pushing him away.\nEen was silent for a long time. He looked up at the three ships. \"We're your last, great folly. Or you are ours. Most want to leave Earth and return to Guatavita, though it is as unknowable as what you have become.\"\n\"You're not making any sense.\"\n\"We are the last physical expedition to the stars, the one sent to the second planet where intelligent life was found. We've been gone almost six thousand years. Do you even remember the Long New Days?\"\nMeri shook her head.\nEen squeezed his eyes shut. \"You have lost everything.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Where do I start? With the fact that Atlantis was nothing but a myth, until you made it real? Or that that there were never any Martians or Europans until you created them? Or the other human species that you created, then destroyed when they'd served their purpose?\"\n\"There have always been Martians!\"\n\"And there will always have been sorcerers and magicians, once this Accord is reached.\"\nMeri sat up, feeling something like a cold hand at her neck. Her hair felt electrified, standing on end.\n\"Your body knows I'm right.\"\n\"Why me?\"\nA sigh. Een held out a mechanical Gridlink.\n\"No,\" she said, recoiling from the tiny glowing jewel. \"It'll burn out my mind.\"\n\"That's what the adepts want you to think.\"\nMeri took it. It was warm. She placed it behind her ear. It scrabbled in her hair like an insect. A small voice spoke in her mind, telling her to call it Elaine.\n\"Ignore it,\" Een said. \"It has no mind.\"\n\"I'm not connected.\"\n\"Think 'connect' and 'OK'.\"\nShe did. Images flooded into her mind. Screams and babbles and symphonies. A storm of raw data, impossible to grasp.\n\"Think 'first-level filtering',\" Een said.\nShe did. The torrent stopped abruptly. The babble of feelings and thoughts felt much the same as they always had in second-level Mesh.\nEen sent a series of images, powerful even for second-level Mesh. A woman, holding hands with a man as they walked along a Orida seashore at dusk. They paused, embraced, kissed. The woman's eyes sparkled with the fire of love. They whirled, the woman's mouth open in delight. The woman looked nothing like herself\nYou have changed much in six thousand years.\nThe same two again, exploring a brick-red Martian canyon. Both wearing something over their heads. Something attached to a little pack on their backs.\nBecause Mars didn't have a breathable atmosphere back then.\nStrange monuments in a barren Martian valley, with the same two people cross-legged on the ground, holding hands. It was Landing Point, where the first humans met the first Martians. But there were no canals. There was no Marsfern. No lichentree. Nothing. Just dusty salmon-colored sand and rock.\n\"I . . . this . . . you made this!\"\nEen shook his head, sadly, once.\n\"It's not me!\"\nBut Meri knew it was. It was her. And it was Een. And there was a great gaping hole in the middle of her mind. With a great start, she realized she didn't even know her real age.\nWhat have I done? What have we done? Meri shook her head.\n\"Show me,\" she told Een.\nHe showed her the DNA analysis of the Martian flora and fauna that mapped it to Earthly archetypes. He showed her the designs of the vitrified pillars where they built Atlantis. He showed her the changes going on in the Venusian atmosphere, preparing it for its own transformation.\nHe showed her four different versions of humanity, made by humans, none of which existed anymore. He showed her the age before theirs, the Long New Days that had launched the Nodes of the Grid.\nHe took her through case after case, until the world was stripped to its bleak core. Looking at it, she couldn't believe. Nothing could be so terrible.\n\"There's only us? We're alone in the universe?\" she said.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"No Martians? No Europans? No dolphins?\"\n\"There is the Dark Life, and the Palos, and the Chichiree, and that is all.\" With each term, a flash of meaning: Black worlds, seething with intelligence; bundles of pale sticks singing unknown melodies in the shallows of an alien ocean; things that were at once insectile and mechanical, laboring at humanoid sculptures. \"All of them extrasolar. None of them knowable.\"\n\"We're barren.\"\nEen nodded. He put a hand on her shoulder. \"Not anymore.\"\nPetr's voice came back to her: How much change before we cease being human?\n\"Why?\" Meri said.\n\"Because you can,\" Een said. \"If I had lived here, immersed in this power, it would be nearly impossible not to use it.\"\nMeri just looked at him. \"No. Us. Why didn't we stay together?\"\nEen looked away. He said nothing for a long time. Finally, he sighed and looked at her, tears spilling down his face. \"Because intensity stays only if the longing is there,\" he said.\nIn her mechanically-assisted Mesh, she saw Een bent at the knee, pleading, a great cityscape in the background. She saw people smiling and frowning at him. She could almost hear the words. And then she turned away.\n\"We have intensity, Gemin and I,\" she said.\nA sad look.\n\"We do!\"\n\"I couldn't bear to adulterate the purity of our love.\"\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\"Ask yourself,\" he said. \"How quickly memories pass, how quickly things become new again.\"\n\"I don't see . . .\"\n\"He's changed you. Made you what you are.\"\nShe shook her head and tried to protest, but Een wouldn't listen to her. His eyes went glassy and unfocussed.\n\"Go,\" he said. \"Before my love overrides my principles.\"\nEventually, she did.\nThe True History of the World was a sensation. For the next month, all Meri heard about was the True History. At parties with the most stylish, glowing radiant in Arthurian fashions they now knew to be fabrication. At their house in Paris, when friends came to endure Petr's smirks. When they went out at night, to fly with borrowed wings above the streets of a simpler age, or to careen though the alleys in replicas of old-fashioned internal combustion cars. The True History eclipsed the New Alchemy. The fever-pitch need for change receded into recent memory. No longer did she feel impending Accord.\nThe archive she'd brought back in the mechanical mind of her Gridlink ignited debates that raged around the world. Scientists and philosophers went to test the foundations of Atlantis. More analyses were done of Martians, of Europans, of dolphins. A hundred puzzled archeologists appeared and shared results they'd been hiding for years, results that didn't fit with the common theories. Most of them fit the True History.\nThere was an actual recession from support for New Alchemy. Now, when Meri went out, the thoughts were all of the need for stability, a new foundation, something solid to build from.\nAnd the question: Will the Gilded Ones rejoin us? Will they share their tales, their stories, their adventures?\nBut even with the help of the mechanical Gridlink, Meri couldn't answer that. Een was silent, and dark emotions surged in the minds of the people of the Segundo Dorado. Een had breached some contract she couldn't understand.\nGemin cried and threw himself at her feet.\n\"Don't go to Een,\" he said. \"I don't remember altering you. If I did, I am sorry. But I am like one of two stones, sharing a cold riverbed for ages. Worn smooth by each other, I fit no one else.\"\nMeri looked at him with the cold mechanical talent of the Gridlink. She found nothing but a feeling, a cold little thing that gibbered and laughed in its own mechanical way. But his words had the feeling of a script.\nShe went out on her own for a time, and took a half-dozen lovers in quick succession. They were new and different, but the act was so much the lesser without the warmth of a five-hundred-year love stoking it. Afterward, she felt cool and detached, empty and alone.\nTalk to me, she asked Een, pushing the Gridlink until it was warm on her neck and Elaine's emotionless voice screamed danger.\nI should not, Een said, finally.\nCan't you restore our memories? She asked him. Can't you make us what we once were?\nNo. Too much time, too long ago.\nBut you remember them.\nNot enough.\nHe was lying.\nMeri cut the connection. She was more than cold; frigid. She was more than alone; apart. No chance of connection. Her emotions had bled gray. She was sterile.\nOut to a party in what used to be the North American desert, listening to someone talk about how this part of the world was verifiably true and real, Meri caught:\nCan't believe it is so bleak. Only us. No other life.\nThat's why we created it.\nAnd the Kin. How could we kill them?\nBecause we're human.\nWe're alone now.\nWe always were.\nEchoing silence.\nWhen thoughts of the True History began falling out of the Grid, Meri was almost happy. She'd lived with the buzz of the entire world in her head, half ecstatic about building a new foundation for a better reality, and half looking for flaws in the True History. And there were flaws. In many places, it contradicted itself. Especially the religious myths.\nBut perhaps that was how it had always been, she thought. Nothing completely knowable. Everything in shades of gray. People fighting over the sharp edges on the corners of the facts, unable to ever reach Accord.\nAnd that was the danger. Accord. To change again, to move even farther from what was human\n(but was that bad)\nto give up even the pretense of striving for more. Perhaps Segundo Dorado hadn't gone far enough. Perhaps they should recall the acorporeal Travelers and access their memories. They'd spread much farther in six thousand years. Perhaps they'd found companionship\n(or changed themselves)\nMeri used the power of the Gridlink to call to the world. She brought bodies together in what used to be Rio de Janerio. Only a few grass-covered mounds, too regular to be natural, marked the fact that humans had ever lived there. She stood atop Sugarloaf mountain and looked out at the upturned faces of almost half a million people. About a quarter of a percent of the entire human race. Insignificant in number, significant in their assembly. They had come to hear her rallying cry.\nMeri felt Een watching, through the amplified senses of the mechanical Gridlink. Many of the Gilded Ones, in fact, watched with emotions that surged between surly doubt and shining hope.\nShe looked down at the crowd. She opened her mouth. And in that moment, she heard Een's words. Intensity stays only if the longing is there.\nShe saw a brief love with him, then millennia of different lovers. Each time, burning that intensity until it was gone.\nWas that what she'd done in the past? The True History hadn't restored her own memories. She imagined ghosts of herself, searching for that intensity, looking for new ways to make it last.\nYou must have found something in Gemin, she thought.\nThe people looked up at her, a pinprick on a great stone dais. None of them could hear her, except through the Grid. She could feel the stirrings of impatience.\nShe tried to speak. No words came.\nThe Grid was humanity. Humanity had lived with the Grid for two-thirds of their civilized timeline.\n\"I'm sorry, she said, and turned away.\nFar, far away, she felt Een sob.\nMeri went back to Gemin in the fall. He was staying at their little cabin in what used to be New Zealand. Green and verdant and perfect land. She wondered for a moment if it was real, or if it was something humanity had created.\nShe walked in. He looked up. And she knew.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said.\n\"There's no need,\" Gemin said, taking her in his arms. He felt warm and strong and good. Meri felt the love baking off of him, like the heat from an oven.\nWho cares how it was made? Meri thought. It was good. She was happy. And that was all that mattered.\nWhen people began to talk about New Alchemy again, she thought about using the Gridlink again to remind everyone about the True History. She saw herself drawing crowds, reminding everyone of their heritage. But she remembered the crowd in Rio. The Gridlink sat on their table, unused.\nThe True History slipped out of the Grid.\nThe clamor for New Alchemy grew louder and more strident. It swelled quickly to a crescendo, much more quickly than before. What took years before took weeks this time.\nLike an addiction, Een's thin voice came again. But it was one tiny voice in the crescendo. She could feel almost a hundred million voices raised in frantic need, clamoring for New Alchemy. They echoed and reverberated in her mind, even in first-level Mesh.\nMeri sat alone, looking out over their land. No lights marred the smooth darkness of their valley. It was a quarter moon, and the hills were painted in textures of black on black. The stars above shone down steadily, silently, almost as if they were holding their breath.\nGemin found her and came to sit.\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said.\n\"Nothing to be sorry about.\"\nFeelings of happiness and contentment. \"I'm glad.\"\nSilence for a time.\n\"Let's sleep,\" Meri said. \"And wait for the new day.\"\nOne tiny whisper, before she fell into the darkness. Een.\nGemin changed you, but before that, you changed him.\nImages came to her. Her, choosing Gemin. Her, engineering him for devotion, using the crude techniques of fourth-level Mesh. Then forgetting she was an Adept, forgetting that she'd done anything at all.\nYou are both parasites. You deserve each other.\nMeri smiled, unable to make herself sad.\nChange, rapid and profound.\nMeri awoke, bathed in the warmth of love. She was only one of the lowest concubines in Gemin the sorcerer's harem, but he'd chosen her to come with him to this mysterious little house, where he was undoubtedly working on a new spell.\nIt had been a long time since she'd known love, and she was content to just lie there and let the golden morning sun stream over her. Gemin had already bounced up and was packing his things.\nShe felt a strange thought resonating in Gemin's mind, like the remnant of a dream. Free, he thought. Free free free.\nMeri wondered what it meant. But then his mind clamped shut. In first-level Mesh, she felt nothing. Even his love was fading.\nA sorcerer's love is a momentary thing, she thought. You knew this when you joined his harem.\nSo why do I feel so alone?\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Jason Stoddard.

'Best of the Best' had been Kanada Yoshimoto's only number one. It had caused quite a stir a few years back, managing to stay in the charts for an astounding period of two weeks. The longest anybody else had managed in the preceding years had been nine days, and that had been with an Elvis remix. Post-Best of the Best no one had managed to surpass a single week at the top-spot, the average stay at number one being a meagre two and a half days.\nReagan folded the letter in half and, having scored a crease in it with his thumbnail, slipped it in the inside pocket of his jacket. Although he was late for a dinner-date with one of the richest women in the Antipodes, he appeared outwardly composed.\nAs he made his way from his penthouse suite down to the mall-level, briefcase in hand, Reagan checked his emessages in the relative privacy of the hotel elevator. Less than a minute later, and with over three hundred correspondences, newsletters and advertisements checked and responded to or deleted \u2013 including the quarter-hourly World Chart Update \u2013 Christopher Reagan, one-time A&R agent for Silver Publishing, the US's premiere music publishers, and of late chief executive of Gotown Records, emerged into the organised chaos of the Edo Media Share Centre, younger but bigger brother to the more reserved \u2013 and in Reagan's mind, more stuffy and outdated \u2013 Old Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nHe barged his way through to the Gotown private offices with little effort, standing head and shoulders above most of the dealers, agents, and media planners and buyers who'd been screaming at one another since dawn had broken over the grubby city.\nThe double doors to Gotown HQ were apparently shut. Occupying the respectful space left around the entrance, Reagan took a hit of speed before stepping through the holographic image of the doors and into the elaborate foyer beyond.\nThe receptionist was busy painting her nails. She must've been watching something on her EGs; either that or she was high, because she didn't react to Reagan's presence until he attempted to rap on her head with the knuckles of his free hand. The young lady had a katana blade at his throat before he could complete the action.\n'Mister Reagan, you are late. Mrs Townsend is impatient this morning.'\nWithout further words he left the nu-ronin enthusiast and crossed the marble floor of the atrium, keying in the security code for access to Keiko's office.\nKeiko Townsend had inherited Gotown after her husband's grim and not unexpected demise. She was a political force to be reckoned with. Having played a major part in reinstating provincial rule across much of Japan, she was puppet-master to several of the more popular candidates for Shogun of the newly consolidated Edo and Greater Tokyo prefecture.\nTellingly, it had also been under pressure from her that a sociological report on a cross-section of the city's youth had been conducted, resulting in the reinstatement of the old caste system, and along with it the Samurai code and the re-legalisation of hand-weapons.\nKeiko was spread-eagled, a concubine's head between her slender legs, upon a leopard-skin sofa.\n'Hello Christopher. What kept you? You've missed most of the \u2013 uhn \u2013 fun.' And then to her servant, 'Enough. Send in the girl.'\nThe woman, dressed as a geisha, did as instructed. Keiko crossed her legs.\n'You've heard from Yoshimoto?'\nReagan nodded. 'I'm not convinced he'll go for this. His letter was pretty apathetic.'\n'Yoshimoto is not a stupid man, Chris. Besides, he's desperate. Everyone has a price. I suspect his is pretty low at the moment.'\n'Is fame such a low price? You might be powerful Keiko, but you're not invincible.'\n'And there was me thinking you were a gambler.'\n'Just considering all the angles.'\nKeiko slid into a sitting position. 'Pass me that robe.'\nShe was fastening the gown's belt when Lindy entered.\n'You wanted to see me?' the girl asked.\n'Take a seat, dear,' Keiko instructed, 'we want to talk to you about the launch. We both think you've got something special, my love.' Keiko touched the girl's knee. 'Everyone knows you'll win over the J-Poppers for at least, ooh, I don't know . . . Chris?'\nReagan shifted uncomfortably where he stood, hands in his trouser pockets. 'A week. At least a week,' he assured them.\nLindy's eyes grew wide. 'A week? Wow! You really think the track's good enough?'\nKeiko smiled, almost naturally.\n'Oh, Lindy, darling. We think you're good enough.'\nLindy turned to Reagan for confirmation.\n'That's right,' he said, with a flash of his whiter-than-white teeth.\n'Geez!'\n'Indeed. It's because we think you're so good, sweetheart, that we want to do something pretty radical. We think you've got crossover potential.'\n'What do you mean?' Lindy's cartoon-like features turned quizzical.\n'The Samurai, babes.'\n'You mean, the Shogunate?'\nKeiko laughed. 'Hell no, princess,' Lindy was completely out of touch with the urban scene. 'The nu-ronin, my lovely. The kids in black.'\n'You mean those guys with swords and switchblades? The ones who hang around the subways and outside clubs? Daddy says they're dangerous; that they'd cut you up just as soon as look at you.'\nReagan interceded, 'But they've got money, Lindy, and they spend an awful lot of it on music. Just as much \u2013 if not more \u2013 as the J-Poppers. If you could nail both audiences, maybe we could even beat Yoshimoto's record!' Reagan was zealously enthusiastic, in his subdued manner. If he'd been as caricature-like as Lindy, Yen signs would have been ringing up in his eyes like dollars on a cash register.\n'You mean Kanada? Best of the Best? Daddy loves that song!'\nKeiko sidled over to Lindy's side. 'You know what would make Daddy love that song even more, sweetpea?' She draped an arm over the girl's shoulders, reminiscent of Kaa with Mowgli. 'If you sang it!' She continued, answering her own question.\nLindy was visibly moved at the prospect. She started to tremble.\n'And for the coup de gr\u00e2ce, Lindy,' Reagan began.\n'To add the cherry on top\u2014' Keiko interjected, '\u2014A live concert!' They finished the sentence together. Lindy squealed with delight.\nA week before the show, pictures of Lindy were pasted across every spare surface of the city. Gotown's marketing department ceased work on all other projects and hired freelancers and college students to assist them with the donkeywork of making Lindy a household name.\nHer bubblegum-pop face had been superimposed into two separate poster designs. In one she was dressed as a schoolgirl, standing on one alabaster leg, index finger suggestively in her mouth. She was wearing a white blouse and pleated blue skirt.\nIn the other picture she wore a black gi and wielded a Bokken in a defensive Bushido stance. In both pictures the legend above her head read: Lindy, Better than the Best!!!\nLindy's version of Best of the Best did beat Kanada's previous record and spent an unprecedented two months at the top of the J-Chart following the gig, with the re-release of Kanada's original hugging the number two spot for almost as long.\nYoshimoto was scheduled for a private execution the very evening following the concert, but after Reagan had a few choice words in his ear, he opted for a televised suicide by self-disembowelment in the boardroom of the Edo Media Share Centre. A wide smile split his face at the same time the sword split his belly. A rousing chorus accompanied Kanada's auto-execution:\n'Don't fear Death's aim\nIt got almost as many viewers as Lindy's funeral did.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Neil Ayres.

Large red letters on the turrets spelled out B-U-D-W-E-I-S-E-R and negated the usefulness of the camouflage paint. The tanks threw up clouds of Fort Dix sand and scattered swarms of gnats.\nHe activated his cell phone and heard a lilting female voice say, \"My panty liner is so wonderfully soft and absorbent that I don't even\u2014\" He held the phone away from his ear and wished the Pentagon would go back to using radios. Once the commercial finished, he called his lieutenants in charge of the rifle platoons, \"Move out!\" He clicked his stop watch.\nThe three rifle platoons stood up and moved towards the slope.\n\"Faster!\" Stiller yelled into the phone. \"Get those troops running!\" Speed would help determine which unit won the grand prize and there was a lot of money at stake.\nThe lieutenants yelled and waved their arms; the soldiers trotted up the hill. Their bobbing heads transformed the Golden Arches decal on the back of their helmets into moving bands of color. They all wore a red-and-white bulls-eye patch below the division badge on their shoulders. The patch was the logo of the department store that was the official sponsor of his infantry unit. Stiller's wife liked the extra discount she received there on diapers for their infant daughter.\nThe soldiers fired from the hip\u2014as stipulated by the producer to increase the drama\u2014even though none of them could see a target. The bullets kicked up sand and rock splinters along the crest of the hill.\nRecording the action, two camera crews stood on the beds of a pair of 4X4 trucks. Overhead, a helicopter circled the hill providing a different perspective. Blue and white letters identified the trucks and helicopter as part of the World-Wide Broadcasting Corporation.\n\"Come on.\" Stiller beckoned to Mathis, his company sergeant. They climbed the hill and were swallowed by an acrid cloud of cordite left behind by the rifle fire.\nA hum-vee plastered with so many logos that it wouldn't be out of place at a NASCAR race rolled after the rifle platoons. The vehicle carried the two umpires and the referee in charge of scoring.\nWhen the first rifleman reached the hilltop, Stiller clicked his stop watch: four minutes, thirteen seconds. Much less than the five minutes the goddamn producer allocated to the move. He should be happy with the time and with his men firing a truck-load of ammo to make his video look good.\nHis phone buzzed. \"Sir,\" the first platoon lieutenant said. \"I counted forty-five people alive. A fifty-five percent Kill-Ratio is an outstanding score, sir. Much better than anything I've seen from other units.\"\n\"Keep looking for more survivors.\" His stomach threatened outright rebellion. Out of a hundred illegal immigrants penned into the village, less than half had survived and would be allowed to stay in the country.\nHe and Mathis reached the village. The mortar-blasted area offered no shade from the mid-summer sun. Waves of heat radiated from the sandy soil and distorted everything in view. His troops faced a long, hot afternoon. Stiller removed his sunglasses and wiped the sweat from his face with his sleeve. He found a spot where he had a view of the slopes and established his command post. A quick assessment of the area told him the counter-attack would come from the woods closest to the village, either the north-western or western slopes.\n\"I want the first platoon facing west,\" he told the assembled lieutenants, \"the second fronting northwest and third due north. The woods on the east are too far away from the slopes, so I don't expect any trouble from that direction. Any questions?\" He looked at the two men and a woman. All much younger than he. \"Okay, go and set up your troops.\"\nThe referee walked over and gave him a signed form, the official tally. Fifty-two killed. Good. They found a few more survivors and he still had a great Kill-Ratio.\nHe and his men lunched on cold rations while a convoy of ambulances transported the survivors. After the last vehicle left the hill, the referee displayed his wristwatch to Stiller. \"The counter-attack can take place anytime after fifteen minutes from . . . now.\"\nStiller nodded his understanding. The next event was deadly and involved a mob of people desperate enough to attack professional troops. Soon, five hundred bankrupt citizens, armed with machine pistols and high on booze and drugs would try to take the village from his company.\nDuring the Terrorist Wars, Congress revamped the justice system and tilted it to benefit for-profit institutes. Insolvency was now a crime punishable by stiff prison sentences because individual bankruptcies lowered the profits of the lending companies. The Attorney-General then cut a deal with the entertainment industry to give the felons a chance to get out of debt while reducing the number of expensive jail cells required. The Attorney-General proclaimed the arrangement a victory for the taxpayers.\n\"Captain?\" Sergeant Mathis look worried. \"I can't get air support.\" He waggled his cell phone over his head.\nStiller frowned.\n\"All I get is a loud squeal.\"\nStiller punched the power button on his cell phone. Nothing but noise. Not even a commercial! He leaned on a mound of rubble to keep his knees from buckling. Bile flooded the back of his mouth and left him with a horrid taste.\nIt had to be the producer! What was the fat fuck's name? . . . Zephyr . . . Zachery Z. Zephyr. 'Z-Cubed', as he liked to be called. The sonuvabitch wanted more bloodshed so he blocked the requests for air support. Without the cell phone, he also couldn't direct the fire of his weapons platoon at the base of the hill, and his riflemen had used most of their ammunition on the way up the hill. He looked around for the camera trucks that should be in the village with his men. Both crews were still at the bottom of the hill, drinking beers. Even worse, the hum-vee with the officials sped down the hill to join them. Stiller almost threw up his lunch.\nHe took a deep breath. The whole day was an outrage. First, he had to shell the illegal immigrants because it was too expensive to send them back to their native countries. Second, he had to fight off a frenzied mob of bankrupt people. Third, Zephyr put his men in extraordinary danger to punch up excitement and to increase the ratings of his reality show.\nIn the last year, his respect for the Pentagon had plummeted because they supported this gross and dangerous spectacle to placate the entertainment industry, amuse the public and earn money. He could take no more of this immoral charade and he resolved to resign his commission before the day ended.\nIf he survived.\nHe pulled out the canteen-shaped bottle of sports drink, took a swig, spit it out and wiped his lips with the back of his hand. \"Boisenberry! I hate that flavor.\"\nMathis chuckled and offered his own canteen. \"Coconut-kumquat.\"\n\"Gawd!\" Stiller swallowed a mouthful. \"How can the supply people accept this shit? Better round up some runners, Mathis. We'll have to do things the old-fashioned way.\"\nWhile he waited for the runners, he wondered if the other officers felt like he did. Two other rifle companies had undergone similar maneuvers recently. The producer would splice together a two-hour-long special from tapes of all the battles.\nMathis returned with three privates.\n\"Tell the platoon lieutenants I want an ammo check,\" Stiller told one of them. \"Fast.\" The runner sprinted towards the closest platoon. An idea sprang into his mind. To another runner, he said, \"Go down to the tanks and tell them to get their asses up here. Go! And don't come back without them.\"\nThe ammo report was as bad as he anticipated: an average of twenty rounds for each rifle. His troops didn't have enough ammo to stop a force of five hundred maniacal attackers. Not without air or heavy weapons support.\n\"Fix bayonets.\" The lieutenants looked at him as if he were insane. The soldiers hadn't practiced bayonet fighting since boot camp. The officers gave a terse order and the blades flashed in the sunlight. Every bayonet carried the logo of a condom company on both sides of the blade. \"Set all rifles on single shot,\" Stiller yelled. \"No automatic fire.\"\nMathis pointed in the air. The network helicopter swooped down and hovered behind the south side of the hill. Stiller frowned. The position of the chopper made no sense. If the attack echeloned to the north face of the hill, a distinct possibility, the helicopter would be in the line of fire.\nA deep growling noise interrupted his thoughts. Thank God! The two tanks, call names Bud-1 and Bud-2, bellied up the top of the slope with his runner on back of the lead tank. Stiller placed a tank on each of his flanks. With armor anchoring his lines, he felt a bit safer.\n\"Here they come!\" a soldier shouted. A burst from an automatic weapon sent bullets whizzing over Stiller's head. The soldiers in the second platoon returned the fire.\n\"Hold your fire!\" their lieutenant yelled. \"Wait 'til they get closer. Much closer.\"\nStiller moved towards the point of attack and sucked in his breath. Only fifty attackers ran up the slope. Where the hell were the other four-hundred-fifty? In answer to his question, gunfire and more shouts came from his rear. Bud-2 fired its cannon and opened up with its turret machine gun.\nThe fifty attackers flopped to the ground and sniped at his men. Stiller cursed at them. They would pin down a portion of his soldiers; troops needed to repulse the much larger attack. Someone had given the attackers a good strategy. Z-Cubed?\nStiller ran over to Bud-2 where heavy fire from the insolvents churned up the dirt on the edge of the hill. Protected by the bulk of the tank, he saw the main strength of the debtor force charge uphill on the east flank of the hill, an area undefended except for the tank. He had been outflanked! He backed away from the tank and grabbed a runner. \"Get the first platoon over here. Fast! You,\" he beckoned to another runner. \"Get the other tank.\"\nNow the position of the helicopter made sense. It hovered out of the line of fire of the attack and could take ground-level film of his men getting overrun.\nThe fire power of Bud-2 rattled the attackers and slowed them enough for the first platoon to move across the hill and drop into firing positions.\nTo the panting runner, Stiller said, \"Round up as much ammo as you can from the other platoons.\"\nThe defaulters slogged forward, firing their automatic pistols and howling, \"Debt free! For you and me!\"\nThe crack of weapons rose to a deafening volume then subsided, only to rise again.\n\"I'm hit!\" one of his soldiers yelled. The man gripped his forearm while blood flowed through his fingers.\nBud-1 joined the defense and the two tanks ripped holes in the attackers who surged forward but in smaller numbers. Stiller heard more screams followed by cries of \"Medic!\"\nThe cannon blasts, the steady fire from both the turret machine guns and the infantry broke the attack. The survivors retreated towards the woods and prison, their chance at economic redemption ended. The bodies of those who no longer needed a jail cell littered the slope. His men had executed a large number of people who wouldn't be guilty of a crime back in his parents' time. He gawked at the red-stained grass, then forced his mind back to business.\nHe waved to the commander of Bud-1 who stood in the open turret. Stiller pointed to the area in front of the first group of attackers. The tank commander nodded and the tank spun around, sending a shower of sand over the nearby soldiers.\n\"Get me a casualty report,\" Stiller told a runner. He saw a number of soldiers writhing on the ground.\nStiller heard a blast from Bud-1's cannon.\n\"Where you goin', cowards,\" a soldier near that tank yelled.\n\"Come on back and give us a fight,\" a second called out.\nWhen the runner returned, she reported, \"Sir, fifteen wounded. No KIA.\"\nStiller tried his phone. \"Now! Mortgage rates guaranteed to be lower than any other lending company\u2014\" He closed his eyes and held the phone against his shoulder until the spiel ended, then called for medical helicopters. Two arrived within minutes, one emblazoned MERCK and the other WYETH.\nStiller heard more approaching helicopters.\nA pair of them set down outside the village. One had WWBC on the side and the other COCA-COLA. To Stiller's surprise, the division commander, General Westly, jumped out of the red Coke bird followed by Colonel Maitland, his battalion commander. Both wore starched and pressed Class A uniforms in contrast to his rumpled, sweat-stained fatigues.\nZ-Cubed and a few go-fers climbed out of the WWBC helicopter. Z-Cubed wore an iridescent blue-green djellabah and yellow combat boots. Six-foot tall and weighing close to two-hundred-and-fifty pounds, the man's weight was concentrated in a huge paunch that stretched the material of the gown. A rubber band held his black hair in a pony tail but his untrimmed beard flowed in all directions. When Z-Cubed moved, the sunshine changed his djellabah into shimmering patterns of light that dazzled the eye. It was like looking into a bank of strobe lights. He kicked a rock, said something to a go-fer and backhanded the man in the chest.\nStiller came to attention, saluted the officers and watched for an opportunity to resign his commission.\nThe officers returned his salute.\n\"This man,\" Z-Cubed wagged a fat finger in Stiller's face, \"screwed up the whole production. Shoot him or hang him or whatever you do with traitors.\"\nStiller made a fist and shifted his weight. Before he could throw a punch, General Westly gripped Z-Cubed's elbow. \"That's how our officers respond when you fuck with them.\" Westly's voice came out like a snarl. \"You changed the script without telling him and he changed his tactics.\" He turned to Stiller and held out his hand. \"You turned a potentially bloody defeat into a victory. Well done, Captain.\"\n\"My boss loved the new script.\" Z-Cubed pounded a fist into an open palm. \"The public is tired of watching people get slaughtered by air strikes. Viewers want to see some dead-beats get to the top and win.\"\n\"Captain Stiller,\" Colonel Maitland said. \"Everyone in your command can now wear a combat badge.\"\nThe Pentagon hadn't been in a battle since the Terrorist Wars ended and almost everyone with combat experience had retired. The Pentagon's press releases justified these battles as a way to fill this experience gap. Stiller knew this was the 'good' reason given out to the media while the 'real' reason was making money.\n\"What am I supposed to tell him?\" Z-Cubed said, hands on hips. \"I couldn't shoot the script because an officer can't get his men killed properly?\"\nStiller cleared his throat to get the general's attention.\n\"You may not like it,\" General Westly replied, \"but Captain Stiller is a hero.\"\n\"He is?\" Z-Cubed gave the general a wary look.\n\"Sir, I want to res . . . I am?\" Stiller didn't feel like a hero. He felt like someone who had been used by unscrupulous people.\n\"He is. You are.\"\nZ-Cubed tapped his foot while he stared at Stiller. He made a frame out of his two thumbs and forefingers and sighted Stiller through it. \"My God! The man'll photograph like a movie star. Look at that jaw line. The strong nose. The blue eyes.\"\nStiller's mouth dropped open.\n\"I can see it now, General.\" Z-Cubed grinned. \"The show will feature this man as the heroic officer. We'll interview him before and after each film clip. He'll give us a voice-over of what's happening on those clips. Stiller'll be a national hero for his sterling defense against the low-life scum who dared to attack his unit.\"\nStiller gawked at Z-Cubed.\nZ-Cubed stroked his beard. \"Hmm . . . Our unspoken sub-text will be the superb training and adaptability of American officers.\" Z-Cubed hugged himself. \"This show will break all market share records. We can raise our advertising rates.\"\n\"I have an opening up at Division,\" General Westly said.\nStiller broke his opened-mouthed stare at Z-Cubed and turned to the general.\n\"I need someone to re-organize the training. Someone who can teach the rifle company officers to think under fire. I love the way you compensated for the lack of air strikes and mortars by using the tanks. I want you to teach these people how to think like that. By the way,\" Westly paused to give Stiller a smile, \"the position is to be filled by a major, so I'll have to promote you.\"\nStiller's mind threatened to shut down from the over-load, but before it did he postponed his resignation. After all, he had a family to support. It would be selfish to resign without talking it over with his wife.\n\"Not a bad day, Stiller,\" Colonel Maitland said. \"You put up a great fight, you'll be on national TV and you get a promotion.\"\n\"And you knocked off those undesirables,\" Z-Cubed said, \"in a most bloody and colorful fashion too. It'll be a TV classic in no time. The residuals alone will be worth a mountain of cash. You win the prize, Stiller. All ten million dollars.\"\nStiller blinked and tried to sort things out. His wife would love it that Wal-Mart sponsored the division staff and provided more lucrative discounts than the other store. His rifle company would split up the prize money. With his portion, he'd buy shares in Pentagon Inc., the subsidiary that owned all military advertising space and dealt with the corporations that wanted to rent some of it.\nHis resignation faded into oblivion. Maybe the Pentagon knew what it was doing.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Hank Quense.

A line of bumpy ridges like a croc's ran up his back and covered his head. Edu felt a tingle of fear in his spine. The Black Orophant smelt heavily of mulch and kind of like an elephant, but the elephants behind him smelt like nothing at all and this made Edu afraid.\n\"Do not fear us, though the time to be afraid has come,\" the Black Orophant said in a combination of gesture, breath and grunts.\n\"Who are they?\" Edu asked, stepping away. Locusts crawled all over the Orophant's back.\n\"They are the elders of herds long gone.\"\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" Edu said.\n\"You are going to see much that doesn't make sense, young one, but I need you to go now. Tell the herds the Black Orophant has come. Azilba, Lord of Lions, must know I am here and our plan is ready. Tell her that Phoenix is coming. I must stay to wake the rest of our warriors from slumber.\"\nEdu doubted Azilba of the Lions could be real, but here he stood in the presence of the Black Orophant and his herd. Things didn't make sense, but still he felt inspired.\nThe Black Orophant touched a bleached bone with his long curved tusks and another elephant rose as Edu ran from the graveyard.\nEdu did not stop running as the morning sun burned away the night and the long shadows of the banyan trees that peppered the dry plains. A group of impala trotted towards a nearby watering hole. Small songbirds flitted by, filling the air with color and music.\n\"It would be nice to stop by the water,\" he thought, but he was almost to where the herd waited \u2013 the edge of their world, near the south barrier wall. It towered over the tallest of trees, an endless monolith of gray and white stretching out to the horizon.\nKula had taught him that men built the barrier wall long ago to keep the herds and the animals isolated and safe.\nEdu stopped in his tracks. The breeze brought the smell of men and something oily to him. The impala bounded away, white undersides of their flicking tails revealed in warning. The songbirds went silent and landed in the trees. A tall white stork in the upper branches of a big banyan turned its slender neck, looking for danger. Edu walked up a grassy hill to look.\nA creature like none he had seen before scuttled across the brush towards the stork resting in the big tree. Its diamond-shaped, crystalline body, perched atop four spidery legs, turned and rotated while it crawled. Gracefully balanced on the tapered tips of its legs, it moved over the dry brush and low grass noiselessly.\n\"This must be a demon,\" Edu thought. \"This is what Kula warned me of.\"\nThe stork took flight with a disturbed squawk. Edu noticed three men hiding behind the big tree. In Edu's language there were no words for the body armor, big weapons, and power cells the men wore; but as he gazed upon them burdened with these things, he knew they looked bigger and bulkier than other men.\nThe demon neared the tree. Dozens of thin, fleshy, almost transparent tendrils snaked out of its crystalline body and waved in the air. Red flashes of light arced from their sparking tips, and sped to the banyan tree. The red light passed through the thick trunks as if they weren't there and engulfed the crouching men behind in flame. They slumped forward against the tree and the wind carried the stink of burnt flesh to Edu.\nFrom behind him, another group of men appeared and fired on the demon. Crackling blue beams, like focused lightning, cracked over Edu and bounced off the demon's crystal body. Electricity crackled down its long legs, dissipating into the ground.\nLegs planted, it rotated the top of its body. Red light raced at Edu from its tendril tips. He braced for pain but felt nothing as the beams passed through him. The firing from the men stopped and he turned to look. Gray and red smoke wafted from their slumped-over, lifeless forms.\n\"The red fire only hurts men. It passes right through trees and elephants,\" Edu thought.\nThe spidery demon scuttled halfway up the hill, then stopped a few yards from Edu. It had no eyes he could see, but he felt it watched him. The Black Orophant's voice echoed in Edu's head along with Kula's. \"The time of need has come.\" Seeing this creature for himself gave meaning to the warning.\nMore writhing tendrils slithered from the crystalline body. Edu's heart raced and his bowels emptied. He looked around, but there was nowhere to run. Too young to vie for a bride, Edu had never fought before, only jousts and sparring with his brothers and cousins. Red beams filled the air again, passing through him harmlessly. The demon rotated its top, tendrils waving frantically. Edu decided he would fight. He would not fight for the fallen men, but for his herd and the message he carried for the Black Orophant.\nThe demon lifted its front leg menacingly. Not waiting for an attack, not thinking, Edu rushed down the hill. His tusk hit the crystal body with a scraping sound. I'm too young to have a broken tusk, he thought.\nThe raised arm's sharp tip sliced his side. Pain spread across his skin like dried cracking mud worn too long.\nEdu backed up and charged again. His forehead hit solid crystal and his vision blurred. Sliding his head down the demon's angled side, his tusk found the opening where its leg protruded from its body. Edu pushed and his tusk pierced something soft.\nThe demon scuttled back and raised another leg. Knowing the sharp leg tips would find him, Edu charged but stopped just before impact. As the demon raked him, Edu snaked his trunk around its back leg and pulled. The thing toppled. Tendrils flayed madly, and red fire sprayed in a frightening but harmless display. Edu's tusk found the soft spot again. He jerked his head harder, this time ripping something. As Edu stomped on the fallen thing, the last tendril sputtered red sparks and slumped to the ground. Heart racing, Edu shuffled away.\nAn hour later, Edu moved into the outskirts of the circle of big males guarding the herd. Comforted by the closeness of so many elephants, many his uncles and cousins, he allowed himself to trumpet a wailing cry.\nHis young cousins followed in a line as he passed the young, the old, and his many aunts on his way to see Kula, the herd's matriarch. Kula stood tall and regal, surrounded by old wise females. She watched him approach, her eyes bright and alert.\nEdu grunted and traced patterns in the air with his tusks which meant, \"The Black Orophant has appeared. I bring his message to the herd.\"\nMore elephants gathered round. Edu's aunt Zheve touched her trunk to the scrapes in his side.\n\"Edu, is this true? There is no time for foolishness,\" the old matriarch said.\n\"I saw him myself,\" Edu responded. \"I promised I would tell the herds and Azilba of the Lions that he is here and that Phoenix is coming.\"\n\"This is the Black Orophant's message? Azilba is just a tale to scare young elephants so they will not stray when lions are about.\"\nBefore Edu could answer, a big male sounded a warning call. Edu's young cousins moved close to their aunts' sides. Even they could smell lions on the wind.\nBellies low to the ground, a dozen lions crawled down the hill Edu had passed only moments earlier. The big males trumpeted again, asking for instruction from their matriarch. Old Kula's eyes looked to the sky, as she did when contemplating where to graze next or the proper time to visit the graveyards.\n\"Let the lions come,\" Kula responded.\nThe males trumpeted again, this time in protest.\n\"Let the lions come to me.\"\nThe big males parted, opening an unobstructed path to Kula. The lions cautiously entered the circle, heads moving back and forth, watchful eyes scanning elephant feet and the fascinated faces of the tusk-less little ones.\nA lioness strained her head up to look into Kula's eyes.\n\"Azilba, Lord of Lions, wishes your permission to speak with the herds of the Black Orophant,\" she said, a guttural sound rolling from her throat.\n\"How is it that I can understand you? Elephants can not speak with lions.\"\n\"It is the hour of need,\" the lioness responded. \"Times are strange; strange things gather behind the barrier wall, and Azilba has returned to us.\"\nHigh on the monolithic, gray barrier wall, Edu watched a spider thing wave its tentacles and scuttle away.\n\"If Azilba is real, I will see her,\" Kula said.\nThe lioness roared and as if on cue hundreds of lionesses crested the hill.\nOne big cat stood in front the rest, golden fur glowing in the hot orange sun.\nWalking unguarded and holding her belly high, the big cat strode into the circle of elephants.\n\"Azilba,\" the lioness proclaimed. She and the other lionesses backed up and stood side by side with the encircling elephants as Azilba approached.\nAzilba, tall as a zebra, humbly stopped before Kula. Her eyes met Edu's.\n\"This little one is brave and a great benefit to your herd,\" Azilba said, gesturing to Edu with her head. \"I watched him kill a demon unaided.\"\n\"You know of these things?\" Kula asked.\nAzilba turned her head to the barrier wall. Kula looked just in time to see another spidery form disappear over the wall.\n\"They come from the fires falling from in the sky. The world outside the barrier wall has changed. They hunt the last of men, as men once hunted us.\"\n\"How can a lion know this?\" Kula asked.\n\"I am more than lion just as the Black Orophant is more than elephant.\"\nThis seemed to satisfy Kula, but not Edu.\n\"Isn't the enemy of men our friend?\" Edu asked.\n\"You are brave,\" Azilba said, \"but remember you are little and the world is big. Since the building of the barrier wall, men have let the herds and the prides flourish in peace. They were close to fulfilling their duty as caretakers.\"\nKula glanced sternly at Edu.\n\"His reluctance is important to address,\" Azilba continued. \"The barrier wall encloses much of the land that was once called Africa by the men. Outside men once lived in homes they called cities.\" She nodded to a shimmering area of air high above the trees.\n\"There, that is where the last of the cities will appear. It is a city called Phoenix from a place once known as Arizona. War with the demons reduced the world of men and their homes to rubble. With great effort, the men ripped one of their cities from the earth, and hid in time to escape destruction.\"\nEdu did not fully understand the meaning of 'time'. He knew he would grow tall and his tusks would lengthen and curve. That was time.\n\"Why do they fight? Surely they do not vie for each other's brides?\" Edu asked.\n\"I do not know how the war started, young one, but perhaps men roused the demons' anger. Perhaps the demons pursue the men for reasons that make no sense. Now it is only important how this will end.\"\n\"I still don't see why we should fight for them,\" Kula said.\n\"You remember much in the tales and stories you pass to your children. Would you have your children know men only in stories like the rhino and the leopard?\"\nKula shuffled in place. Edu recognized the thoughtful far away look in her eyes.\n\"You owe men nothing,\" Azilba said. \"But would you make the same mistakes as they almost did and stand idle in the face of a threat when you could render aid?\"\nKula squinted and looked at the shimmering air. \"How can this be? Men don't have wings. These cities don't just appear. Do they?\"\n\"The Black Orophant said I would see things that don't make sense,\" Edu said.\n\"The young one is right. What matters now is that the demons have come for the city. We must be ready to help the Black Orophant in the coming battle.\"\n\"The Black Orophant will fight for the men?\" Kula asked.\n\"The Black Orophant will fight, but more importantly he has something for the men of Phoenix. We fight so he may reach them.\" Azilba turned to Edu. \"You have seen the Orophant, young one. What did he tell you?\"\nThe herd, Kula, and the thirteen lions listened raptly. A shiver ran through Edu as he lifted his trunk to speak.\n\"The Black Orophant said tell the herds that he has returned. He is coming with an army of the great leaders of the herds of old.\"\nEdu looked at the silent and confused herd. His young cousin squeezed through two pairs of legs to get closer. He understood their confusion. When an elephant fell, they became bones and nothing more. He would not believe otherwise had he not seen the Black Orophant raising the fallen himself. Edu knew the herd wanted more, but he had no more to tell.\n\"What would the Black Orophant say now?\" Edu thought. He looked at Azilba. She seemed to know what he would say next.\n\"My herd,\" Edu trumpeted. \"The Black Orophant says not to fear.\"\nAzilba and the lions retreated to defensive positions in the low hills. She instructed Kula and the herds to do the same.\nAbove the trees, the shimmering air where Phoenix was to appear spat a bolt of blue electricity. It fizzled to the ground like lightning as the sky exploded into a cloud of blue sparks. Edu watched Kula flick her tail nervously and he felt afraid.\n\"It is Phoenix,\" Edu grunted. \"Just as Azilba told us.\"\nThe city of Phoenix, an island of rock and dirt, floated over the hills. A mass of buildings, tall silver shapes, crowded each other right to the edge. The overwhelming smell of exhaust and the waste of men wafted to the animals waiting below.\nAs if responding to a silent cue, the demons on the wall moved to attack. Hundreds of red beams of light raced to Phoenix but were absorbed by a shimmering blue cloud that surrounded the city at the last instant before they hit. Edu saw the city through the cloud, though hazily, like a reflection in water.\nA smaller cloud of sparking blue appeared on the barrier wall. Six bulky men emerged, almost identical to the ones Edu saw earlier except they were silver from head to toe.\nThe demons atop the wall attacked. Their red beams reflected off the silver men as they fired back. A spray of blue from a silver man's weapon hit a demon and for an instant it froze, then it moved backwards in a perfect mirror of its approach, before simply vanishing.\nHundreds of demons crowded the wall, surrounding the men holding them off with their strange showers of blue. Then one demon floated up, like a spiderling caught in the wind and began to drift towards Phoenix. Three more, then hundreds of the spidery things silently took to the air, floating slowly but steadily to the city. Bolts of blue arced from the floating piece of Arizona, pushing the attackers backward before they vanished.\n\"Phoenix's weapons send them back in time,\" Azilba said to Edu.\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\"Just lead the young ones away if the fighting gets too rough.\"\nEdu shuddered as another wave of demons took to the air. As the demons floated up, a crack spread across the wall beneath them. The crack opened into a fiery hole, collapsing the area where the silver men stood.\nSpider demons and men alike toppled and were crushed by rubble. As the dust began to settle, a giant shape emerged from the smoking hole. It resembled a spider demon, but ten times as large. Shiny protrusions jutted from its segmented body.\nExplosions tore more holes in the barrier wall and more giants crawled through. Azilba raced up and down the line of lions and elephants, calming and readying them. Edu feared they were too greatly outnumbered.\nA giant spider thing spat an orange fireball that streaked past the floating demons and penetrated the shimmering cloud around Phoenix. Dirt and rock rained upon the herd.\nEdu heard a growing rumble and a buzzing hum as a black cloud obscured the sun. The colored bolts flying back and forth glowed brighter in its shadow. The black cloud, a swarm of locusts, flew into the crossfire, protecting Phoenix by absorbing the demon's red blasts.\nThe locusts coated the floating demons and crawled into the soft places where their legs met their bodies. Demons dropped from the sky and crashed to the ground.\nAzilba's ears stood straight up. The rumbling shook the dry earth. A cloud of dust moved towards the battle.\n\"The Black Orophant, the Black Orophant has arrived!\" Edu cried. A line of gray elephants with the Black Orophant at their center stampeded towards the fight. Eyes black and trained forward, the Black Orophant's herd charged with no indication of fear or emotion Edu could see. He smelled nothing on the wind.\nAzilba roared, sending the prides and herds to join the Black Orophant's attack. Tusks gored and trunks swept slender legs. Lions jumped atop the giants and ripped whatever they could.\nThe demons shot red fire in all directions. A tusk-less one shuddered.\n\"Don't worry, their fire doesn't harm us,\" Edu said to him.\nThe fight erupted into a cry of snarls and trumpets as the red beams ripped into the lions and elephants. The tusk-less one next to Edu turned his head away.\n\"They burn us now,\" Edu thought as he gagged from the stink of flesh and locusts.\nEdu wanted to fight, but did as he was told and ran back to the hill to move the group of young ones away. Edu looked up at Phoenix and saw a silver craft emerge from a small cave in the floating rock. It sped to the ground like a hunting bird. The Black Orophant veered toward it, a swirling cloud of locusts surrounding him.\n\"Why is the Black Orophant running?\" Edu thought.\nThe Black Orophant stopped in Phoenix's shadow. Edu noticed a little man-child holding onto his back. The silver craft touched the ground and a door in its side slid open.\nA fireball raced across the plains and slammed into the Black Orophant, sending the man-child flying off his back. The Black Orophant fell to his knees and rolled on the flattened grass. The orange fire burned him, and did not extinguish no matter how he writhed.\nThe man-child flattened to the ground, avoiding beams of red fire. Without thinking, Edu ran towards him. Another fireball exploded somewhere nearby. Edu felt its heat on his side. In Phoenix's shadow, Edu lifted the boy with his trunk and placed him into the waiting arms of a silver man. With the boy safely in the man's arms, the door closed and the craft sped back to Phoenix.\nThe demons fired at the ship. Edu thought for a second it might fall from the sky. When it disappeared into the rocky cave, Edu turned to the Black Orophant. He smacked at the flames with his trunk but they still burned. Edu felt sick as he recognized the look of resignation in the Orophant's dark eyes.\n\"What can I do?\" Edu cried.\n\"What you were born to do,\" the Black Orophant answered, the flames running up his trunk.\n\"Who was the man-child?\" Edu asked.\n\"All animals have their prophecies and leaders; even men.\"\nThe blue sparking cloud around Phoenix changed to silver and then the city of Phoenix faded and vanished with a pop and hiss of rushing air, just as quickly as it had appeared. The Black Orophant trumpeted a powerful cry, a sound both dark and hopeful.\n\"They are gone now,\" the Orophant said. \"The last of men. The demons will go now.\"\nWith Phoenix gone the demons no longer fought. Edu thought they could have easily slaughtered the entire herd, but instead they crawled their way back to the breaches in the barrier wall.\nAzilba ran to Edu and watched as the flames consumed the Black Orophant.\n\"What will happen?\" Edu asked.\n\"The world will go on. With the men gone the demons will not return,\" Azilba said, with a mix of sadness and hope. She shook her head and turned to where the lions were licking their wounds.\nEdu watched the Black Orophant roll until he moved no more. Upon the Black Orophant's last twitch, the herd of reborn elephants lumbered away, the fury of their stampede gone. Their lack of an odor and dullness in their eyes still made Edu's spine tingle.\nEdu nudged the smoking mass that was the Orophant with his tusks.\n\"You are special, little one,\" he heard the Orophant say in his head.\nEdu heard another voice, and then another and another. Thousands of voices, the thoughts of all the elephant leaders echoed in his head. At that instant he knew that the Black Orophant could never die \u2013 that the Black Orophant was reborn in him and would be reborn in another should he fall.\nEdu felt himself growing larger and stronger. He knew Azilba was right.\nThe world would go on. It would be a world without men. A world of elephants and lions, living beyond the barrier wall.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Daniel Braum.

He'd been a fan of the good Doctor since he was 11 and had been keen to make his mark on the show, both by writing (he'd written four episodes) and through his script editing work. In the event, his time spent with Dr Who had left him disillusioned.\n'I was told: \"We want you, Douglas, because of the specific things you'll be able to bring to the programme,\" which I have been systematically not been allowed to do.\n'This season of Dr Who will look just like any other season \u2013 and I feel very disappointed about that.'\n'People always make this totally artificial distinction between what is commercial and what is good. They quote that maxim \"Nobody ever lost money underestimating the public's taste\" and I think that's very wrongheaded. I like to believe the audience is actually intelligent, because it's made up of other people like yourself.\n'People don't like to have their intelligence insulted. If you do something with sufficient enthusiasm and put enough into it, people are bound to respond, unless your judgement is totally cock-eyed.'\nAfter a lot of disappointments and false starts, Douglas had finally found his voice and his destiny when he stopped trying to follow other people's guidelines and started writing what he himself would have been surprised and delighted to find coming out of his radio.\n'I thought \"What would I really like to hear? What would excite me? Well, let's write it, because nobody else is doing anything that excites me, apart from the Pythons.\"\n'If The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes money, I shall enjoy that. But what I'll enjoy most is having proved that you don't have to underestimate people. I don't like the notion that you set yourself up as saying \"This is what people like, therefore this is what we'll do.\" That's patronizing.\n'I just want to kill the idea that you have to be bland to appeal to your market.'\n'I just want to kill the idea that you have to be bland to appeal to your market, though I know a lot of the BBC old guard still regard Hitchhiker's as a momentary aberration, a fluke, and not really what radio comedy ought to be about.\n'In the very first episode, while I was writing it, I kept thinking \"There ought to be a joke in here, because I've gone three pages without a joke.\" I knew I was trying to do something different, but you keep on looking for the odd thing you recognise.'\nDouglas explained the problem with conventional 'jokes' with an example from a scene in the first episode of the radio series, where Arthur Dent comes out with an obvious, punning gag line (Ford: 'How do you feel?' Arthur: 'Like a military academy \u2013 bits of me keep passing out.'). That won an immediate laugh from the cast and crew on the first take, but enthusiasm waned after the first few hearings.\nClick to hear a short segment of this interview. There was a far better joke elsewhere in the scene, and that took time to grow on people (Arthur: 'Where are we?' Ford: 'We're safe.' Arthur: 'Oh good.' Ford: 'We're in a small galley cabin in one of the spacecraft of a Vogon constructor fleet.' Arthur: 'Ah. This is obviously some strange meaning of the word \"safe\" that I wasn't previously aware of.') This is perfect Douglas Adams humour, rooted in language, character and the sheer control of tone and pacing that makes Hitchhiker's a genuine classic of modern literature.\nAt the time of this interview, Douglas had been juggling the day job with writing the first book, editing the first four 30-minute radio episodes to squeeze them onto four 22-minute sides of double LP record, developing ideas for the second radio series and trying to think about the TV version.\n'It's been a terrible tussle. All these different media demand the story goes in different directions \u2013 and this is getting me into all sorts of problems. When the second series is finished and in the can and I get down to the second book, the plot may actually diverge quite widely from one medium to another. At the moment, the radio show generates the material and then I sit down and try to write a book and make sense of the material.'\nAs Douglas Adams peered ahead in 1979 into the multimedia future he correctly foresaw for his work, he was probably the first major artist to take a full-on multi-channel approach. And he already had an acute sense of the different dynamics of these different media.\n'We're doing the telly next year, but I haven't got very far with that yet. We'll start serious thinking about how we're going to do it at the end of this year. It's very important that it looks as extraordinary as it sounded, and it mustn't look like Dr Who or Blake's Seven. All I have is a very vague visual sense about it, in the way that I started out with a vague audio sense about how Hitchhiker's should be. We've got to work that through.\n'And I think a film will have to be totally different again. Moving from radio to television, you can take most of the words with you. When you move on to the big screen, you have to start leaving some of the words behind and filling the gap visually, because film is primarily a visual medium. It becomes a different thing. I wasn't certain that could be done until I saw the stage show.\n'That was very different. It was fairly ramshackle, because it was put together on no budget at all, very, very fast. It was done by Ken Campbell who is totally wonderful. He's not interested in doing anything that's possible to do \u2013 the possible doesn't interest him. The show was 90 minutes long and based on three hours of material, so a lot of the words went, but it still worked. It was a totally different thing from the radio, but it worked very well. So it made me think \"We can do this on film.\"'\nIn fact, of course, the film version saw many false dawns before finally reaching the screen in 2005, four years after Douglas's untimely death. But his original vision of radio, books, records, TV and film, all built round carefully adapted and redeveloped versions of the Hitchhiker's saga, has largely come to pass. The opera and ballet versions are surely on their way, sooner or later.\nFor Douglas, the infinite possibilities and the practical difficulties of getting material written and meeting deadlines sat uncomfortably alongside each other.\n'Occasionally, I get a glimpse and think \"This can go on for ever.\" And then I get bogged down on the very next sentence.'\n'Occasionally, I get a glimpse and think \"This can go on for ever \u2013 it'll be terrific.\" And then I get bogged down on the very next sentence.\n'And when the idea comes, I often can't remember where it came from.

Its metallic fuselage bore scores of concave impressions, as if a vast mailed fist had hammered along its length, and it seemed to be falling. As it fell, in what appeared to be a listless way, dark incandescent red and orange colors limned its shape.\nThe man wore a tight-fitting yellow suit, the pockets of which he began to examine, taking out of them, one after another, a small notebook, a felt-tipped pen, some coins, a chain holding a number of keys and a wallet. He put the items on the bottom of the cube and appraised them, smiling now enigmatically. The beast approached the items, probing at them with its muzzle. It walked erratically, as if its legs were weak or injured. The man noticed this, and reached out to stroke its head. Then he opened the wallet and removed a series of photographs, arranging them in a row on the bottom of the cube.\nShaking his head, he seemed to begin to cry again, although there were no tears, just a grieved expression so great it seemed carved into his features.\nAfter a while, the man stood up and walked to one end of the cube, then back to the other end, touching its side tentatively, looking out. Space abounded with stars, stars that seemed to descend all around the two beings like a cosmic snowfall. The man watched them for a long time before lying down again, on his side, the beast moving to lie beside him.\nThey remained motionless for an hour or so, then the man stirred, got to his feet, and went to one end of the cube. He opened a compartment there, taking out half a dozen small packets that he put on the bottom of the cube through which thousands of distant stars shone. He tore open the top of one of the packets and poured some pellets of food into his palm, shaking more of them onto the bottom of the cube for the beast, which moved wobblingly toward them and devoured them hungrily.\nHe ate slowly, and when he was finished tossed the empty packet to the other end of the cube. He sat for a while, stroking the beast's head. Shortly the man rolled over and lay quietly, sleeping. The beast curled up beside him and followed his example. An hour later, the man sat up, glancing about as if bewildered by his surroundings. He stood up, and the beast stirred and also got to its feet. The man put his palms against the side of the cube and stared out with a longing expression, as if he discovered himself, to his dismay, inside a cage.\nThe cube moved through a sea of black space aglow with the white fire of stars visible through all of its surfaces, everywhere. Suddenly the man broke into a sort of impromptu promenading dance step, waving his arms, grinning, prancing about with the small beast following him waveringly at every motion and turn. He danced oddly and comically for half a minute. Then suddenly he collapsed, sinking to the bottom of the cube, where he arranged himself sitting in a crosslegged posture, his head pressed down into his hands.\nHis body very slightly convulsed in a series of spasms. He appeared to be sick, or crying again. He reached out with one hand for the beast, but his fingers groped uneventfully in the air. The beast had lain down and no longer moved, or even seemed to be breathing. Its mouth was open, its tongue extended, eyes rolled back in its head. The man crawled over to it, touching it tentatively again and again, then finally moved to the other end of the cube and huddled there, looking back at the beast, shaking his head.\nAfter a while, he stood up and began writing with the pen on one side of the cube. In the middle of the writing the pen stopped functioning and he threw it down, leaving an unfinished statement on the transparent surface, which seen from the outside looked like:\nThe man sat down again, staring out at the stars, expressionless. An hour passed during which he remained almost completely motionless, then he slowly stood up. He picked up the small beast delicately with both hands and carried it to a corner of the cube, opened another compartment there, slid out a drawer several feet long, put the little beast inside it and slid it back into place. He made an adjustment with an inconspicuous instrument and watched as the beast was drawn outside the cube into space, visible there for a split second, the momentary image immediately obscured by the familiar permanent sight of numberless bright stars.\nThe man walked to the other end of the cube, paced back again and continued to walk back and forth aimlessly; his head was inclined downwards as if to avert his gaze, but it confronted stars through the bottom of the cube. He ran his hand through his hair, absently at first, then in an increasingly uneasy manner.\nHe sat down and turned his attention to the stars. He watched them as intently as someone viewing a film or play. Intermittently he got up and paced around slowly for a minute or so before sitting down again and watching. The process continued for hours, with the man becoming virtually automaton-like in his behavior. Finally, he lay down and slept again.\nA few hours later, when he woke, he sat up with what seemed to be great effort. He did not get to his feet, but crawled over to the packets he had removed from the compartment. He tore another one of them open, shook a couple of capsules into his hand, then swallowed them, his mouth writhing as if from a bitter taste. Then he crawled over to the photographs and picked one of them up. He held it briefly to his heart, then touched it to his lips. With a weary and enigmatic smile he lay down on his side and closed his eyes.\nMinutes passed and he remained inert, his fingers having curled rigidly in a way that gave his hands the appearance of claws. Hours passed.\nMany more hours passed, and then another space craft came from the same direction as the one that had exploded. It was bullet-shaped, about fifteen times the size of the cube and, like the cube, was transparent.\nThe craft was a Life Finder and it approached the cube cautiously, moving with fine precision until the two craft were adjacent to each other. Inside the new arrival a mechanical creature moved about with care and deliberation. Soon, long flexible tendrils extruded from the craft to a length of two hundred meters and sinuously enveloped the cube. Inside the cube the man lay motionless. The appendages were tipped with discs which searched all about the surface of the cube, slowly in the manner of a stethoscope applied by a doctor. They held onto the cube for about ten minutes while the mechanical creature manipulated them gently. Then the tendrils were withdrawn.\nThe bullet receded slightly from the cube and suddenly a refulgent beam, blue as starlight, crackled from the bullet into the cube, which disintegrated, portions of it flying in all directions, parts of the cube and the man spinning off and away toward the omnipresent stars. In the same instant as the cube exploded the bullet accelerated in the direction from which it had come, vanishing almost immediately. Then nothing happened; the stars continued to display themselves in the vast theater of space, like myriad cold lights hung in an infinite tree of night.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Larry Tritten.

He'd been hearing the whoosh of air out of tires for a couple of minutes as he skulked through the gravel parking lot at Gold Lake, but this was a different kind of whistle. He turned his head slowly, expecting to see an orange-vested hunter at the edge of the tree line around the lake, but instead he saw a deer standing less than a dozen yards away, watching him with its head cocked slightly to the side in a caricature of curiosity. It was a buck, and king of the forest by the size of its antlers.\n\"Look, I'm trying to save your ass,\" Keith said. \"There's jerkoffs with guns all through the woods around here, and every one of them is looking for you.\"\nThat might change when they discovered what Keith had done to their vehicles, but he doubted if lack of transportation would keep a hunter from shooting a trophy buck.\nOr a goddamned hippie tree-hugger. He had tucked his shoulder-length hair into a stocking cap so it wouldn't get into his eyes when he bent over to knife a tire, and he had foregone his usual jeans and tie-dye in favor of camouflage pants and a dark green jacket, but that wouldn't help him if he were caught in the parking lot with a knife in his hand. His Volkswagen Beetle wore the camo that time and traffic had given it: rust, dents patched with reddish-brown body putty, and gray mud from the two miles of dirt road between the highway and the lake, but that wouldn't help either. He might as well have been wearing neon and driving a cop car. Out here among the rednecks, a person like him stood out like a snowball in a coal mine.\nIt was a risk he was willing to take. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife had stubbornly refused to close this section of the Willamette National Forest to hunting despite the steady decline in the deer population over the last five years. They said hunting was still a necessary management tool for culling the herd, even in times of \"temporary decline in numbers.\" That was pure bullshit, a sop to the gun nuts in the rural congressional districts, but after a decade spent fighting the federal government over land use issues, Keith was used to that kind of thing. If they wouldn't protect the wildlife, then it was up to people like him to do what they could on their own.\nBut a guy could only do so much. The deer needed at least a little survival instinct.\n\"Shoo!\" he said, waving his arms at the buck. \"Run away!\"\nThe deer whistled again. It wasn't just the single-pitched exhalation that deer make when they're alarmed; this was a complex blend of tones like a bird song.\n\"Whoa,\" Keith said. \"I didn't know you guys could do that.\"\nThe sharp crack of a rifle shot echoed off the ridge to the east. Keith flinched and nearly dropped his knife before he realized that the shot had been too far away to be someone shooting at him.\nBut if they weren't shooting at him, then they were shooting at a deer. \"Shit!\" he hissed, whirling around and jabbing the blade into the side of the Winnebago. It only went in an inch or so, not nearly enough to quench his anger, so he scratched the word \"asshole!\" in ragged letters in the off-white painted tin. There was another shot. That would be the coup de grace. He turned toward the deer in the parking lot and hissed, \"Scat! Go! Hide!\" He rushed it, brandishing the knife.\nIt stood its ground for a second. Not until he scooped up a fistful of gravel from the parking lot and flung it at the animal's auburn flank did it turn and prance away on its thin, graceful legs. It whistled again, and its antlers wiggled as if they were loose. No, Keith decided as he watched it move away, they didn't look loose. They looked jointed, like the legs of an insect.\n\"Holy shit,\" he whispered. This was some kind of serious mutant. He started after it, calling out, \"Hey, wait a minute!\" but it easily outdistanced him and disappeared into the forest.\nHe looked back at the dozen pickups, SUVs, and campers in the parking lot, all hunkered low on flat tires. He would love to go after the strange deer, but he couldn't afford to be caught here.\nHe walked back to his Volkswagen, started it up, and put it in gear. He thought he heard more shots over the noise of the engine, but he couldn't tell for sure. It didn't matter; he'd done all he could. He drove back to the highway, bouncing over the rutted road in first and second gear the whole way. When he reached the pavement he turned downhill, toward Oakridge and beyond it, Eugene. His heart rate slowed down now that he was on the highway, but he couldn't hide his manic grin. Score one for animal rights.\nBut his mind kept returning to the deer he'd seen. He didn't know every species of animal in the woods, but he knew there'd never been anything like that here before. Or anywhere else.\nThe hunter's name was Jimmy, and that was the kind of pickup he drove, a diesel club cab with a full-bed camper on back and a trailer for his all-terrain vehicle behind. He had parked it sideways in the gravel parking lot so he'd be able to spot deer at the edge of the woods from his bed in the morning. It took up about five spaces that way, but that was okay with him. The fewer people could park there, the less competition he'd have.\nOnce he'd set up camp, he'd offloaded his 4-wheeler and driven into the woods, steering one-handed while he drank his first beer of the day. He was savoring the idea of a whole week away from his wife and kids, anticipating a good roaring drunk every night, and telling himself that this would be the year he bagged himself a trophy buck.\nWhen the five-point blacktail strolled out in front of him, he figured he was the luckiest guy on the mountain. He didn't even have to get off his ATV. He just stopped, unslung his .270 off his back, and took aim, bracing his left elbow on the gas tank. One quick shot through the heart and the deer dropped like a sack of rocks.\nHe felt a moment's disappointment at the realization that the hunt was over so soon, but he wasn't about to complain. He'd gone three years without even seeing a deer. The damn Californicators who came up to hunt in the Cascades were picking the forest clean.\nBut not quite. He'd finally got his buck, and a damned fine one, too. He slid off his ATV and walked over to it. The deer was still quivering. Probably just nerves, he figured, but when he knelt down beside its head to get a closer look at its rack, he got a nasty surprise. The deer whistled like a half a dozen tea kettles all boiling at once, jerked its head back, and rammed its antlers into his crotch and stomach.\n\"Son of a bitch!\" he yelled, leaping back and firing a round directly into the side of its head. Blood and bone exploded out the backside, but he didn't care. Screw the trophy; that hurt.\nThen he felt the trickle of warmth on the inside of his right leg and knew he was in trouble. He looked down, hoping for the first time in his life that he'd just pissed his pants, but the deep red blood gushing out through the hole in the faded blue denim told him the deer had hit a major artery.\nWincing at the pain, he immediately clapped his left hand over the hole and pushed, but he knew it was a futile gesture. He'd heard stories about guys who'd stabbed themselves in the femoral artery while they were gutting an animal, and they'd bled to death within minutes.\nHe looked over at his ATV. There was no way he could drive it back to camp. With his legs spread apart to straddle the gas tank, he'd never be able to stop the bleeding. Not that he was doing such a great job as it was. Hot red blood oozed around his fingers, dripping down his pantleg in a steady stream. He spent a half a minute trying to pinch the artery closed above the wound, but it was too deep under the muscle.\nThere was only one thing to do. He held his rifle into the air and fired three quick shots, then reloaded and fired three more. If anyone was nearby, they would know someone was in trouble.\nHe fumbled in his pocket with blood-slick fingers for more bullets, refilled the magazine, then lay back against the now-still deer and gripped his leg as tight as he could. Damn, that hurt.\nHe looked over at the antlers that had gored him, and was surprised to see them curling up like fingers. The joints were maybe three inches apart, except near the tips, which were only an inch or so long and forked. They clacked open and closed like crabs' claws.\nHe had to be hallucinating. Deer antlers didn't do that. He fired three more shots, then reloaded again. A few minutes later he fired three more. His vision started to swirl, and he heard a rushing sound in his ears like wind in the trees, so he squeezed off his last two rounds while he could still do it, then he laid his head against the deer's soft hide and waited for the pain to stop.\nKeith read about the dead hunter in the Register-Guard the next morning. It made the front page, and there was another front-page story in the City\/Region section about the strange mutant deer that they'd found next to the body. The Fish and Wildlife people said they'd never seen anything like it.\nThere wasn't a single mention of the green guerrilla action in the parking lot, but that was all right by Keith. He hadn't done it for the notoriety. As long as word spread among the hunters that they were liable to lose tires around Gold Lake, that was all he cared about.\nBut the new deer; that was something. The wildlife biologist said it was a sport, a one-of-a-kind mutation that was unlikely to show up again, but Keith knew better than that. He had seen one just like it in the parking lot at the same time the redneck was getting himself killed a mile up the trail.\nHe wasn't sure what to think about that. If the ecosystem had gotten so screwed up that deer were mutating, then things were much worse than he had thought. On the other hand, if this was a viable new species, it could be an incredible boon for the environmental movement. The Endangered Species Act didn't say anything about treating new species any different from old ones; once the word got out, there would have to be a study to find out what this one's habitat was and how it could be protected. That meant an immediate moritorium on logging, and it might even mean a ban on motorized vehicles in the area.\nIt took him half an hour to get through to the Sierra Club's local office, but when he did, the woman on the phone was overjoyed at the news. Her name was Pamela, and she turned out to be the chapter's vice-president. Any excuse for a logging ban was fine with her. Within an hour the two of them were on the road back to Gold Lake, cameras and recording gear piled into the back of her Datsun pickup.\nWhen they got to the turnoff, they found a police barricade across the road. The cop refused to let them by, even when Pamela threatened to bring the wrath of the entire Sierra Club down on his department. Keith kept his mouth shut, nervously worrying that some little detail would give him away as the parking lot saboteur, but when Pamela started to get out of the car he reached across in front of her and held the door closed, saying, \"Wait a minute. All we want to do is look for more mutated deer. If there's a bazillion cops and reporters and stuff at Gold Lake, there won't be any deer there anyway. They'll all be hiding out a ridge or two away.\"\nThe cop nodded eagerly. \"He's right about that. There's Fish and Wildlife guys all over the mountain back there, and they haven't seen a squirrel, much less a deer.\" He leaned a little closer so he could talk straight to Keith and said, \"If I was you, I'd try the Pengra Pass trail just on the other side of the highway. That's all wilderness area over there. No vehicles, and a lot fewer people. If I was a deer, that's where I'd be today.\"\n\"In your professional opinion,\" Pamela said sarcastically.\nHe lost his smile. \"Lady, it may be hard for you to believe, but I'd be plumb happy if you found a new species of deer up here. That'd close down hunting for at least a couple of years, and the fewer idiots we get up here with guns, the easier that makes my job.\"\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"All right, then, we'll try Pengra Pass.\" She put the pickup into reverse and jockeyed it around, then drove across the road to the trailhead. \"It's funny,\" she said to Keith as they strapped on the cameras and tape recorders, \"You get so used to guys in uniform being such total jerks, it's always a surprise when they turn out to be human.\"\n\"Kind of spoils a good stereotype, doesn't it?\" He checked to make sure he'd put his water bottle and picnic lunch in his day pack, slung that over his shoulders, and started up the trail.\nPamela was short and wiry, but she was a good hiker. They put a couple miles behind them in the first hour, crossing the Union Pacific railroad tracks and heading deep into the wilderness area. Of course this was an Oregon wilderness area, reserved for non-commercial use after the old growth forest had been logged, but the replanted Douglas Fir was at least thirty feet tall already and there were even a few volunteer pines on the south-facing slopes. Rhododendron and blackberry choked the understory, but as long as Keith and Pamela stayed to the trail, it was easy going.\nThey followed the Pacific Crest trail over the pass, then stopped for lunch in a little clearing with a good view of the valley to the south. Pamela was a food bar and bottled juice person, Keith noted as he unpacked his orange, apple, and ziplock bag full of homemade gorp.\n\"Are those M&Ms?\" she asked when he offered her some.\n\"Yep. M&Ms, cashews, and raisins. Best trail mix you can get.\"\n\"M&Ms?\" she asked again, and she pulled her hand away from the bag as if they were some kind of controlled substance.\n\"Suit yourself,\" he said, taking another handful.\nThe air whispered softly through the treetops while they ate. Keith was self-consciously aware of the crunching sound the nuts made, and the apple after that. Pamela ate one granola bar and had a sip of juice, then scanned the forest with binoculars while she waited for him to finish.\nHe was just nibbling the last of his apple when he heard a multi-tone whistle from the trees off to their right. \"That's it,\" he whispered. \"That's the sound they make.\"\n\"You sure it's not a bird?\"\n\"I'm sure.\" He whistled a few random notes in response, then remembered the recorder slung around his chest and turned it on.\nThe whistle sounded closer, and a minute later a deer stepped out into the clearing. Pamela snapped a picture of it with her still camera, then turned on her video camera and filmed it as it walked slowly toward them.\n\"Hey, you want an apple core?\" Keith said, holding it out toward the deer.\n\"Don't feed wild animals!\" Pamela hissed at him.\n\"It doesn't seem very wild,\" Keith said. The deer was being cautious, but it advanced steadily toward them, one step at a time, until it stood just a few feet away. Its eyes were wide and brown, its hair was reddish ochre, and its tail flicked at flies just like a normal deer's, but its antlers were in constant motion and it kept whistling with a melodic voice unlike any wild animal they had ever heard.\nThe video camera whirred as Pamela zoomed in. \"Holy shit,\" she whispered, \"that's not just a mutation. This is a totally different kind of animal.\"\nThat would certainly explain a few things, but Keith still wasn't convinced. \"If it's a different kind of animal, why does it look so much like a deer?\" he asked.\n\"Why do crocodiles look like alligators?\" she replied. \"Parallel evolution. Certain shapes fit certain biological niches.\"\n\"But where'd it come from?\" he asked. \"And how did it get here?\"\n\"I don't know. Maybe it hitched a ride on a UFO or something.\"\n\"UFO?\" Keith hadn't been thinking in those terms, but now that she had broached the subject, he had to admit it made about as much sense as anything else.\nHe looked at its antlers. When it stretched them out, they extended well past its nose, clearly capable of grasping things and holding them in front of its eyes and mouth. In fact, they looked like they would be just as good as hands at manipulating things. \"Maybe it's the pilot of a UFO,\" he said. \"Hey, do you understand English?\"\nIt whistled a two-tone rising note.\n\"Parlez-vous Francais? Habla Espanol? Sprechen sie Deutsch?\"\nIt made the same song again.\n\"Negative on the Western languages,\" Pamela said. \"Vi gavaretye pa-Rooskie?\" It didn't respond, and she laughed nervously. \"Well, that's a relief.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe deer whistled again, then lowered its head and started eating one of the Oregon grape bushes near their feet. Pamela filmed it, and Keith tried again to talk to it, but it had apparently lost interest in them. After a few minutes it moved away, casually munching grass and bushes until they got up to follow it, whereupon it flicked its tail at them and darted away into the forest.\n\"That was too strange,\" Pamela said, lowering her camera.\n\"Look at that bush,\" Keith said. The Oregon grape had been chewed right down to the ground, branches and all.\nTheir film made the evening news that night, and Keith was busy for a few days giving interviews, but his time in the spotlight diminished a bit when the Fish and Wildlife department announced their findings.\nEarth had been invaded.\nThere was no question that the deer were alien. The first autopsy confirmed it beyond a doubt. The similarities to normal deer persisted in organs like lungs and kidneys, but the heart and digestive system didn't look like anything Earthly, and it had extra organs that the biologists couldn't identify. They couldn't have all been spontaneous mutations, and besides, the antlers were fully innervated and supplied with musculature and a blood supply to match--the result of millennia of evolution, not a random sport.\nIts brain wasn't divided into hemispheres like a mammal's, either, but its complexity rivaled the human brain, and observations in the wild left little doubt that the new deer were intelligent. Theirs seemed a different sort of intelligence than human. They communicated among themselves, and they showed a certain degree of curiosity about people, but they didn't seem interested in learning to talk with researchers, and despite their articulated antlers, they displayed no technical skills whatsoever. They used their grasping ability to hold branches while they stripped them of leaves, and occasionally one of the creatures would scratch another one's side, but that was about the extent of it.\nTheories about their origin abounded. They had slipped through from an alternate dimension, or they were alien livestock that got away during an emergency UFO landing, or they were colonists who had paid for passage to Earth. Among people who believed the latter, arguments raged about whether they were willing immigrants, transported criminals, or stranded explorers, but there wasn't enough evidence to answer that question. Researchers watched them in action, but aside from their vocal communication with one another, they behaved more like deer than like anything else. That seemed to surprise all the scientists, but Keith saw no reason why intelligent creatures had to live in cities and drive cars. If these guys had evolved in the woods on their homeworld, why wouldn't they want to live there on Earth?\n\"They're like starlings,\" he told a reporter a few months later. \"They aren't native here, but when they were introduced into a new environment, they thrived.\"\n\"How so?\" the reporter asked. She had displayed a fair knowledge of ecology before the interview started; this was obviously a leading question, giving Keith the opportunity to elaborate.\n\"They're taking over the ecological niche that used to belong to deer,\" he said. \"The deer population has been dropping for the last five years or so, probably from competition for food. And these new guys probably don't have the same natural enemies as deer. Cougars might get one now and then, but I'd be surprised if they came down with any of the normal deer diseases, and that's what really keeps a population in check.\"\n\"Do you think they'll expand all across America the way starlings have?\" asked the reporter.\nKeith shrugged. \"Who knows? Deer are one of the few large-animal species that seem to thrive alongside humanity. If these guys really fill the same niche, then they might, too.\"\nThe reporter leaned forward. \"Just how far do you mean that? If they fill the same niche, should people be allowed to hunt them like deer?\"\n\"People shouldn't be allowed to hunt deer,\" Keith replied. \"It's a barbaric custom, a holdover from an age that no longer exists.\"\nHe got hate mail for that, and even a death threat scribbled in red felt pen on the back of a gun catalog. He thought about reporting it to the FBI, but after his heartbeat returned to normal he realized he was more amused than afraid, so he framed it and put it on his wall.\nHe dropped out of the news before long anyway. The whole subject did. For an alien invasion, this one was pretty tame, and apart from the occasional scientific update, there was little to report.\nKeith kept up on the subject as best he could. His off-the-cuff remark about cougars proved wrong: not even the biggest cats could take down an alien. The adults were too watchful for a cougar to get the drop on them, and too good with their horns for one to win a straightforward fight. Fawns were more vulnerable, but the parents would band together and charge anything that looked threatening, chasing it not just away from their offspring, but completely out of their territory.\nAnd that territory expanded relentlessly. Biologists discovered that the alien deer bore two fawns a year, which reached maturity in time to bear fawns of their own by the following spring. Without natural enemies, they spread all the way up and down the Cascades from California well into Canada with no sign of slowing down. They ate practically anything, and as their numbers grew they ate practically everything. Woods that had once been choked with blackberry were now clear from the ground to the forest canopy.\nAt first, Keith was cautiously optimistic. Blackberry was an interloper itself, after all, brought westward by settlers who didn't know or didn't care what it would do to the local ecology when it got loose from their gardens. But the aliens also ate the rhododendrons, Oregon grape, currants, lupine, and every tender shoot of new growth they could reach on the aspens. By the third summer after their discovery, a hiker could see off the trail a hundred yards without spotting anything green on the ground, and the real deer were starving to death.\nForest Service biologists tried to talk to the aliens. Fish and Wildlife ecologists tried to talk to them. Astronomers from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence tried to talk to them, but nobody had any luck. The aliens weren't interested in talking back, at least not to humans, and without any referents to go on, nobody could crack their language simply from recordings.\nKeith could have told them they were wasting their time. He'd had plenty of experience trying to talk to people with different ideas of how the forest ought to be used, and the first thing he'd learned about them was that nobody listened to words. Only actions spoke. And if somebody didn't act soon, the Willamette National Forest was going to look like the Sahara.\nThe Winnebago still had a rusty message scratched into its side: Asshole! Keith winced when he pulled his Volkswagen up next to it, but he parked the car anyway and got out. That was a long time ago. In many ways it was a lifetime ago.\nThe owner of the Winnebago stepped out, rifle in hand. He was a tall, overweight man with a John Deere cap on his head and a one-piece orange coverall everywhere else, and he sized up Keith through narrow little pig-like eyes. Keith had foregone the tie-dye this time, but he still wore his hair in a ponytail, and beneath his orange plastic vest his jacket was one of those yuppie gray polarfleece things. He didn't say a word, just tilted the driver's seat forward and reached into the back for the 30.06 he'd bought from his death-threat catalog.\nHe straightened back up, rifle in hand. \"Need somebody to watch your back?\" he asked.\nThe hunter thought about it for a moment, then nodded. \"Might not be a bad idea. I hear these alien bastards can gang up on a guy.\"\n\"So I've heard.\"\nThe hunter smiled, revealing tobacco-stained teeth, then leaned sideways and spit on the gravel. \"All right, then. Let's go get us some Venuson.\" He lifted his rifle in the air like a marine crossing a river.\nKeith's heart was pounding a mile a minute. The gun felt more alien to him than the creatures overrunning the woods around him, but he held it over his head just like his newfound hunting buddy, and he managed to smile as he said, \"Fuckin' A, Bubba.

We have to consider distance. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is about 100,000 light years across. We are about 28,000 light years from the centre. That means if life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, it could be on a world up to 78,000 light years distant. Even the nearest star to us (other than our Sun) is over 4 light years away, and there are only about a dozen or so within ten light years.\nAny signal we send out to an alien civilisation will be limited by the speed of light, so even if we got lucky and found life existing on a near neighbour we would still be waiting years to get a reply to each communication. Each answer would be received by the next generation from the one asking the question (or maybe several generations further down the line).\nFaster Than Light?\nHow could we speed this up a bit? And could we even make the trip there to meet them? To make interstellar communications and travel possible we need to be able to send messages (or ourselves) across these vast distances in considerably less time that it takes for light or conventional radio waves to make the journey.\nWhen Einstein published his theory of Special Relativity in 1905, contrary to a popular misconception about his theory, he did not state that travel faster than light is impossible. However, his theory included the following equation:\n(E is energy, m is mass, v is velocity and c stands for the speed of light. This is the equation more commonly represented as E=mc2, simplified for objects at rest, velocity being zero.)\nAs velocity approaches the speed of light the lower half of this equation tends to zero, and the energy requirement tends towards infinity. This means that accelerating to speeds greater than light using conventional means would require more than infinite energy, and hence it is not possible to accelerate from less than to greater than light speed.\nHence, we would need to find a mechanism to allow the distances to be covered in less time than light would travel in a direct line between the two points without actually exceeding the speed of light locally to the traveller, or the message.\nScience Fiction has two popular ways of achieving this - Warp Drive and Wormholes. But are these methods actually feasible?\nWarp Drive\nIn 1994 Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre decided to investigate if a Star Trek type Warp Drive could be created, achieving superluminal speeds (faster than light) without breaking the rules of relativity. His starting point was the curving of space caused by gravity. He postulated that if you distort spacetime by greatly extending it behind the spacecraft whilst simultaneously contracting it in front of the craft, then the craft itself could travel inside this region of distorted space at sub-light speeds whilst achieving superluminal speeds when compared to objects in normal space.\nThis warp \"bubble\" would shield the craft and its occupants from the effects of the massive acceleration and deceleration of the journey, and would mean that the travellers would not experience time dilation effects. The downside of this method is it requires the use of Exotic Matter \u2013 matter with a negative energy density. Physicists are not convinced this matter even exists \u2013 the laws of quantum physics suggest it might, but no proof has yet been found. Even if it does exist, it might not be possible to collect enough to build a working Warp Drive.\nWormholes\nWormholes are a well-known and frequently proposed mechanism for achieving FTL travel. Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen were the first to describe wormholes in 1935 (they were originally known as Einstein-Rosen bridges). Physicist John Wheeler would coin the term \"wormhole\" in 1955 (and would also invent the terms \"black hole\" and \"quantum foam\").\nThe concept can be described simply. If you imagine the universe as the skin of an apple, then to get from a point on the surface to a second point on the far side we would have to travel around the edge. However, if we were to burrow through the apple just like a worm might, then we get there much more quickly.\nIf we could burrow in this way through the spacetime of the universe then we could move at sub-light speeds directly through the tunnel crossing the distance in a far shorter time than light travelling in regular space could manage.\nWe would have achieved our objective without having to break that pesky light-speed barrier. But exactly how could a wormhole be opened?\nMichael Morris, Kip Thorne, and Uri Yertsever working at the California Institute of Technology published a paper in 1987 describing Traversable Wormholes.\nSpace has an underlying energy, known as Vacuum Energy, even when it appears totally empty of matter: the empty space of a vacuum is not actually empty if you look at it at the quantum level. Even in a total vacuum, Virtual Particles are continually being created, always as particle\/antiparticle pairs, living brief lives and then mutually annihilating each other. These Virtual Particles are also known as Vacuum Fluctuations in the Vacuum Energy.\nAs well as these Virtual Particles a vacuum is teeming with violent but incredibly small-scale fluctuations in space-time itself, ultra-small wormholes that are continually being created and destroyed in an instant.\nHowever these wormholes could be kept stabilised by using exotic matter to keep their entrances open. Exotic matter exerts a negative pressure \u2013 if you were to attempt to inflate a balloon using exotic matter you would find that the more you pumped into the balloon the less inflated it would become. If you were to thread the entrance of a wormhole with such material, then this negative pressure would prevent the mouth's collapse.\nOnce stabilised it may be possible to move these entrances across vast areas whilst maintaining their link. The initial trip would, by necessity, need to be made at normal velocities, but once the entrances were installed at their respective destinationis we could then have FTL communication and possibly travel through this wormhole. The theory does allow for the entrances to be expanded to the macroscopic by adding energy.\nHowever there is a hurdle to overcome with this method, aside from discovering these tiny wormhole entrances. The force required to keep the entrance open is huge. So great, in fact, that it may well tear apart anything trying to pass through the wormhole.\nBut they may provide a useful means of communicating with a ship moving at Subluminal speeds (slower than light) away from Earth.\nIs the Speed of Light Constant?\nThere are other possibilities that might help us. We could make light travel faster, and so be able to achieve greater velocities without having to travel FTL. This sounds a little like Scotty's famous line on Star Trek about the laws of physics, but it could be possible.\nVacuum Fluctuations fill (in a virtual sense) a vacuum, with particle\/anti-particle pairs continuously being created and annihilated. If a photon strikes these pairs it is absorbed, to be re-emitted when the pair self-destructs. This slows down the photon.\nIn 1990 Klaus Scharnhorst of the Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin in East Germany and Gabriel Barton of the University of Sussex, working independently, explored what would happen to photons travelling perpendicularly to two parallel plates placed extremely close together (roughly one micrometer of separation) in a vacuum.\nThis degree of separation is less than the wavelengths of some of the Virtual Particles and so lowers the density of the Virtual Particles in the vacuum. This lowering of Vacuum Energy results in the photon being less likely to encounter Virtual Particles and therefore being able to travel faster than our accepted speed of light. This phenomenon has been called the Scharnhorst Effect.\nThis is on an incredibly small scale, but if we could expand the range and effect of this we could be able to travel faster than light outside the local area of effect whilst not actually breaking the restrictions imposed by relativity.\nQuantum Entanglement\nQuantum Theory allows for two particles to interact, such that the quantum states of the particles are joined forming a single entangled state. This results in the two particles being not completely independent of the other, so that affecting one of the entangled pair would produce a result in the other. This would occur irrespective of the extent of spatial separation between the two particles.\nSo could these entangled particles be used for superluminal communications? To achieve this we would need to create two or more identical (or cloned) particles and then separate them physically from each other. Then if we were to act on one of the particles, an observer of the second should be able to detect an effect. Then introducing a code (such as Morse Code) would mean we should be able to communicate at greater than the speed of light.\nSuch a thing is unfortunately impossible. In 1982 physicists Bill Wootters, Wojciech H. Zurek and Dennis Dieks introduced the No Cloning Theorem. This theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. As cloning is a requirement of using these entangled particles for superluminal communication, we have to rule this method out.\nTachyons\nRelativity might state that we cannot accelerate from sub-light speeds to super-light speeds, but it does not explicitly forbid the existence of particles travelling faster than light. Tachyons are theoretical particles that travel at speeds greater than light, but are not capable of slowing to below light-speed (the barrier operates in both directions).\nIf such particles exist (and there is some doubt amongst physicists) then could they be used to transmit messages? The problem would be how to detect them, and how then to affect them in such a way as to send our message.\nIn 1934 Pavel Cherenkov was investigating the effects of radiation in liquids. Light travels through water at a speed far less than it does in a vacuum. This means that it is possible for a particle to travel through water at speeds greater than that of light in the same medium. Cherenkov noticed that when a charged particle does exceed the speed of light in this medium, the water glowed blue. This effect is known as Cherenkov Radiation.\nIf there are charged Tachyons moving through the vacuum we should be able to detect this Cherenkov Radiation. So far no such Tachyons have been discovered, and many physicists doubt their existence.\nFrom the subluminal perspective, fast moving charged particles interacting with other particles would lose energy and slow down. For charged Tachyons these interactions would also cause them to lose energy. The problem for charges Tachyons is that relativity states that moving closer to the speed of light requires more and more energy.\nHence, if tachyons move faster than the speed of light, losing energy would cause them to accelerate, resulting in more and more collisions and a runaway reaction of speed increase and energy loss until the Tachyon would have infinite velocity. So we must assume that if Tachyons exist then they cannot be electrically charged.\nIf we assume Tachyons do exist and that we can control them, could we use them to transmit messages faster than light? To do this we would need to encode the message on a localised Tachyon field, one confined to a definable region of spacetime. Once encoded we can then transmit this field to its intended recipient. However, there is a problem with this.\nRelativistic quantum mechanics examines the wave properties of Tachyons by means of the Klein-Gordon equation, a relativistic method of describing particles. There are two possible solutions to this equation for Tachyon disturbances.\nThe first has the particles' momentum being lower than their energy. This solution states that the disturbances are localised, but also that they are propagated at speeds less than that of light. The second solution, with energy exceeding momentum, does indeed produce waves at superluminal velocities. The problem however is that we cannot localise the wave, which would mean we cannot use the wave to transmit a message.\nSo, even if Tachyons do exist, they do not seem to present us with a method of faster-than-light communication.\nUnfortunately, with our current knowledge of physics, if we want to get to another solar system it will take a long, long time. On January 23rd 2006 NASA's New Horizons Space Mission was launched. This is speeding towards Pluto at 58,000 kilometres per hour. Even using a slingshot from Jupiter to gain more speed this probe will not arrive at Pluto until 2015.\nPluto is about 4.28 billion kilometres form Earth at its closest. The nearest star other then our Sun is Proxima Centauri at over 40 trillion kilometres. It takes light 4.2 years to cross the distance between the solar systems. If New Horizons had been aimed at Proxima Centauri it would not arrive for thousands of years.\nBut science has been advancing at ever increasing rates. It's only just over a hundred years since the Wright Brothers built the first craft capable of flight, and we have already landed men on the moon and sent probes to the other seven planets in our Solar System. Another hundred years might see such advances that could see mankind leave this solar system.\nArticle Copyright \u00a9 2007 by I. E. Lester. All rights reserved.\nAbout the author\nI.E.

Really Like?\nThis is part 2 of I. E. Lester's article on alien life. You can read Part One in the previous issue of Darker Matter.\nScience fiction has long featured alien life. In films and on television this life has, for the most part, been very familiar in its makeup \u2013 two arms, two legs and a head atop a body; in other words human-like.\nOn the screen this makes sense. After all the viewers have to be able to connect with the characters, to understand them and sympathise with them. Also, actors have to play the characters, and if the aliens have a roughly humanoid shape and appearance then their job is made easier.\nSo we have the latex-forehead brigade of alien races \u2013 with a ridge here, a pointy ear there and perhaps some decorative spots all over being enough to persuade us viewers to accept these as alien.\nOkay: there are some non-humanoids every now and again; E.T. himself and the animatronic creatures in the Farscape series and Star Wars do come to mind but for the most part aliens in visual science fiction involve latex prosthetics.\nBut might this be more realistic than we think? Could this convenience brought forth by budgetary constraints actually be accurate to some extent? If we were to encounter alien life exactly what form would it take?\nThe honest answer has to be \"who knows?\" The human race has not detected life anywhere in the universe except on Earth. This has not stopped scientists speculating as to what we might find out there.\nCarbon-based Life\nCarbon Chauvinism is a belief common among exobiologist. As a term it is a little misleading. It does not imply any snobbery \u2013 a consideration that life based on elements other than Carbon would be inferior \u2013 but that Carbon is the only element with the right balance of chemical stability and reactivity to form and maintain the complex chemicals needed for life.\nAll life on Earth is based on Carbon. Carbon is a highly reactive element that forms complex molecules easily. Carbon is one of the five elements (together with Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Phosphorus) comprising Deoxyribonucleic Acid, or DNA \u2013 the molecules that hold our genetic code.\nCarbon is the core element in sugars, proteins and fats. Carbon forms Cellulose and Chitin, the cell walls of plants and the exoskeletons of insects, arachnids and crustaceans. Carbon is found in the haemoglobin molecule in our blood, in our muscles, our nervous system, teeth and bones. Every single part of our bodies and those of every living creature, plant or bacterium on Earth contains Carbon. 18% of the human body is Carbon.\nFor Carbon to be the basis of life there is another important ingredient required \u2013 liquid water. This places a few restrictions on the kind of environments where Carbon-based life might develop, as there is a relatively narrow temperature range in which water can exist as a liquid.\nThe Earth finds itself at just the right distance from the Sun so that it is not warmed too much, boiling away all the water; or too little, keeping any water the planet possesses locked in the form of ice. We only have to look at Venus and Mars to see the luck we had on this planet.\nPlanets that are similar to Earth and exist at Earth-like temperatures are likely to provide challenges for life very much like those evolution has overcome on Earth. So Carbon based life on other worlds is likely to be cellular, a form very familiar to us, and one that allows life forms to maintain a balanced, stable chemical environment.\nAlien microbial life may well be virtually indistinguishable from terrestrial microbes, and may prove a danger to any Earth-based life that encounters it since we would not have any immunity against its effects.\nMore complex life forms in these environments are also likely to have very familiar features. Creatures needing to manoeuvre through water are likely to possess an equivalent to fins; flying creatures would still require something akin to wings. The basic form of all life on Earth, bilateral symmetry, can also be assumed as this is the only way of achieving rapid movement in a controllable direction.\nThat evolution would work in the same way on another planet is a reasonable assumption. We just have to look at our own planet for evidence of this. Eyes have evolved more than once on Earth (human eyes are by no means the best that have evolved) \u2013 bat wings evolved separately to bird and Pterosaurian wings.\nIf we find an Earth-like world out there, it may well be VERY Earth-like. But Carbon is not the only element that might serve as a basis for life.\nSilicon-based Life\nThe next most likely contender for life is Silicon. Silicon is chemically very similar to Carbon, being a member of the same group in the periodic table. But Silicon has a number of factors against its being a basis for life. Silicon atoms are larger and heavier than Carbon atoms, and they do not form double or triple covalent Bonds quite as easily as Carbon.\nThis handicap can be overcome by including Oxygen in the compounds and having Silicone molecules as the basis for life. But the Silicon-Oxygen bond in Silicones is a very strong bond, and the energy required to break this bond \u2013 as would be needed for biochemical reactions \u2013 would seem to suggest such a biochemistry would be a non-starter. The Silicon equivalent of Photosynthesis just would not happen.\nAlso, Silicon Dioxide, the element's equivalent of Carbon Dioxide, is a solid at the temperatures where water is liquid, and a very stable compound. Any equivalent of respiration in Silicon based life forms would have difficulty disposing of the Silicon Dioxide produced.\nThere are more hurdles for Silicon life to overcome. First, we just have to look at Earth. Although the Earth is relatively Carbon poor and Silicon rich, life here is Carbon based. Also, by analysing the composition of interstellar space it has been found that there are ten times as many Carbon compounds as Silicon compounds \u2013 and half of the Silicon compounds we do find also contain Carbon.\nNitrogen, Phosphorus and Sulphur\nNitrogen is another element capable of forming long chain elements at low temperatures, using a liquid solvent such as Ammonia. Compounds with Nitrogen-only backbones, though, are unstable, reverting easily back to elemental Nitrogen.\nPhosphorus is also capable of forming long chain molecules, giving it the potential to form the kinds of complex macromolecules that are the building blocks of life, using Phosphine (PH3) as solvent. But Phosphorus is also too reactive for these long chain molecules to be stable.\nHowever, it's when you link these two elements together that things become a little more interesting. Nitrogen-Phosphorus compounds known as Phosphazenes, can form long, relatively stable chain molecules, but the energy required to create them is great \u2013 Nitrogen being so much more likely (chemically speaking) to form a bond with other Nitrogen atoms.\nEven if such bonds form, Phosphazene chains and rings are only stable in the presence of Oxygen if they have Carbon-based side groups. Phosphorus and Nitrogen are much more likely to exist as molecular Nitrogen and Diphosphorus Pentoxide.\nAbundance in the Universe is also a problem. Carbon is much more preferentially formed during the nuclear fusion occurring in Supernovae. So it's not likely that these elements exist in sufficient quantity for life to start.\nSuphur is another element capable of producing long-chains, and despite the fact that it too suffers from similar kinds of high reactivity problems as phosphorus and silicon, we do have evidence of life utilising sulphur. On Earth sulphur-reducing bacteria have been discovered, sustaining their existence with the energy from reducing elemental Sulphur to Hydrogen Sulphide. Although these are not true Sulphur-based life forms (they are still Carbon-based) it does show that nature can achieve many things. These bacteria use elemental Sulphur in place of Oxygen in their biochemistry.\nArtificial Life\nArtificial Life forms have long been a staple of science fiction. But just because they are found in fiction doesn't mean we will only find them in fiction. In recent decades, mankind has been building more and more advanced computers and robots. It would seem a reasonable assumption that any other advanced civilisation would also develop Artificial Intelligence.\nLife is fragile. We face so many possible catastrophes that may end all life on Earth, from natural disasters and diseases to our own folly. If we advance our levels of technology onwards a few years and then introduce such a disaster we could well leave a self-sustaining machine culture \u2013 one that, if sufficiently developed before all life ends, could continue its own mechanical evolution.\nAlso, given that we have started to send probes into space, venturing beyond the Solar System, it is possible that our first contact with another civilisation may come in encountering their space junk.\nIf There Is Life, Where Is It?\nIf we assume that life is common in the Universe then we face the Fermi Paradox. In 1950 physicist Enrico Fermi asked the simple question 'Where Are They?' \u2013 if life is common throughout the Universe, why is it we have not encountered it? One possible solution to this is distance. Mankind has only been capable of broadcasting signals outside the Earth's atmosphere for seventy years.\nWhen you compare this with the lifetime of the Earth this is an inconsequential period of time. The Earth and Sun were formed about four and a half billion years ago. It took over a billion years for life to begin in even a very basic way, a further two billion years before the first multi-cellular organisms appeared, and another billion years before animals began appearing on the land surface of our world.\nEven after complex creatures covered the whole Earth, intelligence did not automatically follow. Dinosaurs were the dominant species on Earth for tens of millions of years without ever suffering as a result of not having intelligence.\nSixty five million years ago everything began to change. The dinosaurs' day had ended and mammals began to become dominant, leading eventually to our own evolution. We as a species have been around less than half a million years.\nIt seems reasonable that intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe would also have required such a lengthy period to evolve. But the age of the Earth is a mere third that of the Universe. So could it be possible that life evolved on planets orbiting stars that formed earlier than that of the Sun?\nIt is possible, but not by all that much in terms of time. Our Sun is a second-generation star. First-generation stars formed from the elements available immediately after the Big Bang, when the Universe contained only the lightest elements, and none of the heavier elements necessary for life. Planets forming around these stars could only be Hydrogen dominated gas giants.\nThe heavier elements are formed in the massive explosion of a Supernova when a large star reaches the end of its life. These elements seed the gas clouds condensing into forming new stars, and so enabling rocky terrestrial planets to form around these second-generation stars, containing the range of elements required for life to eventually evolve.\nThis takes time: lengthy periods of time. Stars live for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of years depending upon their size (larger stars die sooner as they use far more of their fuels to maintain their equilibrium).\nSo for a planet to develop life it must have formed around a second-generation star \u2013 at a similar time to our Sun and Earth. This does not give life elsewhere all that much of a head start on us. And if the conditions on that world-out-there did not cause life too many headaches, it's possible that evolution might be happening on a far slower timescale.\nWe just do not have the ability at the moment to detect life on a small scale. Our search for extraterrestrials has been pretty much restricted to radio and similar signals. Science is moving forward though: the first water detected on an extrasolar Planet was announced in April 2007, so it is likely to be just a matter of time until we have evidence of more complex molecules on worlds out there.\nNext, we have to consider distances. The further we look out into the sky the further backwards in time we are looking. Our galactic neighbour, the Andromeda Galaxy, is over two million light years away. We see this Galaxy as it was more than two million years ago. If life evolved there a million years ago and began broadcasting the kinds of signals that can travel the intergalactic distances required for us to detect them, then those signals are still over a million years away from reaching us. Even staying within our own Galaxy, the Milky Way, there are stars 50,000 light years distant, and hence that far in our past.\nEven if we allow for civilisations having evolved that far in the past, there is also the sheer vastness of the Universe to consider. The Milky Way is a large Galaxy, containing an estimated 100 billion stars, but it is only one galaxy out of the billions in the Universe. So if another intelligent life form is out there, looking up at their sky and wandering if there is life out there, they too will face the same problem \u2013 where do you start to look to find other life-bearing worlds?\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by I.

The first radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy had been released (\"Escaped,\" was more the word, according to Douglas) and largely ignored in a late night slot on BBC Radio 4. It had then been repeated at a less perverse time, gathering listeners and momentum as the six episodes unfolded. But the books, the second radio series, the TV show and the long, long-delayed movie version were still to come.\nSo who did he read with relish, in these formative, creative years? And what made an author special for him? He could almost have been describing his own work as he paid his spontaneous tribute to the effortless, fertile genius of Kurt Vonnegut.\n\"Tom Stoppard. Otherwise, Tolstoy I love. Solzhenitsyn. Kurt Vonnegut, who I think is absolutely superb. I've read The Sirens of Titan six times now, and it gets better every time. He is an influence, I must own up. Sirens of Titan is just one of those books \u2013 you read it through the first time and you think it's very loosely, casually written. You think the fact that everything suddenly makes such good sense at the end is almost accidental. And then you read it a few more times, simultaneously finding out more about writing yourself, and you realise what an absolute tour de force it was, making something as beautifully honed as that appear so casual.\"\n\"The SF writers I like best are the ones who are funny, and there are not many of them.\"\nAnd the others, the usual suspects? Did he read Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and the rest?\n\"So Sheckley... and another guy I'm very fond of is Stanislav Lem, a Polish writer who has been superbly translated into English. That's doubly impressive because it's a very densely verbal style, with lots of word play. Translating it into English must have been extraordinarily difficult, and in many cases it's been very well done.\"\nDouglas had spent some time after university trying to sell the idea of science fiction comedy. People were happy enough to talk to him, as he had obvious potential as a comic writer and had established useful connections with various members of the Monty Python team. He even found himself writing with Graham Chapman for a period of 18 months or so, mainly on a bunch of projects that failed to see the light of day. But life was not without its frustrations.\n\"When I was working with Graham, a key figure in the Python team, I thought 'This is the Big Break.' But it turned out not to be. And I kept trying to sell the idea of a science fiction comedy, but no-one was interested. You could go along to a comedy producer and say 'This is science fiction' and he'd say 'This is drama \u2013 take it to a drama producer.' So you'd take it to a drama producer and he'd say 'Take it to a comedy producer.' Then Graham Chapman and I were commissioned by [Beatles drummer] Ringo Starr, of all people, to write a one-hour US TV special for him. That was SF comedy. But it never got made in the end, which was a shame, because there was some nice stuff in there.\"\nThen came the Big Break, Mk 2. The Robert Stigwood Organisation, which had had huge hits with Grease and Saturday Night Fever, commissioned a film treatment from Chapman and Adams.\n\"It was another film idea based on science fiction. But they eventually stopped that project because, as they said, 'We don't think there's a market for science fiction films.' As it turned out, that was about 12 months before Star Wars.\"\n\"I'd finally given up on the idea of science fiction comedy, simply because no-one was interested.\"\n\"I'd finally given up on the idea of science fiction comedy, simply because no-one was interested. But then Simon Brett suggested the idea to me. 'I'd like to do an SF comedy, and I think you might be the guy to do it.' And I sort of fell out of my chair.\"\nThe Red Sea had parted, and Douglas had the opportunity he had been waiting for.\n\"It was a couple of days after that that the title came. I had quite a lot of separate plots in my mind, each of which involved the end of the world, so we thought we were going to do six independent half hour stories, each ending with the end of the world. The thing was going to be called The Ends of the Earth, or something. Then I suddenly remembered what had struck me six years previously \u2013 but I hadn't done anything about it and hadn't even remembered in the intervening time \u2013 which was when I had been hitchhiking around Europe, when I was a student or just before I went up to Cambridge, I had this book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe. And I remember wandering into a campsite in Innsbruck late one night, being not entirely sober, and the stars were all out and I just remember thinking at that time 'Somebody should write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.'\n\"But being congenitally unable to see a good idea when it was staring me in the face, I didn't do anything about it for another six years. Anyway, then I did a treatment, describing what the show was going to be about, and it took a while for that to go through the [BBC] system. By this stage, I'd gone back and lived at home with my parents in Dorset. And then the BBC came back and said 'OK, write a first episode.' So I wrote a first episode, and that also took a while to go through, and then they came back and said 'Yes, OK. Go ahead and make it.'\"\nClick to hear a short segment of this interview.\nThere was no practice round. That first episode was the actual first episode, complete with bulldozers, Vogons, Ford Prefect, \"Lucky escape for Arsenal\", and, of course, the end of the Earth. The reaction was, for a surprisingly long time, silence.\nNext month:\nThe young Douglas Adams on comedy, money and turning radio into books into telly into films and who knows what. Plus why Dr Who left Douglas disappointed and where the science fits into science fiction.\nAbout the interviewer\nIan Shircore's career went into precipitous decline after this interview, as he travelled round the world, working in exotic places for The Australian and the South China Morning Post, and ended up as Head of Marketing for an artificial intelligence software company in Cambridge. He has written seven books, on English grammar, management psychology and Internet topics, most of them characterised by appalling timing.

But he'd been clean, hadn't touched a pill or lit up in months.\nWith a jaw-throbbing hum, Tay's boots activated. The foot he'd raised clanged back to the metal floor.\n'Raize, pull it back. I can't move.'\n'Sorry.' Her fingers tapped in commands.\nAmbulatory once more, Tay clumped to the control stations. 'We have atmosphere?'\n'Confirm on atmo.' Freeloader's silver eyepieces glinted in the white halogescent lights as he surveyed the outputted data. His movements, like his speech, were precise; he wasted neither processing resources nor energy on flashy words or gestures. An ironic turnabout, he kept himself aloof from human emotions and foibles, his reserve only breached during the interface sessions he shared with the AI.\nNext to him, Bomb nodded. 'Clear.' His voice rumbled low and gravelly through his barrel-wide chest.\n'Countdown commencing,' the computer announced. 'Termination of the universe in 10 . . . 9 . . . 8 . . .'\nEight seconds until the end of everything. No Earth, no galaxy, no existence.\nA cosmic joke or just bad math, there was a flaw in the makeup of reality that manifested every thirty-two thousand years. The rift was like a gap in the celestial highway, a pothole. When hit, it threw everything out of whack, shredding reality in its wake. But there was a fix: symbols, rituals, and equations older than the planet \u2013 maybe as old as the universe itself \u2013 that kept time and space from derailing over that bump.\nTay imagined Neanderthal men chanting around a fire while the world fell to pieces around them. Maybe the dinosaurs had been in on it, roaring and stomping the crucial symbols and sounds, safe in a leafy circle of protection. And before them, aliens perhaps, ancient consciousnesses performing the necessary structures and forms to smooth the universal pathway.\n'Have we got visuals?' he called.\n'I'm on it,' Raize said.\nThe viewer flashed up. Blackness filled the wide screen, punctuated by motley dots of light.\n'6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . .'\nThe viewer snapped into focus, and the whole galaxy appeared. Spiraling galactic arms laden with starry matter sharpened into clarity. They encircled a central congestion of brightness spreading in waves from the nexus.\n'Stasis field?'\nA sharp click sounded, and Bomb stuck his fist, thumb up, into the air.\n'2 . . . 1. Termination.'\nTay felt a ripple beneath his feet as the field engaged and separated their self-contained dome from everything of the outside world. He was faintly disappointed. He'd expected the end of the universe to feel different: more spectacular.\n'Look!' Raize pointed.\nOverhead, a slash of carmine split the creamy stars. The rift widened, shivering off splashes of glowing orange and seething yellow.\n'It's true.' Freeloader stared at the screen, his mouth slack. 'I didn't believe\u2014'\n'Mr. Freeloader, your station!' Tay snapped.\nThe ritualist's cap gleamed quicksilver as he scanned the scrolling readings. His palm stroked the tactile strip on the interface panel, the exchange of data reassuring computer and ritualist alike. 'Spells at normal parameters.'\nIn the viewer, the gash turned into a tear. Dazzling, white light overwhelmed the lesser, fiery shades until Tay's eyes watered.\n'Raize\u2014'\n'On it.' Just prescient enough to discomfit, she had anticipated him.\nThe viewer dimmed. In the center of the brilliance, a flicker of shadow obscured the wounded vista. It grew, tendrils of black spreading like a drop of ink in water, eating away the milky swirl.\nTay gripped the console until his knuckles whitened. The records had been vague on this part. But the protective spells, the runes and equations running in the computer, would keep them whole, isolated from the destruction or the chaos or the nothingness, whatever might happen. He hoped.\nRaize dropped to her knees, tears streaming from her eyes.\n'Holy Father of creation\u2014' She abased himself before the viewer, a litany of prayers spilling from her lips.\n'Raize\u2014?'\n'It's God!' she sobbed. 'Can't you see Him?'\nThe viewer showed the swelling black nothingness and nothing more.\n'Freeloader, confirm our status,' Tay called.\nThe ritualist whimpered at his console.\nTay clomped double speed to him. 'What's the matter? Is it the binary cascade again? I thought I'd debugged it.'\n'It's Him,' Freeloader moaned. 'The Great Destroyer, the Deceiver.' He covered his head with both arms.\nThe computer shrilled as the movement yanked Freeloader's interface connections free. A blue light blinked on the tower.\n'Mr. Freeloader, attend your station!'\nThe ritualist giggled. 'My station.' He reached out. 'My damnation.' Tay lunged, racing to slap aside Freeloader's hand, but the other man was faster. One silver-tipped finger knocked into the little red switch marked with a simple 'O' on one side and an 'I' on the other. With a whine, the systems began powering down.\n'No!'\nElectro-magnets released, and Tay's momentum took him past the AI station in a helpless spiral of freefall. Freeloader spun past him, cackling. Lunatic tears hung in the air, shed from his eyes and suspended like soft jewels in the zero gravity.\n'Bomb, emergency reboot!' Tay writhed, struggling to catch hold of anything solid that would stop his spin.\nThe huge man stood with his thick legs braced against two bolted down consoles. He spread his arms in a wide embrace.\nTay thunked into a steel hub wound with slick cables and delicate fiber contacts. He seized a handful of strut and cord just as the lights went out \u2013 the only illumination now the viewer's luminous glow.\n'Nirvana,' Bomb whispered. A beatific smile spread across the ugly man's face in the shadowed crimson.\nTay's breath billowed out in a mist of condensation. Despite all the insulation in the dome, the temperature was plummeting. To fall so quickly, it had to be cold as space outside. Was there an atmosphere anymore? Did the mountain the dome rested on still exist? He'd anticipated that heat and light, air, gravity even, might go haywire, so he'd programmed environmental safeties with multiple redundancies for each sub-system.\nBut the computer could only protect them if it was on.\nTay craned his neck to the viewer. The emptiness had eaten away more than half the image.\n'We're damned,' Freeloader moaned.\nTay ignored him, his teeth chattering in the now biting cold. The AI station \u2013 power grid, manual ports, and hard boot switch \u2013 was across the room, with Bomb anchored between them.\n'Out of my way, Bomb.' Tay gathered his legs against the strut and launched himself at the console.\nInstead of ducking, Bomb turned, his arms still outstretched. Tay could neither slow nor turn. The giant man plucked him out of the air, like a child from a swing, as he flew by. Tay's momentum knocked Bomb out of his stance, and they drifted.\n'Don't struggle,' Bomb murmured. 'Enlightenment comes with acceptance.'\n'What are you babbling about?' Tay fought to break the other man's hold, but before Bomb had hooked up with Freeloader and joined the team, he'd worked the streets as an enforcer. Tay was outsized, outmatched, and outmuscled.\n'It is Nirvana.'\n'It's not, you thickwit. It's the end of the universe. Can't you feel the cold?'\n'It is not cold.'\nTay twisted and strained, but Bomb might as well have been a stone block for all the effect it had.\n'Listen to me! Raize and Freeloader are hallucinating. We have to power everything back up and convince the AI to come online.'\n'The AI is not offline,' Bomb said. He swiveled Tay like a rag doll until he faced the viewer. 'Look.'\nThe blackness continued to eat a swath through the galaxy.\n'It's growing! We're running out of time.'\nBomb held him tight, pressing Tay against his chest. 'How is the viewer powered?' he murmured.\n'Huh?' Tay blinked. The viewer, of course, was also linked to the AI. How could it be on with the computer down?\nAs soon as he thought the question, the lights shuddered on, splashing them with bright white. They fell, dragged down by their powered boots.\nBomb rose to his feet and returned his attention to the viewer.\n'What's going on?' Tay asked.\nBomb neither turned nor answered.\nThe delicate ting of metal striking metal brought Tay twisting around. Behind him, Raize was on her knees tearing at her hair. Several of the little crucifixes had come loose, pulled down by the floor's magnetic field.\n'Forgive me, Father,' she sobbed, rocking back and forth. 'Forgive my sins.'\nBehind him, Freeloader's voice rose in a ragged cry. During Tay and Bomb's collision, the ritualist had pulled off his coverall, leaving him naked save for the metal implants mottling his body. He pressed himself in a frenzy against the computer's tactiles. The computer's warning lights flashed as its sensors overloaded.\n'Mr. Freeloader, what the hell are you doing?'\n'Fuck off.' Blood dripped from thin gashes in the ritualist's face where he'd dragged the metal tips of his fingers through his flesh.\nAbove him, a face appeared in the viewer, filling it. Eyes that bubbled and overflowed with tears of brackish pus glared out. Jaundiced skin writhed. Boils erupted, sprouting maggots topped with human features. Horribly, the faces were familiar; they wore the likenesses of people Tay had known: his mother before a cancerous tumor had sucked her life away; the last pusher he'd cut a deal with, spiky derma-implant patches bristling from his temple; the counselor in the institution with the sad, disappointed eyes.\nTwisted lips parted, revealing a mouth filled with rows of needle-thin teeth surrounding a spiraling void. The mouth opened; it was going to devour them.\nTay threw his arms up and fell against Bomb.\nThe larger man steadied him. 'Nirvana,' he said.\nTay peeked at the viewer over his forearm. The face was gone, replaced by the spreading abyss.\n'Father, why have you forsaken me?' Raize's voice was thick with sobs. She tried to crawl, but her heavy boots pinned her to the floor like an insect half-mashed by a careless giant.\nTay stumbled to her. He buried his face in her hair and felt her shudder.\n'Raize, baby, shush. We're all hallucinating.' He held her, breathing her vanilla and cloves perfume.\nShe went rigid. 'Sinner!' she screamed. She thrust him away, knocking him off balance. Tay sprawled, his feet still plastered to the floor.\n'It's because of you that God doesn't love me.' Her eyes were wide, frenzied. A slender data stylus appeared in her hand. 'God won't forgive me!' She launched herself at Tay, the stylus pointed at his groin.\nHe struggled to roll, but his boots glued him in place.\nBomb was there. He caught Raize mid-air and held her as she kicked and screamed. The stylus clinked to the floor.\nTay dragged himself away with shaking arms. The hatred in Raize's face \u2013 he turned his head so he wouldn't have to see it.\nIn the viewer, the scene had changed, monopolized by a new image. Bursts of lightning rayed out from a woman's face wreathed by a crackle of ozone-limned hair. It was a familiar visage, achingly dear and terrifying; it was Jandi, his wife.\nHuge, colorless lips curled into a sneer. 'It's all your fault, you know. I'd still be alive if it weren't for you.'\nTay shook his head. This wasn't, couldn't be real. It couldn't be.\nTears burned his eyes. How could he believe he'd be able to pull this off? The fate of the universe entrusted to him, the junkie, the loser; he hadn't even been able to save his wife.\nHe pressed his face to the floor. It really was preposterous. More likely that the whole thing \u2013 the cause, the calling, everything \u2013 was some drug-spawned delusion. After all, that last ride had almost killed him, forty beads of uncut tempt. Maybe he'd never come down. Maybe this was an elaborate fantasy and he was in a med facility, trapped in the dreamscape of his mind.\nBomb hummed a tuneless melody.\nTay lifted his head. The lightning-maned goddess was gone. The black rift was back, cutting across the galactic view.\nAround him, the room was in relative calm. Raize sobbed in Bomb's arms while Freeloader writhed against the computer's tactiles. The computer flashed red, erroring from the brutalization. Freeloader was raping it.\nThe viewer was a sliver of starlight away from complete black emptiness.\nTay closed his eyes. He'd always known, deep down, that Jandi blamed him. If only he could have kept his job. If only the AI industry hadn't gone bust.\nShe'd been so sick, in so much pain, and they couldn't afford her meds anymore; they could barely afford to eat. The pain had brought her screaming awake at night. His beautiful, fiery Jandi thrashed and shrieked her life away as he stood by, helpless.\nAnd then there'd been the day he'd taken the last of their money and bought tempt, two vials worth. Rec drugs were cheap, cheaper than food. He fed the tiny red pills to her, one by one, and held the water glass to her lips.\nShe hadn't needed them all. He'd held her in the darkness (no money for light), wrapped his arms around her, inhaled the scent of her skin. Then she was gone and Tay left behind.\nIf the universe ended, his desolation and grief would stop. Why was he fighting it? He'd yearned for this, slumped in alleys and on park benches, pursued it as he embraced his new love, murderous and merciful tempt.\n'Tay.' It was Jandi.\nHe opened his eyes. His wife's face filled the viewer, but it was no longer terrible. It was just Jandi with her butterscotch hair and the dragonfly tattoo over her cheek.\n'Remember our wedding vows?' she asked.\n'Yes. No. Darling\u2014'\n'I promised to love you forever and ever. Remember?'\nHe in a silly penguin suit, she in a gossamer white dress by the simulated waterfall with holograms of waving willow trees in the background.\n'Yes,' he whispered.\n'If the universe ends, so does forever, and without forever, there's nothing left of us.'\n'But what if this isn't real? What if this is just some junkie dream?'\n'Does it matter? Does it matter more than what we had? We were real.'\n'I miss you, Jandi. Every day, every hour, every minute. Oh God, I miss you.'\n'We loved as we lived, sweetly and well. It was good. And it ended as all things do. But one day, in another time and place, we will love again.' Jandi's brow furrowed, the way it always did when she was perplexed by one of Tay's rambling treatises. 'Won't we? Or is this truly goodbye?'\nJandi's image disappeared.\nTay screamed. No one paid any attention as he clambered to his feet. He couldn't lose Jandi, even if all he had were memories and a promise of another life's reunion. Even if it was a tempt dream, he wanted the universe back.\n'C'mon, think,' he panted.\nIn millennia past, a tradition passed down from thirty-second millennium to thirty-second millennium, the spells had been spoken, the symbols painted. People, aliens, unimagined consciousnesses had used rituals to set the universe back to rights. And Tay had converted these rituals into equations for the computer.\nTay stared at Bomb. He was the only one unaffected by hallucinations. But maybe they weren't hallucinations, maybe, protected as they were in a dome that contained the only reality, they were being affected by the only things that could touch them \u2013 Raize and her shame, Freeloader and his hedonism, and Tay himself with his guilt and grief.\n'We're making reality,' he whispered. 'Us. Instead of concentrating on the symbols and words, we're wallowing in the depths of our dysfunctions.'\n'Nirvana,' Bomb said.\nTay squeezed his eyes shut and put his hands over his ears. He envisioned Freeloader the ritualist, sane, calm, dressed, maintaining the computer operations like he had in all their simulations. He believed it. For Jandi, he believed it. He thought of Raize as she monitored readings and adjusted sensors, saw her fiddling with dials and buttons.\nThe computer stopped its plaintive distress sequence; the hum of normal processing replaced the high-pitched beeps. Freeloader sat at his station, eyes fixed on the displays. Raize tapped queries into her console.\nIn the viewer, a glimmer of light \u2013 no more than a speck \u2013 smoldered at the center of the blackness. As Tay watched, more spots of light began to emerge in a familiar pattern of stars and galaxies.\nThe universe was coming back.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Eugie Foster.

He saw the weather vane on the farmhouse pointing north.\nBut from the north . . .\nKansas City, St. Louis, even Chicago \u2013 good old Chicago, where Mayor Daley stole the election for Jack Kennedy \u2013 still glowed at night like an old alarm clock.\nRadiation drifted in with the wind from the north, from the ruins of the cities as well as the craters where the missile silos had been, scattered across the Mid-West plains.\nDamon walked back in the house and dialed the university.\n'Mornin', Tom,' the retired professor said. 'You see which way the wind is blowing?'\n'I've already checked the dosimeter on the greenhouse,' his younger colleague replied. 'The levels did go up, but we're still below 20 background rads. No need to run up the red flag today.'\n'Great, I'll be out in a few hours.'\nDr. Roger Damon lived ten miles from Texarkana, but there were only dirt roads from his farm to the highway, and what was once I-30 was now a patchwork of potholes.\nThe provisional Republic of East Texas had cordial relations with the Free City of Tyler, which had kept the oil flowing all these years from the pump jacks scattered throughout the Piney Woods.\n'Thank goodness they've kept the refinery in Tyler running,' he thought.\nAs he neared the city, his battered Chevy pickup rumbled over a wooden replacement bridge where the original concrete structure had crumbled. He could feel the planks sag.\nDamon was a professor emeritus of agricultural sciences. Tom Ledkins was the ag department head now. The old man recalled when his new grad assistant arrived from UT-Austin in the summer of '62.\nThey had just settled in together when it happened. October 1962 \u2013 that's when everything ended.\nThat's what people often said when referring to the war.\n'That's When It All Ended.'\nThe Provisional Republic of East Texas was strung along the I-30 corridor from Sulphur Springs to Arkadelphia, one of many polities which arose in the interstices of the ruins of civilization in America.\nTexarkana was its capital, and what had once been the University of Texas' branch in the city had been, for over 40 years now, the only college in the region. Tom Ledkins came to the UT-Texarkana campus in September 1962 to be Damon's grad assistant in plant genetics. He was there when the missiles flew.\nHe had helped keep the university up and running all these years, as Doc Damon's proteg\u00e9 and right-hand man, and had taken over as the department head when the old man retired a decade before. The old professor still kept an office for whenever he drove into town.\nHe rubbed his backside as he slid out of the seat of the ramshackle pickup, and steadied himself on the running board.\nHe looked at Ledkins and grimaced. 'I'm getting too old for this,' he groused.\n'You're always complaining about one thing or another,' said Ledkins with a smile.\n'At my age, there's always something to compain . . . I mean, complain . . . about!'\nThe pair walked to the university greenhouse.\nThe old man ran his hands over freshly picked ears of corn.\n'No irregularities that I can see,' he said. 'Is that what you found?'\n'Yes. I think the genomes have stabilized,' said Ledkins.\n'I wondered years ago whether I'd live long enough to see this,' said Damon with a slight waver in his voice.\nLedkins knew what he meant \u2013 the end of mutations and defects.\n'Some people thought the die-offs and mutations would never end,' said Damon, almost to himself.\nLedkins ran his hands through a pile of purple-hulled peas.\n'When I was an undergrad student, I hoped one day to study with Dr. Borlaug and help feed the world population,' he said. 'I guess the war took care of the problem.'\nDr. Damon looked up. 'How are things in the human population?'\n'We're doing good. Some stillbirths, but at this point, I think it's fair to say the badly mutated or injured have died off or become hopelessly sterile.'\nThe younger man walked over to a desk and picked up a sheaf of papers.\n'I just got a fascinating packet from the Transvaal, from the human genome project at the University of the Witwatersrand.'\nThe old professor cocked his head. 'What do the folks in Johannesburg want with us?'\n'They're interested because we've had to deal with ongoing problematic background radiation for so long. They have completed some fascinating research on human chromosomes \u2013 research we probably would have carried on if things hadn't been so bad here.\nHe looked across the lab table at the old man.\n'Do you ever recall hearing about recombinant DNA?'\n'Goodness, that was the most speculative, cutting edge technology before the war,' he said. 'They had just begun mapping the genetic code. There was talk that it might be possible to, uh, splice genes using viruses to transfer genetic material to different places in the . . . what did they call them?'\n'Double helixes. A pair of Brits figured out that RNA-DNA pattern in the 1950s. They got the last Nobel Prize, back in '62.'\nThe old man sat down on a stool. 'Wow, I haven't thought about that in years.'\n'Well, the two main research groups, in the RSA and New Zealand, have been able to carry on that research,' said Ledkins.\n'Of course, their main impetus has been to see if it is possible to minimize birth defects,' he continued. 'And now, according to the papers they just sent me, they have another project in mind.'\nThe old man rested his hands on his knees. 'Go on, I'm listening.'\n'They have been doing some cutting edge research on how we can better cope with the lingering background radiation in areas that need to be repopulated. You know, between Wits and the University of Auckland, they've just finished 30 years of plotting the human chromosome.'\nThe old man waved his hand in the direction of the university lab building as he mopped his brow with the other.\nThey continued to talk as they walked into the academic building, where an evaporative cooler put out gusts of moist air.\n'What do they want with us?' asked Damon.\n'They think they've identified a non-coding gene segment in the human chromosome that may offer some somatic resistance to radiation,' said Ledkins.\n'Sorry, young man,' Damon said, smiling. 'Now you've lost me. What exactly is a non-coding gene segment?'\n'One thing they've learned, now that they've finished the Human Genome Project, is that they can't see any apparent use for maybe half of all the genes. There's a lot of junk and redundancy in there.'\n'I see. And they think this redundancy in the hereditary substrate is nature's way of providing plasticity in evolution,' said Damon, 'and they want you to look in our population, which has had many people born and living with amounts of background radiation since the war, to see whether any of these non-coding gene fragments have shifted around to where they can be useful in providing resistance to the somatic effects of radiation. Right?'\nProfessor Ledkins stopped and stared with a smile at the old man. 'Damn, you're good!'\n'What do they plan to do with that information? Use that gene transference idea and put viruses to work splicing genes?'\n'Like I said, Doc, you've still got it.'\nThe old man sat down heavily on a stool in the lab.\nHe smiled. 'What's in it for us?'\n'They've offered to ship us a Confocal 3-D laser scanning microscope, made by Leica-SA in 2001.'\n'Sounds like a good deal. I'm glad to see research moving ahead so well, after getting knocked back for so many years. I remember how bad things were, right after . . . it all happened . . . '\nLedkins walked over to his old battered binocular microscope which still had Property of the University of Houston embossed on a metal plate at its base. The best Bausch & Lomb had to offer at one time, it had been retrieved from the ruins of the city in the 1970s.\nHe squinted as he flicked the switch and popped in a slide. He peered intently into the eyepiece.\n'You know, I think I can find the gene segment the folks at Wits are referring to. Once I pick it out in a sample, I'll be able to find it in some of our subjects.'\nThey both turned as a young dark-haired woman walked into the lab.\n'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.'\n'That's OK, Jeannie, I was just filling in Doc Damon here on the samples we're planning to take \u2013 you know, for the folks in South Africa.'\nThe old man smiled. 'What about you, young lady?' She laughed. 'Of course. I was born since the war.'\nLedkins turned back to the microscope. 'We've made a special effort to line up parents and children, to see if we can detect any change in the chromosomes between those born before and after the war.'\n'The whole Vega family is coming in,' said Miss Thompkins. 'That's five people born before the war and eleven after.'\nDamon waved his hand. 'I knew Mike Vega back in the 1950s! He was the groundskeeper at the football stadium.'\nLedkins chuckled. 'He's still going strong, and works in his garden every day.'\nHe pointed in the direction of the window and the greenhouse they had just left.\n'That's where we get some of our test corn.'\n'Sounds like y'all have everything under control,' said Damon as he rose. Ledkins and Thompkins smiled at each other.\n'I'm going to my office.'\n'It's nice to see him come in every so often,' said the grad assistant after he left.\n'I know, it helps keep him up and about. He's almost 90 now, you know,' said Ledkins.\nHe flipped through a box of slides.\n'He's one of the last of the generation who got us through those times,' he said as he popped another slide in.\n'You were there, too,' she said.\n'Yes, but I was even younger than you are now. I just helped out in any way I could.'\nHe turned his head to smile at her.\n'Let me know when you start to collect those samples.'\nLedkins caught a flash of his black armband out of the corner of his eye as he reached forward to make some adjustments to the Confocal microscope. He leaned back.\nDoc Damon had been gone a month now. It was time to move on, he thought. He took the armband off, and folded it neatly in his desk drawer. As he sat back down, he remembered that his old friend and mentor died the day after the microscope arrived. He had never seen it.\nLedkins caught a glimpse of his own gray hair reflected in the viewer of the microscope. 'People used to retire when they reached 65,' he thought. 'Not any more. Not when the work goes on.'\nIt was people like Damon, he thought \u2013 the same hard-working level-headed people who were left behind after It All Ended \u2013 who had worked day and night to stabilize society and keep civilization going.\nThe bombs had done the worst damage, but the famine and breakdown in society had destroyed just as much \u2013 if not more.\nPlaces such as Austin, where Ledkins remembered so many good times in college \u2013 and which hadn't been touched by a bomb \u2013 had slid into barbarism. They said the Warlord Whitman and the Barton Springs Banditos still ruled the city with guns and blood.\nIt would be easier to send settlers into depopulated areas than to fight to bring back the rule of law to places such as that, where the people had destroyed themselves, he thought.\nHe heard Jeannie come into the lab. He spoke without looking up.\n'I'm checking the samples you laid aside. So far, so good. You were right.'\n'We had a good three dozen subjects.'\n'These three samples you indicated all seem to have the radiation-resistant DNA moved to where it would be somatically effective,' he said as he leaned back from the microscope.\n'Of course, I would suppose with so many people walking around with shattered genes after the war,' he continued, 'some of the ones we've been looking for would float around and settle where they would be effective.\nHe peered back into the microscope. 'This lateral transfer of the previously non-coding DNA is exactly what the folks in Joburg were asking us to look for.'\n'I've finished collating the results of the physicals for our subjects,' she said. 'They certainly seem to bear out the theory. Everyone seems healthy enough.'\nThere was something in her voice that made him look back up again.\n'Is there something else?'\n'The three people with the laterally-transferred DNA: did you notice who they are?'\nHe looked over at some notes. 'Carl Dombeck, Tom Burlingham and Mike Vega, Jr. Is there a point?'\n'Mike Vega, Jr is the old man who keeps the garden at the edge of town.'\n'Are you sure? I assumed it was his son.'\n'No, he doesn't have any sons. Mike Vega is 87. He was 45 when the war happened. Remember, he once worked here at the university? Doc Damon remembered him.'\n'But the resistant DNA is where it should be!'\nJeannie held out her hands. 'Sorry, it doesn't make any sense to me, either. He was born with that gene fragment right where we were looking \u2013 but at the end of World War I, not World War III.'\nLedkins rested his head on his chin. 'OK, that makes no damn sense.'\n'Maybe you should go and talk to the old man. There might be something in his background to explain it.'\nLedkins pushed his stool back.\n'I will.'\nMike Vega's home was just past the cordon maintained by the Texarkana Municipal Militia. Because the roads were so rough, Ledkins took Doc Damon's old Chevy pickup which the old man had left him, rather than subject his Corvair to the pounding of the road.\nWhen he pulled up, Vega was hacking at the hard, dry earth with a hoe. The old man looked up. Ledkins pulled off his hat and nodded respectfully. Vega let his hoe drop.\n'Professor Ledkins! I am honored.'\nThey shook hands at the gate. The old man still had a firm clasp.\n'If you have come to tell me after the tests that I am too old and must die soon \u2013 that is not news!'\nThey both laughed, and Vega motioned the professor inside his small frame house. It didn't have electricity, but the widower had a refrigerator that ran on propane.\nHe poured Ledkins a tall glass of iced tea and crushed some fresh mint from his garden. Vega poured a glass himself and Ledkins looked at him \u2013 carefully, but respectfully \u2013 as he drank. The old man has Indian features \u2013 very Mayan, thought Ledkins. Perhaps that was a clue. He knew it would be impolite to come right to the point, so he made small talk for 15 minutes before Vega wiped his damp hands on the front of his overalls and put his hands on the table to signify it was time to really talk.\nLedkins spoke simply and clearly about what he had been researching, and looked carefully to see if the old man followed him.\n'My father lived to be 92 and never was sick a single day,' said Vega. 'His father lived to be 88 and never so much as wore a coat a day of his life. We are a strong people. It is in the blood.'\n'Yes, but your father and his father didn't live their lives with the poison in the air we've had since the war,' said Ledkins.\n'This wasn't the first war our people have lived through,' said Vega.\n'Certainly, the first of this kind,' said Ledkins.\n'Perhaps.'\nThe professor stopped in mid-sip.\n'What do you mean?'\nThe old man chuckled in a very sardonic way and then looked very stern.\n'You white people are so vain. You think you invented everything.'\nThe old man laughed again at the professor's expression.\n'My father's people were priests in the temple of the Aztecs before the coming of the Conquistadors. They were priests in the temple going back thousands of moons. And they served the Aztlans before the Aztecs.'\nThe old man leaned on the table and looked down his nose at Ledkins.\n'Our family legends say the Aztlans warred among themselves and cast fiery lances that withered the crops and burned up their great cities. My father's people were blessed by the Corn God for their service in their temples, and given drops of the blood of the Gods, so they would not be harmed by the fiery death.'\nThe old man nodded at the professor's stunned expression.\n'Yes, I thought of those legends in the days when It All Ended, of those fiery lances falling from the sky. It seems your people were not as wise as they thought. They made the same mistake my ancestors made`.'\nVega laid his hand on his chest.\n'My people learned their lesson, and never made the weapons of fire again. Will your people learn the same lesson?'\n'I don't know what to say,' Ledkins stammered.\nThe old man's expression changed completely. He put on a big smile.\n'Say, 'thank you for the cold mint tea, se\u00f1or!''\nAs they walked to the road the old man cast a brief downward glance which told Ledkins he had been respected with a great insight. They shook hands, and the professor made the dusty drive back into Texarkana in Doc Damon's old pickup.\n'Although it's obvious that in some cases, the resistant gene relocated itself laterally as a result of a mutation produced by radiation exposure,' said Ledkins, 'it's apparent in Migel Vega's case that the mutation occurred naturally, possibly as a result of exposure to naturally occurring radioactive material. At least, that's what the report to the folks in the RSA will say.'\n'So you'll blame it on NORM. Think they'll buy it?'\n'I don't know, Jean. What else can we tell them?'\nThe young lady looked at him. 'Do you believe Vega's story?'\n'I really don't know Jeannie. I really don't know.'\nHe leaned into his desk and dropped his first draft of the report into a drawer. As he leaned back, he looked down and noticed a steel blue revolver \u2013 like the kind Mike Hammer would have used \u2013 nestled in the back.\nEveryone carried guns, back in the first days after the war. He'd had to use it a few times himself. The thought of the futility of it all passed through his mind like a mist. A thought that made him dizzy.\n'Are you OK, professor?'\nHe looked down and shoved the drawer shut with his foot.\n'I'm just tired.'\nHe tried to gather his wits about him. 'What else do we need to do today?'\n'Well, I don't know about you, but there is something I need to do. I've put off something for a while.'\nHe looked up and saw she was smiling at him.\n'I know how much Dr. Damon meant to you, as a mentor and friend,' she said.

I just liked those two. 'There are only two of the shows I ever listen to \u2013 numbers 2 and 3. I just liked those two.\n'All the others worried me, for one reason or another.'\nThe fact that even the self-critically perfectionist Adams liked Episodes 2 and 3 comes as something of a relief.\nEpisode 2, for example, introduces Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian and Marvin the Paranoid Android ('Life? Don't talk to me about life'), and includes Vogon poetry, over-smug automated doors and Eddie, the shipboard computer.\nEpisode 3 includes the custom planet-making industry on the legendary planet of Magrathea, Slartibartfast, the coastline designer who was so proud of having done Norway ('That was one of mine. It won an award, you know. Lovely crinkly edges'), the planet inhabited by lost biros, where Veet Voojagig worked as a chauffeur 'driving a limousine for family of cheap green retractables', and important revelations about Man, mice and dolphins ('So long, and thanks for all the fish'). It also introduces the 10 million-year project to find the Ultimate Question.\nEach of these two 30-minute scripts is crammed with enough ideas, jokes and twisted perspectives to power a three-hour Hollywood blockbuster, which is exactly the problem the moviemakers ran into when they eventually tried to capture Hitchhiker's on screen.\nThe sheer density of ideas packed into each show makes listening demanding, as well as enjoyable, and can leave the audience half-dazed at the end of an episode. No-one can pick up all the nuances at a single hearing, but everyone can hear enough to know that this is something that's worth going back to.\nThis may help to explain why The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was so good at turning casual listeners into addicts. If the original radio shows contained too much to take in at one go, people were bound to demand that they should be rebroadcast, that recordings should be made available to buy and that there should be some written record of the scripts. This set Douglas up neatly for the publication of the first book, which, in retrospect, marked the moment when Hitchhiker's turned from a cult object into a blazing mainstream hit.\nAt the time of this interview, two airings of the first series on BBC Radio 4 had hardly begun to make him a star. He was working on the first Hitchhiker's book and hoping for the best, not knowing, of course, that it would go straight into the UK bestseller charts at number 9 and set him firmly on the path to fame and fortune.\n'I've always wanted to write a novel because, well, everyone wants to write a novel.' 'I don't want to just reproduce the scripts \u2013 that'd be rip-off time. And I've always wanted to write a novel because, well, everyone wants to write a novel. I just know I would never have got round to it, except that someone approached me and said \"Will you write a novel based on this?\"'\nDouglas had his own treasured jokes and sequences in the original radio series. He was particularly proud of Eddie, the shipboard computer, which progresses from over-effusive friendliness to wobbliness under pressure and an eventual near-breakdown, accompanied by a chorus of You'll Never Walk Alone, as the spaceship plunges towards oblivion.\n'I like the Eddie bits. But one of my favourite parts of the whole thing is the Galactic News report, \" . . . a big hello to all intelligent life-forms everywhere. And to everyone else out there, the secret is 'Bang the rocks together, guys.'\"'\nThe whole business of making science fiction comedy work the way he wanted it to was something Douglas took immensely seriously. He felt he had been through a long and tough apprenticeship in Cambridge Footlights productions and working on the fringes of the Monty Python set-up. His lanky figure had even been seen on screen in one Python sketch, though the surgeon's mask he was wearing meant that few people stopped him in the street for autographs afterwards.\nIt had been a hard road for him, and there had been some major disappointments.\n'I left Cambridge and got in with the Pythons and everyone said \"God, he's doing terribly well.\" Then everything fell down, desperately hard, and I thought \"Here I am, aged 24, and I'm totally washed up. This is it.\"\n'At that stage, I felt the last two years or so had been a total waste of time. I hadn't got anywhere and nothing had happened. I thought: \"I'm not a writer. I can't survive in this business.\"'\nBut he was wrong. He was a writer, and a survivor, and his turbulent professional apprenticeship had taught him some important lessons.\n'I think what you actually learn is the art of self-editing. It's that ability to look at a line dispassionately and not feel attached to it just because you've written it.\n'It's also a matter of confidence. When you look at something and you don't even know how you managed to write it anyway, and you don't think you can actually write anything more ever again, you don't want to cut bits out, because you think, \"That's all I've got.\"\n'When you know that in the past you've had enough good ideas to make things work, you're more prepared to make cuts, because you're prepared to believe you can actually do something better than that.'\nDouglas rated professionalism very highly. It was something he consciously developed in himself, and it was also something he recognised and appreciated in other people. His musical tastes \u2013 in particular, his fondness for Paul Simon \u2013 reflected his awareness of similar professionalism in other fields. Douglas liked the Beatles, the Who and, later, Pink Floyd, with whom he eventually played on stage. But Paul Simon was the first and formative influence.\n'I taught myself to play the guitar by listening to Paul Simon records, working it out note by note. He is an incredibly intelligent musician. He's not someone who has a natural outpouring of melody like McCartney or Dylan, who are just terribly prolific with musical ideas.\n'He obviously finds that very difficult, and I can identify with that, because I find writing very difficult. He is an incredibly clever, literate musician, but he always makes it sound terribly simple. I like the feeling that he's had to work hard for what he's got and has then been modest enough to disguise it.'\nBefore his career and destiny as a writer was established, Douglas had been through a wide range of other career ideas. At the age of eight, he wanted to be a nuclear physicist, though that was then followed by a long period of terrible worry because he thought there was nothing he wanted to do with his life.\n'Then one day I saw The Frost Report. It was the first time I'd seen John Cleese on television, and I thought \"Aha, that's what I want to be.\"'\nUnfortunately for Douglas, that job was already taken. But a lot of his tribulations over the next few years could be seen as stemming from a quest to become John Cleese in a way that would work for him.\nThe young Douglas's early interest in science obviously resurfaced in the context of Hitchhiker's, which is laden with references to scientific concepts most of us can't begin to understand. According to Douglas in 1979, we are not alone.\nHe had done science at O-level but not A-level ('I was quite good at physics, but not at maths \u2013 my conceptual ability was quite good, but my arithmetic was appalling') and much of what he knew about science was picked up, as a child, from attending the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures for Children. Apart from leftover scraps like Boyle's Law and some bits about the behaviour of light, there was little formal scientific background available to him. And anyway, making it up from scratch was always going to be more fun.\n'You start from first principles. If you can see the logic underlying those principles, however basic and simple they are, then you can see ways they can be put to work against each other.\n'And if you can keep a logical grasp of that but also have the imagination to make the jumps between one thing and another to see how they might be connected, then I think you are liable to be thinking in much the same way the scientist does.\n'A good scientist will make complicated things seem simple, because they're all actually arrived at from simple principles. So that's how I set about it.'\nWorking everything up from basics like this, in the interests of SF comedy, had already led the young Douglas Adams into areas where only experts normally tread. For example, he had unwittingly carried one of his Dr Who scripts to the very frontiers of late-1970s cosmology.\n'I had a letter from a guy about something I'd written in a Doctor Who script, to do with super-compressed matter, degenerate matter and gravitational fields.\n'That particular bit of the script came from realising, late at night, when I thought I'd more or less got the thing finished, that I had 13 super-compressed planets I hadn't accounted for, which I somehow had to do something with.\n'So I sat up and sat up and practically hosed myself down with black coffee and finally came up with a solution, just on the logic of it. And I had a letter from this astrophysicist saying \"Where did you find out about this? We're only doing the work now.\"\n'When you write something like that you can place the tiniest piece of information you have so that it sounds like the tip of the iceberg of a vast amount of knowledge. And very often it isn't.'\nRead Part 4 now Interview Copyright \u00a9 1979, 2007 by Ian Shircore.

To qualify for these experiments candidates had to be of good health, between 25 and 50 years of age and be a non-smoker of no more than 185cm (6 ft) in height. As the experiments will be taking place in a 550 cubic metre modular \"spacecraft\" situated at the Russian Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow, a working knowledge of both Russian and English is also required, a fact which ruled me out even if my 201cm frame had not already.\nThey will have to endure the cramped conditions, the lack of privacy and high workload of a mission. There will be a number of simulated scenarios to undergo including the launch, walking on the Martian surface and an emergency or two. All contact with the outside world is going to be the same as would be experienced if the volunteers were out in space: it will be subject to a lengthening delay. And to make matters worse, all they will have to eat are the types of rations used on the International Space Station.\nThe goal of these experiments is to discover just how the astronauts on the actual mission to Mars might react to their lengthy period of isolation, shortages of supplies and stress, and how the dynamics of a group might develop over such a lengthy period.\nAll of this is for a trip to a near neighbour, just one planet out from Earth. Science recently has been discovering more and more extrasolar planets, systems where we might find a suitable environment to support human life. Mankind has a history of pushing frontiers, of striving to go that little bit further. So in future decades mankind may well be looking to venture outside our solar system even if we do not have superluminal (faster than light) travel.\nThe question, though, is: just what will that involve? Even travelling a distance as short as that to Mars is taxing our levels of technology and commitment. At its furthest point from Earth, Mars is a mere 21 light minutes, or 400 million kilometres away. The nearest star to us, other than the Sun, Proxima Centauri is 4.3 light years away, or about 40 trillion kilometres. The nearest star known to have a planetary system, Gliese 581, is nearly five times that distance at 20.5 light years.\nThe fastest man-made objects so far have been the Voyager spacecraft, which reached speeds of some 59,000 kilometres per hour as they left the solar system. Even if we averaged this speed then reaching Proxima Centauri would take 80,000 years.\nMethods of Propulsion\nThese craft used conventional means of propulsion. Traditional engines, be they internal combustion engines or rockets, require the vehicle to carry a fuel supply. On an interstellar trip this would be prohibitive in terms of weight, as well as in terms of the immense amounts of fuel we would be sending off into the heavens. So other methods of propulsion are required. There are several suggestions for how to achieve this.\nOne possible method of propelling an interstellar craft is Nuclear Pulse Propulsion (also called External Pulsed Plasma Propulsion in a recent NASA mission proposal). This method involves a craft being accelerated by the Plasma Waves generated by a series of nuclear explosions directly behind the vehicle.\nThis method, of course, exposes the craft to massive amounts of radiation and so would require the crew compartments to be heavily shielded, which would add to the weight.\nIn the 1960s an American physicist called Robert W. Bussard proposed a Ramjet, powered by collecting Hydrogen from the Interstellar Environment by means of a scoop (called a Ramscoop) on the front of the spacecraft and funnelling it into a nuclear fusion reactor. There are a number of problems to overcome with this option, not withstanding the fact that we have yet to design a nuclear fusion reactor.\nAs the density of the interstellar environment is very low, the Ramscoop needs to be very large: on the order of tens of kilometres in diameter. Solid Ramscoops cannot be used, so an Electromagnetic or Electrostatic Field would be needed to funnel the required particles to the reactor. For this type of Ramscoop to be able to collect fuel the particles ahead of the ship would need to be Ionised, possibly by means of a laser.\nSince Bussard outlined his Ramjet, other scientists have analysed the concept and have cast doubt on the feasibility of such a device. Since the 1960s it has been discovered that the region surrounding our Solar System has a considerably lower particle density than previously thought and so would not provide as much fuel. Also Ramjet design attempts have so far not been able, in theoretical models, to provide sufficient thrust to overcome the drag effect of collecting the Hydrogen Ions. The Ramjet's saving grace may lie in combining it with another propulsion method.\nAnother such method is a solar sail. Solar sails are effectively large mirrors. When photons from the Sun (or any other star) reflect off such a mirror they give the craft a very small push. This push is minute and lessens as the distance from the source object increases, just as the brightness of a light bulb diminishes as you walk away from it. But it could provide a reliable, if slow, acceleration.\nSunlight, however, is not the only method of providing the push such a sail would need. Any form of radiation would work, so a series of microwave emitters constructed in space could be used as launch platforms for such craft.\nThe Human Factor\nThese current concepts of interstellar propulsion all envisage a maximum cruising velocity of no more than 10 per cent of light speed. This is an estimated maximum though, not an absolute guarantee, so for the rest of this article an average speed of 5 per cent of light speed will be assumed. Our trip to Proxima Centauri would therefore take a little over eighty years, and to reach Gliese 581 we would need four centuries.\nWe also need to consider the accelerations and decelerations of the craft. Human beings are \"squishy\": accelerate us too quickly and we suffer. Astronauts are trained to withstand accelerations of 8 or 9 times Earth gravity for short periods - but these accelerations are very short-lived. Even at a constant acceleration of 10 G, accelerating to the speeds of Voyager would take many minutes. Any passengers would be long dead before this speed could be reached.\nThis should not be considered much of a restriction. Accelerating at a rate of 1 G would still result in reaching our 5 per cent of light speed in just a matter of days, a small fraction of the total length of such a voyage.\nSo what would we need to consider for such a project to be feasible? Even before we think of the technical requirements of the ship there is the simple matter of the crew. These voyages are far longer than a single human life span.\nSo we either need to induce a form of hibernation among the crew and have them sleep through the voyage, or accept that the initial crew of the mission will be dead long before the ship reaches its destination, as will their children, grand children and several more generations.\nScientists have recently been moving suspended animation from the realms of science fiction and into reality. In 2005 a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington led by Mark Roth proved that Hydrogen Sulphide could be used to induce a hibernation-like response in mice, a species which does not hibernate in nature. Further experimentation is ongoing in larger species, including dogs and pigs, although it will probably be quite some time before this is a viable option for humans. In the meantime we are left with long term multi-generation missions.\nThis type of long length mission will require a considerably larger crew than any space mission mankind has yet undertaken, as too small a group would not allow for sufficient genetic diversity to maintain a viable colony.\nThe minimum accepted number is about 180 people, with a relatively even split between men and women. Although it has been proposed that to save weight and resources in the initial phases of the project a smaller all female crew could be chosen with frozen sperm replacing the need for men in the first generation.\nClosed Ecology\nSustaining a population even as small as this over such a long term so far removed from Earth provides more problems to overcome. Human beings have rather basic needs\u2014we require oxygen, water and food. We produce waste materials that poison our environment.\nIn everyday life on Earth these are not things that concern most of us overly. The Earth is a vast ecosystem that is self-balancing (when we are not overtaxing its regenerative abilities with our industrial lifestyles). Microbes reprocess our waste, providing raw materials for the plants, which convert the energy of the Sun into a form we can eat providing the oxygen we breathe in the process.\nOn short space missions astronauts and cosmonauts take all they need for their missions with them, their food, their water and the air they breathe. But as with fuel, the weight of sufficient supplies is prohibitive so the vessels must be self-sustaining, being capable of generating their own supplies. Essentially what is needed is a miniature Earth-like ecosystem.\nMany such systems have been set up on Earth. The Soviet Union built such environments in the 1960s and 1970s. The Americans built Biosphere 2, a three-acre enclosed ecological system built in Arizona in the late 1980s. It included its own ocean, rain forest, desert, and temperate zone. Eight people entered Biosphere 2 on September 26th 1991 and remained sealed inside for two years, despite problems including lower than desired agricultural produce. Problems in a subsequent experiment led to the project being ridiculed in the popular press and losing favour with the scientific community.\nThe European Space Agency has since announced MELiSSA (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative). This project is intended to develop the kinds of technology we will need for an Interstellar Generation Starship to sustain its inhabitants over many decades.\nGenerations\nBut beyond simple biology there is also the matter of the crew society. Anthropologists and psychologists believe that the traditional military structure of all current space missions and organisations will not be suitable for such multi-generation endeavours. Over such lengthy periods a more tribal or familial structure will be necessary, with the basic bonds between parents and offspring, brothers and sisters providing the glue to keep the society stable, and avoiding the anarchy portrayed in many science fiction tales featuring generation ships.\nIf you have ever played Chinese Whispers you will be all too aware of just how passing a message between people can change its meaning with each person interpreting the message slightly differently. Over the course of generations this could be extreme. Instruction manuals might almost become religious texts and crew positions almost holy.\nEqually, the knowledge of how things work could easily become lost, with the people maintaining the systems becoming little more than mindless automata endlessly repeating instructions passed down to them by previous generations. To a large extent, then, it will be necessary to automate as many of these processes as is possible.\nEqually it is important to consider boredom. On Earth the range of activities in which one can participate is vast. In a closed environment this range is reduced. Thankfully , though, as technology advances, miniaturisation will allows these craft to include far more entertainment media without the need to substantially increase weight.\nDestination\nIf we accept that all the hurdles in building such a ship have been overcome and a target world has been selected, there is still the matter of what happens when the ship arrives. It is unlikely that any planet out there will be exactly like Earth. It could be that it is close enough that hardy settlers would be able to adapt to their new home, but more likely the planet will need to be adjusted to suit Earth-type life forms.\nSo, if we achieve the scientific advances necessary to reach a new Earth, converting this world to be suitable for human life\u2014Terraforming\u2014will then be the final hurdle we will need to overcome for the desire of a human colony world out there amongst the stars be achieved.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by I.

The kids wasted no time in sicking their aluminum and bristle pet on me. Half way to Middle Zone, they pushed the attack button and up whoofed Fido, chain link teeth clacking and grinding, its LED eyeballs blazing with tin-headed ire.\n\"Driver!\" I yelled, with no response. The fuses had been jacked and the commlinks stuck in open phase so no security options were available. No street side cops, even if there were any in this part of town, would be summoned.\nAs a fully-hipped Earthling, I knew that if I moved a muscle, Fido's motion detector would signal a clamp down. A clamp down is a move copied from some pit bull that had a digital recorder strapped to its head one day long ago. It was fighting another of its kind at the time while money rapidly changed hands just outside the ring. At one point in the bout, the pit pull with the camera would have clamped down on its opponent, holding on till a bone snapped, a neck crumbled, or the honorable opponent suffocated. On this day after the pit bull wannabe jettisoned onto my lap, I sat rigidly still, because the original cameradog would have been particularly mad at the time of the virtual programming. Assuredly, its clamping powers would have been heightened by the tension in the air. If said human dared to move said muscle, surely a bone break and flesh wound so deep it would take years to stop pussing, would ensue. I was quite sure the kids had not kept up with their pet's preventive maintenance schedule; it was all rusty hinge and jagged edge. I'm not a brave person when it comes to pain and besides, I was having trouble recalling when I'd last received a tetanus shot. I used my foot to move the wicker case over in the direction of the fun-loving kids. That's what they were after, that wicker basket.\nJust before the bus lurched to its next stop, the youngster with the dazzling neck chain and handy remote clicked Fido back off my lap. His pal with a naked chest, scarred from some ritual akin to the Sioux Indian sun ceremony grabbed my wicker box. The four of them lit out madly through the bus door, Fido bringing up the rear.\n\"Fuck you and your little dog too!\" I shouted after the door had closed behind them. \"And that goes for you as well,\" I called up to the computer console running the bus, as if that would hurt its feelings.\n\"You're welcome,\" came the canned response.\nI was not amused. On the other hand, I was hardly upset. Wicker cases cost the equivalent of fifty cents on Shap. I always purchase one, fill it with bricks, and carry it with me whenever I have to return home during the night hours. The strategy went with my old territory, Earth.\nI stood up when Target Lane appeared on the overhead readout. The bus lurched again and the exit expanded open. I placed my baggage in manual mode and dragged it off the bus, one step at a time, making a big show of how heavy it was. It slumped dead on the street off the bottom step and lay there from the ballast I had stowed earlier when I was stomping off Shap.\nThe bus took off behind me and seeing no roving gangs of three and a dog, I reverted the bag to self-propel mode and took off for home: the big complex in the middle of five slightly smaller complexes called Indigo Village.\nThe stars were probably out. I had no idea, though, since the light from the Village prevented any see-through. Plus the permanent haze created by the daily movements of thousands of jet propelled conveyances, toys, conveniences, and assorted other things kept anybody from ever seeing anything, day or night. The permanent gloom in Indigo Village and elsewhere stank of the primitive fossil fuel exhaust as well. After the pure, rare air of Shap, it was particularly difficult to endure.\nSeems odd to escape back to this dive, but the Shaps had been giving me the creeps. I'd been experiencing a fit of unshakable nostalgia for about a week and been needing to get home. Truth be told, I had business to take care of. The fit about the hair was just a final straw sort of thing.\nMy work on Shap was cake for the most part. Practically everybody in security off planet has a cake walk. Shap isn't the only heaven out there. Most of the planets don't even need us. They all have advanced civilizations. The odd thing about advanced civilization is that once they're advanced enough to be a threat, almost by definition they're not. Like it's an unwritten law of the universe that if a civilization gains nuclear fire power, it also gains enlightenment. Everyone knows it, but nobody says it out loud. Least of all people like Tucker, my boss, owner of a diplomacy corporation, the type that ensure peace on any of its contract worlds.\nTucker and people with connections, power, and media access like hers, keep the paranoia back home boiling. \"We need to keep our vacspace safe,\" they like to say. \"You just can't imagine what a power hungry culture with fast spaceships and curious aliens could do to our lovely and vulnerable Earth.\" As if Earth has remained the pristine planet it was back in the twentieth century.\nSo Tucker gave me the Shap assignment. I spent my days sending back reports on the various moods (or should I say \"mood\") of the Shaps, the lay of the land, what we could do if they ever decided to attack, which no Shap in their right mind would ever consider doing because they were basically a happy people. Tucker never reported that happy shit though. And even if she had, nobody would have heard it. Everyone back at Tucker Central was too busy scanning and planning over the Shap high tech med facilities, their central intelligence think tanks, and the heart-beating centers of their civilizations. The Tucker Enterprise command big dogs rubbed their hands in glee over their main points of interest on the Shap globe, waiting for the day the natives stepped over the line.\nMaybe I was bored by the clean air and general contentedness of Shap. I needed a little jazzing maybe. Maybe that's why I did my hair. Maybe I was scared. Then again maybe I just needed to get laid.\nI walked down Target through the outer complexes where several all-night parties showcased the swing and play of the Earth-bound\u2014the people here that made it happen. A bottle crashed onto the cement just ahead of me. Loud, beatless music careened from the strobe-lit windows of the fourth floor. People came and went, the outdoor elevator never stopping. Over by the side wall, crouching behind a scraggly shrub for some semblance of cover, a couple tangled in an excuse for lovemaking. They grappled and clung more than swayed and embraced.\nI moved on, entering the inner complex where somewhere on the far side with a view of the courtyard me and my true love, Bell, had a love nest. Bell was an artist: sensitive, always saddened at my extended leaves from planet Earth to bring home the bread. Over-the-top talented, he could never hold down the standard dishwashing job others of his like mind seemed capable of. He was what he was and he provided the flavor in the life of someone who had a job in diplomacy, a fairly tedious occupation. I was mad about him.\nToo late I saw the duo with the brickbat. They raised their weapon and I immediately dropped my hold on the stowaway baggage before I got a chance to place it in \"manual.\" They'd have an easy time of it now. It was my first mistake of the trip. The bag was a goner for sure. God I hated this place.\nFor a few moments I listened to them whooping and hollering as they effortlessly guided my bag down the side alley, then I ran into the complex, not wanting to hang around when they discovered nothing but the ballast inside. People like those two get mad when they come up empty handed. And let's not forget about the brickbat.\nI hated losing that bag; it was my best effort, even if it was just another front for urchins with dogs or blunt objects. I'd owned this stowaway for five years now. The bag symbolized everything for me. Bell had given it to me and it had provided me with five years' uninterrupted luck. Now what was going to happen? My luck had run out.\nI turned my thoughts to Bell, the anchor in my ever-switching career. Without Bell, I'd have had no centralized lodestone, no magnet drawing me home. Indeed he was my comfort and my reason for existence. Bell and that bag represented my whole life. Without Bell, I would have jettisoned off Earth, this used up, burnt out pit of thieves, sin, and daytime TV programming, long ago. Earth was pass\u00e9 as far as I was concerned, but Bell loved it, thrived in its rich-with-dirt atmosphere. He was an artist and needed the stimulation.\nMe? I needed a clear view like the citizens of Shap had, but that was a problem. Shap was a little too predictable, a little too clear, sane and safe. I liked the people there, to be sure. My contact, Cam, was affable, polite. Cam even supported a nascent sense of humor, but in the end, Cam was not much different from the rest. Cam didn't even have a gender. Just like the rest.\nThe air of Shap was superb: a clear 20\/80 mix of O2\/N2 and everywhere infused with a native perfume so delicate of fragrance, one didn't notice it so much as miss it when it wasn't there. A combination of locust and chamomile blossoms laced with orange flower water quivering over a half-strength damask base might describe it. And it was everywhere you went.\nCrime? Non-existent. Shame, jealousy, fear, sloth\u2014all bred out of the native Shap's consitution. They were flawless, except for that one little flaw: they were all alike. And did I mention not a single one of them had noticed my hair? As if it was impolite to comment on another's appearance. Any differences were regarded as imperfections. But even so, why didn't Cam at least say something? We were buddies, working together every day for almost six Earth months. And I'd done it purportedly in respect for their year-end celebration. I'd done it for the people of Shap to show them I was with them in their celebratory spirit. I liked them and wanted them to know it.\n\"Bell, I'm home,\" I called as I stepped inside the apartment. A strainer full of unshelved dishes sat in the sterilizer bin. Art projects consisting of cardboard and Styrofoam sculptures, half-glued, half-shaped, and utterly formless, lay strewn about the floor and table and every horizontal surface in the room. Gobs of paste or glue dripped down from counter to floor. The whole room was a Salvador Dali project.\nThe sight got my blood racing just like in the old days. Like last weekend. It recalled Bell's intensity, his never ending energy, his ability to go hot and cold instantly, to explode, surprise, and change, to execute, to stimulate. I remembered last weekend and all the last weekends in an instant and it made my heart break.\n\"Back here, Hon,\" Bell called with half a heart. He'd been sleeping I supposed.\nI stepped over the various projects through the hallway and up to the bedroom where Bell lay naked under the covers. His black hair was disheveled and stuck to one side of his sheet-embossed face. His chest sagged slightly as he sat up. Had he aged since last weekend's torrid love-making?\nI flopped down onto the bed next to him and he clamped a hand on my shoulder, \"Good to see you, Sweetie,\" he said. \"Nice hair color.\"\nI heaved a sigh, didn't bother to lean over for a kiss. I looked at his hand on my shoulder and a tear fell upon it.\nHe sat upright. Surprised. Shocked even. I shocked the shocker.\n\"What's wrong,\" he said.\n\"They stole my stowaway baggage,\" I said and closed my eyes to kiss his hand.\n\"Did they get anything?\"\n\"Rocks.\"\n\"So what then?\"\n\"That baggage was my good luck.\"\n\"Not much luck if it got stolen.\"\n\"Yeah,\" I said.\n\"You know if you would stop trying to surprise me, I could meet you at the bubblemac and escort you home.\"\n\"But then I couldn't surprise you.\"\n\"Why are you crying?\" he asked again.\nI sucked in a deep breath of stale bedroom air and sank back into his chest. I fit comfortably as I knew I would. I dropped another tear and answered, \"Nobody noticed my hair.\"\n\"I noticed it.\"\n\"You're an Earthling, you're trained.\"\n\"So who else matters?\"\n\"Everyone.\"\n\"Why?\" he asked. I noticed he didn't put his arm around my shoulder, like he would have. Like he should have.\n\"Because it's my home now, it's where I live.\"\n\"For now.\"\n\"For good.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"I'm talking about the text message you sent to Tucker. You thought you sent to Tucker, mid-week remember? A Freudian slip sent it to me instead. Very flowery language you use. I recognize the day-after similes. I even pulled up the mailbox I'd saved. Same exact phrasing and rhyme scheme. Bell, the genius artist, has run out of ideas. I'm not so hurt as I am appalled. I threw a fit and dyed my hair and now I'm going home since I've delivered my final love message to you. I have a thing about breaking up in person.\"\nBell said nothing as he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed. The sheet stuck between his thighs and twisted around in the bed behind him. I knew he'd say nothing. They become predictable once you figure them out.\n\"I'll come back for my stuff in a month or so,\" I said. \"I have to get back for a celebration for which I purportedly dyed my hair, but nobody noticed. So you see why I'm crying. I did it for them, and none of them noticed. They're my people now. It's sad.\"\nI stood up from the bed and walked to the bedroom door. Turning there, I said, \"I'm leaving here for a safer shore. Safer and cleaner, but rather boring. No surprises, but maybe that's better. Maybe that's what I want.\"\nBell said nothing, too shocked to retort. I shocked the shocker.\nLater, after the return shunt had deposited me on the hub and I'd taken the worm tube to Shap's first moon and was now on the rocket shuttle for the planet itself, I retrieved my text messages. I was in a rotten mood, having accepted my fate as a cuckold and a mover from excitement to safety. I'd rectified my mind in regards to Shap, but I remained unsure. It was a beautiful, aesthetically pure planet. No heartbreaking going on here, but no heart throbbing either. It'd be like growing up, I guess. Not so much old age as maturity. Now I could relax and sustain, instead of fight and move.\nMy text messages contained the expected apology from Bell, short, poignant and utterly empty. The man was all pompous artistry with nary an original phrase in his body. What did I ever see in him?\nThe rest of the messages were work-related. Directions from Tucker (who had no idea she was the next one on the list to get the shove-off from me), festival schedules of events, places I needed to be and when, and one last, lone message from Cam, my buddy. My other in this planet of others.\nIt was a quick message. All it said was: \"Forgot to mention, I like your new hair color.\"\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Sue Lange.

Here is a sterile white room without windows. Ventilation shafts line the ceiling. The building breathes through them. The walls have a rubbery texture; the dimpled surface is pliant to the touch. Soundproof.\n'Didn't think many married men came here,' Byron says. 'Especially if they have a family.' There are children in the photograph \u2013 two girls \u2013 and Byron correctly assumes they are Nathan's daughters. 'Why are you here?'\nNathan looks at the door through which they are expected to go. It is white. There is no handle. A speaker is in the wall next to it. 'For the money.'\n'I know that,' Byron says. 'I meant why? You don't look like a guy who might need\u2014'\n'Everyone needs money.'\n'That's for sure,' Byron says. He rummages in his pocket and comes up with a package of Beeman's chewing gum. He offers a piece to Nathan, who declines. Folding the stick of gum under his tongue, Byron says, 'I lost my job back in '14. Government only helps so much.'\nNathan ignores Byron's lament. Inside the closed folder, the photograph seems to smoulder.\n'What do you do?' Byron asks.\nThe time worn question. Nathan hates it. 'I'm a teacher,' he says, then corrects himself. 'I was a teacher.'\n'A teacher?' Byron is incredulous. 'I didn't think educated folks ever fell on hard times. What happened?'\nNathan says nothing. It's not that he doesn't want to explain, but he wonders if he can.\n'Nate?'\n'I don't know what happened,' Nathan lies.\nByron nods. 'I guess it comes down to a matter of survival. Looking after what's important.' He chews his gum. 'You still married?'\n'No,' Nathan says.\n'Divorced?'\n'My wife died.'\nByron winces. 'Oh.' He sounds as if the wind has been knocked out of him. 'Sorry.'\nNathan reaches into the breast pocket of his shirt and finds a pack of cigarettes. He shakes one out, lights it with a battered Zippo and exhales a whispery cloud of smoke.\nThe speaker on the wall emits an audible snap. Nathan and Byron share a moment of trepidation. There is a flat hum in the air. Then a voice says, 'Byron James Allen, Identification Number 11-23853-2, report.' The speaker emits a breathy sound before going silent.\nThe door whispers open.\nByron stands and says, 'Guess that's me.'\nNathan feels he should offer something. 'Good luck,' he says.\nByron turns toward the door. As he walks through, Nathan looks at the folder in his lap, wondering if he's doing the right thing.\nIt was a warm October afternoon and Nathan was standing in the University Lecture Hall, staring at a sea of intrigued faces. He had been pacing in his usual manner, gesturing enthusiastically, believing everything in his lecture.\n'What you have to understand,' Nathan was saying, 'is that while morality can be more easily defined, ethics are questionable. Morals are reflective of individuals whereas ethics are the responsibility of groups. But ethics can be difficult when a government is concerned with the protection of the state.'\nA hand came up. 'But . . . professor Winston . . . isn't the government made up of individuals? Shouldn't there be a morality inherent in government?'\nThe student's face was familiar. Unkempt black hair, blue eyes behind round lenses, a thin goatee. Nathan scanned the student list on the monitor beside him. Names ticked past until he saw the one he wanted. Hayes, Charles, I (Chuck).\n'That simplified thinking, Chuck,' Nathan said. At the back of the hall a door opened, letting in a pair of men in nondescript brown suits. 'Once individuals come together in pursuit of a higher purpose \u2013 government, country or military \u2013 individuality must be surrendered. If it isn't, the state can't look after its own with any control.'\nNathan's eyes darted to the men in the back of the room. He said, 'You have to remember one thing: individuals are concerned with their own welfare. The scope of a larger body \u2013 our government, for example \u2013 is much broader. They are looking out for all of us. They can't always be expected to follow the same rules as individuals.'\nBefore Nathan could continue, the end-of-period bell rang. The students gathered their things. Nathan spoke above the clamour, reminding them of an upcoming exam. As he did so, the two men approached.\n'Mr. Winston?' the taller of the two asked.\nNathan nodded. 'That's right.' He walked toward the doors marked by a bright neon exit sign. Something uneasy settled in his belly.\n'We need to talk to you,' the second man said.\n'Talk while I walk,' Nathan said. 'I have a class in fifteen minutes.'\n'It's about your wife,' the taller man said.\nThe intercom activates with a dry snap. Nathan is looking at the folder in his hands, examining the way his sweat has blotched its edges. He imagines leaving the room, listening to the whisper of his feet on the floor. There is a trash bin on the curb outside the building; he can almost see the folder dropping inside, taking the forms bearing Nathan's straggling script, swallowing up the photograph of his past. You don't have to be here, he thinks.\nOn the heels of that: where can I go?\nHe knows why he's here. He's here because it's the last place left for a man whose life exists only in memory.\nHe gets the sense that someone is on the other end of the intercom listening to his thoughts. Paranoia.\n'Nathan Mark Winston, Identification Number 75-56192-4 (2), report,' says the disembodied voice. The intercom falls silent.\nThis is your last chance, he thinks.\nWhen the door opens, Nathan gets to his feet and walks into the room beyond.\nThe room has the personality of an administrator. The floor is hardwood and the walls teak. Nathan sits in a wingback chair. There is no one else in the room; the large desk sits like a ghost ship, captain and crew forgotten. Framed degrees hang on the walls.\nThere is a door behind the desk and two surveillance cameras in the corners. Dark glass eyes stare at Nathan. He stares back, thinking about the men who are watching him. He can imagine them gathered in a dim room, faces bathed in the light of the video monitors, guns and batons and restraints hanging on leather belts.\nAfter a few minutes the door behind the desk opens and a man in a tan suit steps into the room. He is middle-aged, trim, officious. He sits behind the desk, setting a folder on the blotter in front of him. He says, 'Sorry to keep you waiting.'\n'That's fine,' Nathan says, hating himself for being polite.\n'My name's John Noen,' the man says. 'I'm the facility administrator.'\n'Are you a doctor?' Nathan has noticed the degrees on the wall.\nJohn nods. 'I have a PhD in psychology but I no longer practice.'\nNathan falls silent. Talking is a trap. Nathan fixes his gaze on Noen's tie and remains silent. John Noen looks at the contents of the folder. As he does so he removes a pair of glasses from his breast pocket and puts them on.\n'Nathan Winston,' he says. 'You have a doctorate in political education and English.' Raising his head he asks, 'Do you have your forms?'\nNathan hands over the manila folder. Noen opens it and removes the pages. He makes notations with a red pen. 'Just a few questions,' he says. 'I want to make sure everything is in order.'\nHe stares at Nathan. Nathan's eyes dart to the video cameras.\n'You taught at the University for twelve years,' Noen says.\n'Almost,' Nathan replies. 'They let me go before I could finish my last year.'\nNoen marks the page in front of him. 'You were let go at the request of the University board and the Minister of Education. Correct?'\nAnger cinches Nathan's chest. 'That's right.'\n'Your teaching credentials were revoked.' Noen shuffles the pages. 'You didn't challenge the dismissal?'\n'What's the point?' Nathan asks. 'I know how the system works. I was wrongfully dismissed. But I had no options. Accepting the dismissal was the best thing to do.'\nNoen asks: 'You do know that you're Listed?'\nListed.\nThe Department of Homeland Affairs keeps the List. Though compiled by the government and paid for by the citizens, the List isn't in the public domain. Nathan's name is locked in a database somewhere, floating like an embryo. If his name is entered into any computer, red flags rise. Nathan Winston is potentially disloyal and his attitudes and behaviours are potentially harmful to the security of the state. At present, he is Listed as Class 2, which means he can be considered for retraining.\n'I know,' Nathan replies.\n'You've declined retraining. Why?'\n'I told you before,' Nathan says. 'I know how the system works. What I know can't be retrained out of existence.'\n'You were released from your job because you were declared to be disloyal to the state and its people. Wilfully spreading propaganda in opposition to your teaching and the laws of the country.'\n'What's the point of this? I thought you had questions for me. You're doing nothing but rehashing my . . . r\u00e9sum\u00e9.'\nNoen says, 'You're aware that Listed people are . . . discretionary? It's up to me to accept their application for assistance.' He leans back in his chair and pauses. 'Frankly,' he continues, 'I don't know why you're here. You have other avenues, Mr. Winston.'\n'The truth,' Nathan says.\n'Excuse me?'\n'I know the truth, Mr. Noen. I know the government. The body is weak. It's falling apart but no one knows it yet. Can you train me to think otherwise?'\nFor the first time Noen's cool demeanour flickers.\n'You're a part of that body, Mr. Winston. Perhaps it's the unhealthy parts that make the body weak.'\n'That isn't the case,' Nathan replies. 'And you know it. I'm interested in truth. Retraining, re-education, reapplication for my teaching credentials . . . none of that will bring me truth.'\n'You think there's an absolute truth, Mr. Winston?' The smile remains tacked on Noen's face. 'Isn't that rather arrogant?'\n'The government taught me to believe in absolute truth,' Nathan replies. He sees the smile on Noen's face waver. 'There may be no absolute truth. But there are lies.'\nNoen sniffs derisively and looks into the folder. He removes the photograph clipped to the inside of the folder.\n'Your family?'\nA blade touches Nathan's heart. 'Yes,' he says.\n'A family is a whole,' Noen recites softly, 'and you are a part of that whole.' He sets the photograph down. 'Your daughters were placed in the protection of the state because you were an alcoholic.'\n'My daughters were killed,' Nathan says. 'They called it an accident. Just like my wife.'\nThe smile flees Noen's face, replaced by a mask of condolence. 'Please,' he says, 'tell me about your wife.'\nNathan has convinced himself that he never had a wife. He tries to remember as little as he can but her face haunts his dreams. It is like the ghosts of his past: his job, his office, his home, his life. But a ghost with meaning.\n'What do you want to know?' Bitterness oozes between his words. 'How we met? Our first kiss? I don't remember any of that because it was built on sand. I didn't know it then but I was trying to make something whole out of bits and pieces that didn't fit.' Noen is frowning now. He doesn't like Nathan's tone. 'Let me tell you about my wife, Dr. Noen. I'll tell you what I do remember.'\nThere was a spray of blood on the wall by the elevators. It had dried into a crazy Rorschach pattern that wavered before Nathan's eyes. Behind him, the two men in brown suits took him by the elbows. Neither had spoken a word since driving Nathan to Memorial Hospital. One of them spoke now.\n'We should wait, Mr. Winston,' he said. 'Someone will be here in a moment.'\nThe moment passed with excruciating slowness. Men in white uniforms and paper boots were stringing yellow crime scene tape across the hallway. Nathan looked at the congealing puddles of blood and felt a gorge rising in his throat. He turned his head and saw the elevator doors open, spilling out three chuckling doctors. They barely glanced toward the carnage beyond the sagging yellow tape.\n'Mr. Winston!' A short and rotund man approached, a swollen-cheeked face floating above a neat blue suit. 'You had a pleasant ride over?'\nIgnoring the question, Nathan asked, 'What's happened to my wife?'\nHis eyes drifted to the bloody fan on the wall again. Seeing the smiling bureaucrat in his blue suit did little to alleviate Nathan's fear. Professionalism and courage under all conditions is important in a leader, no matter whom he leads. Nathan had recited that time and time again to his classes.\n'I'm afraid there's been an accident.' The smile slipped a little.\n'Is it Marie?' He grabbed the man by the front of his suit. 'What happened?'\n'Mr. Winston,' the man said, 'just come with me and I can explain. There's no need for\u2014 '\nNathan bolted down the hallway. The yellow crime scene tape snapped and floated lazily to the floor. He leaped over the muddy pools of blood, aware of the goggling stares of the crime scene technicians. His feet slapped against the floor as he ran around the corner at the end of the hallway and found out what had happened to his wife.\n'They hadn't even covered her up,' Nathan says. 'She was lying in the middle of the hallway, throat torn open. I could see her eyes. I see them every time I try to sleep.'\nDr. Noen's silence infuriates Nathan.\n'There were men standing there, smoking cigarettes, making jokes. Suddenly they're staring at me like I don't belong. Men like you, Dr. Noen, who hadn't had the decency to throw a blanket over my dead wife.'\nA page whispers as Noen turns it. '\"Marie Winston, wrongful death occurring at place of employment.\"' Raising his eyes, he blinks at Nathan. 'She was killed by a deranged prisoner who had been taken to the hospital for a routine exam.'\n'She was killed by the government,' Nathan responds. 'By its incompetence. By its lack of humanity.'\n'Not so, Mr. Winston,' Noen says. 'The patient, Donald Moore, had been in custody for three months. He was a combatant man with a history of violence.'\nDonald R. Moore, Detainee\nArrested on charges of vagrancy and resisting reintegration. Trial judge recommended re-education in detention centre for a period of six to nine years. Detainee demonstrates combative tendencies. Struggles with authority figures point toward a propensity for violence.\nTransferred to Memorial Hospital for surgical re-education and reintegration.\n'You do know what re-education through surgery means, don't you?' Nathan asks. 'They were going to lobotomize him. He was a frightened man living on the streets. A man no different from me. I was lucky enough to be educated. But I know how close I've come to being the man who killed my wife. I sometimes imagine what I might do if I were in his place.'\n'He was a criminal, Mr. Winston. And he was punished accordingly. You were given justice. Yet you turned on the very institutions that worked to protect you.'\nNathan had tried to convince himself that justice had been served. He had harboured rage for the man who had murdered his wife. But then he had discovered the man's true crime and realized that what he wanted wasn't justice but vengeance. The poor man had reacted like a caged animal. Even later on, when the nights had been numbed by alcohol and sleep, Nathan had found out that the man had been unrestrained despite his own threats. Marie had been placed in front of a human animal with nowhere to go.\n'They didn't protect my wife,' Nathan whispers.\n'You blamed everyone else for what happened in the wake of your wife's accident. You began to drink. You abused your position at the University by spouting long-dead rhetoric that\u2014 '\n'The truth,' Nathan says.\n'Your drinking led to the removal of your children into the care of the state. It was bad enough that your drinking led to their fate, but you lost your job as well.'\n'They killed my wife and kids,' Nathan says. 'You see that, don't you?'\nNoen leans back in his chair. 'An individual is responsible for itself and others, Mr. Winston. The others are the members of a household, a community, a country. Responsibility requires strength. You suffered terribly when your children were lost\u2014 '\n'They weren't a set of keys,' Nathan said. 'They weren't lost. They were killed. The state put them in a run-down child care facility that didn't meet one of three-dozen standards. They burned to death in their beds. Did you know that? Restrained in their beds because they had tried to run home.'\nNoen closes the folder. 'I had hoped to convince you that you still had an economically viable position in society. But a weak man always blames others. You blame everyone but yourself. Someone else caused the death of your wife. Someone else caused you to drink yourself out of your family and your job. Someone else killed your children. None of it lies on your shoulders.' Noen clasps his hands together and says, 'It must be nice to be free of responsibility.'\n'I'm not free of responsibility,' Nathan says, getting to his feet. He puts one hand on Noen's desktop. 'All of this is my own fault. I was so blind in the beginning that I couldn't save my family.'\n'You play the victim,' Noen says. 'You chose self-pity and\u2014 '\nNathan brings a fist down on the desktop. The framed photograph of Noen's family falls over. Nathan shouts, 'Can't you see that one is connected to the other? Of all people, you should know that. We make our choices, but sometimes we have help.' Nathan chokes, unable to remember what he wants to say. Collapsing into the wing-backed chair, he draws a shuddering breath and says, 'I'm sorry.'\n'I'm sorry, too, Mr. Winston,' Noen says, his voice filled with disgust. Without another word he removes Nathan's application form from the folder and looks at it.\nWhile Nathan watches, Dr. Noen stamps the word Accepted across the bottom of the page.\nAfter the dry, emotionless air of Noen's office, Nathan finds the quiet solitude of this room comforting. The walls are white; the ceiling and floor are a pale winter blue. Something hums faintly, just out of sight, enhancing the calm of the room's quiet colours.\nAside from the chair in which Nathan sits, there is little in the room. A bare counter juts away from one wall. In the centre of the room is a glimmering metal table. Next to it is a small metal stool.\nA door opens and someone enters the room. This someone is tall and gangly, with a shock of white hair. He is wearing a white body suit, lab smock and latex gloves.\n'Good afternoon, Mr. Winston,' he says. 'I'm Dr. Flutey. I hope you're comfortable.' He removes a thin silver book from beneath the counter. He hands the volume to Nathan and says, 'You can take a few minutes to look this over and make a decision.' Nathan says, 'I've already completed the forms and\u2014 '\n'I know. But you need to be sure. This is a big decision.'\nFlutey fills a syringe with a green fluid that makes Nathan think of coastal waters in places he's never seen. His eyes close. He can see the slowly lapping green water and the sun, sinking like a memory beyond the curving slope of the world. He can hear the soft sound of the waves and the shrill cry of birds as they wheel across the turquoise sky.\n'Mr. Winston?'\nNathan's eyes open. 'Hmm?'\n'There isn't a problem, is there?' The doctor cocks his head. 'I was told that you were distressed earlier and\u2014 '\nNathan closes the book. 'I'm fine. And I've already made my decision.' He points to the thin manila folder that Dr. Flutey brought into the room. 'It's in there.'\nDr. Flutey takes the book in one gloved hand and places it beneath the counter. He faces Nathan again.\n'Remove your shirt, please.'\nAs Nathan unbuttons his shirt, his fingers betray him by trembling. Telling himself he isn't afraid \u2013 he can't be afraid, he's lost more than he's about to lose today \u2013 he finishes removing his shirt and sets it aside. Dr. Flutey directs him to the stool next to the table.\nParts of a whole, Nathan thinks. Individuals are parts of a greater whole. The society they create is that whole. And parts of that society are what create the greater body of government and state. Every part is important and cannot be forgotten. But remember: not every part is necessary.\n'Mr. Winston,' Dr. Flutey says, 'place your forearm on the blue line.' The doctor points to the surface of the table, as if Nathan might not see the thick blue mark before him. He lays his forearm on the line, feeling the cool whisper of steel against his flesh.\n'This will feel cold,' Dr. Flutey warns. In his hand he holds a silver aerosol can. He depresses the nozzle and a white cloud of gas erupts from the canister. It coats Nathan's arm within a few short moments. To Nathan it feels as if his forearm has been immersed in a bucket of ice water. His skin tingles and he can see the hairs on his arm beading with condensation. Within a few moments the sensation passes, leaving only numbness.\nDr. Flutey picks up the syringe. 'This is a sedative,' he says. 'It isn't required, but sometimes it helps.'\nThinking of his wife, her staring eyes, Nathan says, 'No.'\nDr. Flutey sets the needle aside. Nathan closes his eyes for a moment and sees the soft green waters of another life. Another world. When he opens them Dr. Flutey is standing on the opposite side of the table, scrutinizing a row of switches on the wall. He says nothing as he raises the first switch. Nathan feels a great pressure pulling his arm against the table. His numb flesh can barely feel it. He can see the hairs on his arms disappear, however, as a tremendous force pulls them free.\n'Did that hurt?' Dr. Flutey asks.\n'No,' Nathan says. 'I barely felt it.'\n'Let's just be certain.' The doctor produces a needle and, while Nathan watches, punctures his arm in three separate places. Blood beads. There is no pain.\n'Very good.'\nDr. Flutey turns back to the row of switches on the wall. 'You're doing the right thing,' he says. 'You need to be viable in society, Mr. Winston. In any way you can. Remember: we can do amazing things with medicine now. Society thanks you.'\nNathan can think of nothing to say.\nWith his finger touching a switch on the wall, Dr. Flutey says, 'You may not wish to watch. You'll feel nothing, but . . . it might be disturbing.'\nNathan rivets his eyes to his forearm.\nThe switch is thrown and Nathan hears a faint whisper. Beneath him, the table vibrates softly; he can feel it in his shoulder and neck. There is no sensation in his forearm. He tries to imagine what it would be like if he could feel.\n'Mr. Winston?'\nNathan ignores the doctor and watches as the whirring object rises from the tabletop.\n'Mr. Winston?'\nIt spins rapidly, dividing the air, nothing more than a hazy blur.\nThe blade is virtually silent.\nYou're doing the right thing.\nYou need to be viable in society.\nNathan remembers the listing in the book. Third page, fourth line, the type dark and neat and empty of thought, wisdom or emotion.\nRight forearm, Severance Pay: $25,000\nSociety thanks you.\nIn the time that it takes, Nathan wonders about many things.\nHe wonders about his wife, about what she might have thought in the last moments of her life. He wonders about his daughters, restrained in their beds. He wonders if there is a place with green water and warm sunshine where nothing like this is necessary. He wonders if a man can build a house on sand and survive.\nHe wonders if there will be a lot of blood.\nHe wonders if it will hurt afterward. Is it true what they say? Will he wake up in the night, trying to scratch a non-existent itch on a limb that is no longer there?\nEvery part is important and cannot be forgotten.\nNathan wonders if he can learn to write with his left hand.\nHe figures he can.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Shane Nelson.

Perhaps the couple in the apartment above had just arrived home to greet each other with a kiss. The elevator shafts murmured down the hall, but the doors never opened. Cannon lay on his back and waited for the noises in the wall to get louder, for them to arrive at his front door. Not quite paralyzed, he listened to the hurried rhythm of his chest rising and falling, and wondered if DNA had any control over the entry and escape of air from his lungs. DNA seemed to have little control over anything these last few hours. Cannon could be content without this answer, lying in wait for his death.\nHe imagined strands and nodes spinning and unwinding and doubling themselves. Incomplete, simple pictures he'd been asked to grasp when he was a child. His thoughts dizzied him. He felt as if he'd tumbled through the mattress and resurfaced, whirring elevators and knocking on the walls echoing through daydreams that brought no good answers.\nDearest Etruria,\nYesterday, he was only making a simple stop at the bank to deposit a check. Some poor bastard, a man trying to determine the tenth anniversary gift for his wife, chatted up his teller. She responded as someone in customer service would \u2013 friendly, supportive, unmoved by his nervousness.\nHead down, trying to avoid contact with the man beside him, Cannon filled in the date on the deposit slip. Wrote down his name and address. 'See, see I know there's this whole format, and you give your wife this on the first anniversary, like paper, and you give her this other thing on the fifth, but I'm not romantic. I've never been romantic.' The teller's giggle carried through the room. With his back to them, Cannon imagined her nodding her head in sympathy. 'I want to do something out of the ordinary. And I've got all those fears of what her past boyfriends did for her. Isn't that dumb? Most guys are better at this than I am.'\n'I wouldn't say that,' she said.\n'I just don't want her to think I'm pathetic.'\n'Well, hopefully she finds you romantically pathetic or pathetically romantic.'\nThis was not a voice Cannon knew, but he turned to look at her. She was far from him. Several windows down in the cavern of the cold, grey-white marble and brass room. Beyond lines of slumping heads trapped between snaking velvet ropes, beyond the nervous man with a patch of bald skin standing before her, she smiled behind the glass and swath of industrial light glaring over half her face. Full lips. Thinner body. Wider, shorter teeth. Her hair raven's ink, the thick strands drawn from the careful, wide strokes of a brush.\nNo, this wasn't Mike's fault. Cannon never should have stopped to look. The teller took her attention away from the customer long enough to find Cannon watching. He'd never seen this woman before. They'd never spoken. But he knew her, and he knew that she knew he recognized her.\nI don't want to be with anyone else. I'm not interested in anyone else. I love you. I know that would have been so much better if I'd told you in person. I'll tell you as many times as you want the next time I see you. I hope that you already know that by now and my actions have been enough to show that I love you, and you've been thinking why won't he just say it? Forgive me if it hasn't been obvious. Forgive me if it has, and you've been waiting on me to get over myself.\n'There's no harm if you go and introduce yourself.' Mike grinned and handed Cannon two beers. 'I usually see her drinking this after work.'\nShe had been Mike's suggestion. Cannon needed to get off his lonely ass and find himself a woman. Mike always had her in mind. Studied her for a while and thought she was a sweet enough girl Cannon wouldn't find intimidating. The party had been the setup. Mike invited them both, knowing that Cannon would never refuse approaching her since Mike had gone through so much work and scheming. If she thought Cannon clumsy, she kept it to herself.\nThey were crammed in Mike's studio apartment with little room for privacy. Mike's bed, the couch, the short space between kitchen and bathroom had all been taken. Cannon beckoned her over to the view down on the street, a group of square, brick apartment buildings directly across from them. He leaned against the radiator, the small of his back pressed against the window sill. He said nothing to her and just handed her the beer. She thanked him and reached for his hand.\n'Etruria,' she said.\nHer firm grip calmed him, and he returned the handshake. He'd heard that name before, even though it was by no means usual. 'Etruria,' he said. 'Etruria . . . '\nA little embarrassed, she shrugged. 'Like the ancient civilization. My parents liked their history.'\n'Ahhhhhhh, I understand. People are always wondering why I'm named after a weapon. My mother wanted to honor her family. All the Cannons were dying out, and she was pretty sure I was the only child she'd have.'\n'Was she right?'\n'Besides the miscarriages.' He closed his eyes and rolled them up into his head. He heard the beer lurch forward in the bottle as she took another drink. 'That's, that's probably more \u2013 '\n'Don't worry about it,' she said.\nHe opened his eyes.\nMike was wrong about one thing. Cannon should have found Etruria intimidating. For someone in her early twenties, she knew what she wanted without being controlling or too demanding. Cannon was five years her senior, and he still fumbled for a purpose as he approached thirty. Every one of her movements had purpose. No glance, no smile, no slight shift of her weight was made without an intended meaning. He was satisfied sometimes to just watch Etruria move. The way she smoothed her skirt over her knee when she crossed her legs. How she'd frown in the mirror and press down errant honey blond strands with her middle and index fingers before she left for work. When he was down, she'd walk across the room and brush him under the chin with the back of her hand. Sometimes, when Cannon hid his face in her hair, and she wrapped her body around his, he wondered why she chose him. She was more deserving of a confident man, one she didn't have to encourage every day, one who didn't fumble for words when she could tell him everything she wanted him to know just by entering a room.\nI'm not good at this. I never have been. I'm afraid telling you all this is going to push you away, but I'm yours as long as you'll have me.\nHe didn't go back to work after he left the bank. He went straight to his apartment and locked himself in. Huddled himself on the floor against the couch facing the door. After dusk increased the shadows down the hallways and on the walls, Cannon didn't turn on any lights. A TV conversation mumbled through the ceiling, and he confused it with his own inner dialogue. He sat on the floor of the den squeezing his chin between his knees and told himself that what he had heard was mere coincidence. He misread the look from the teller in the strange, fluorescent light. It was the fluorescent light. He misread the teller. Misread the teller in the strange, fluorescent light, he repeated until he descended into a comforting hypnosis.\nThe phone rang. In his cocoon, Cannon heard each pulse rise from his subconscious. The phone stopped, then suddenly rang twice, and went silent. Cannon yelped and found he wasn't breathing. The same ringing pattern used to draw him to the phone when the caller knew he was too weary to be bothered speaking with anyone else.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut. One ring, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight . . . she was persistent, and still he hadn't picked up. Nine, ten, eleven . . .\nHe took the receiver, and the surge of vomit he knew would come was quickly replaced by airiness. He floated up to the ceiling. His gut stopped trembling. The low drone in his head dissipated until his imaginations imploded in a vacuum.\n'Cannon?'\nThey both listened to his heavy breaths beating against the phone. He mouthed several sentences and bit the tip of his tongue.\n'You don't have to be afraid, Cannon.'\nThe voice was unfamiliar, but for the caress in the inflection. The soft, deliberate enunciation of hard consonants. Strong, assured, but still laid back.\nCannon clenched his teeth. His shoulders bucked, and his body spasmed back and forth. He couldn't pretend he didn't know. She wouldn't let him. He rubbed his hand across his face and through his hair. He was surprised it was so wet. 'What's your name now? Is it still . . . the same?\n'My name is Leeanna now, Cannon.'\n'I don't believe in reincarnation. It hasn't been long enough for you to grow up and have a whole new life anyway.'\n'I haven't been reincarnated.'\n'Then . . . ? You are, you are Etruria?'\n'I just took another shell.'\nCannon shook his head. 'Shell . . . ' Her voice, the warmth on the other end of the phone, invaded the hollow spaces in the apartment. She was on top of him, like her body heat used to slowly push him into the mattress when she laced her leg on top of his and eased her head and breasts onto his chest.\n'I finally got a body, after thousands of years. We're meant to have a body, you know. Without living in one . . . I'll spare you. I won't try to explain that kind of pain.'\nHis stupid, scared laughter wracked his body. 'Thousand of years? So, you've just been, like some kind of ghost? Where did you get her body? You took Etruria's body?'\n'There was no her, Cannon. Without another spirit living in it, the body was always mine. It took a while, but they finally figured how to make a human body.'\n'What're you talking about? Clones? Nobody's made human clones. It's illegal.'\n'You're so trusting. I always found that sweet.'\n'Did you take Etruria's identity too?'\n'I am Etruria, Cannon. Even when I have to live as Leeanna, I'm still Etruria. You knew it when you looked at me. Whoever owned the original body, she's been dead for years. Forgotten. Why would I take a copy of someone who's still living?' She laughed to herself, and Cannon's thighs quivered. 'They still haven't figured out you can't recreate the spirit or the soul. The clones wouldn't even move without us in them,' she said. 'They'd expect me to act like her, to think like her. I'll never take a copy of the living. I have no interest in being someone else. I'm very, very sorry you had to see me today.'\n'Etru . . . Leeanna. Leeanna. Leeanna . . . I wouldn't bother telling anyone. They wouldn't believe me.'\n'I'm sure you mean that, Cannon, but funny things we never intend always happen. I can't wander without a shell again.'\nHe had let her down, as he knew he would. He was too tired to make a run to the store with her and whined about it as he wormed his way back under the sheets. She patted his head and told him she'd bring him some fudge.\nThe police called, and he spent the rest of the night holding Etruria's hand. He breathed in time with the respirator, as if this could rouse her, heal the fractures and the damage on the inside. For a moment, he wondered if he would be the one lying there if he had been driving and not responded quickly enough when the other car swerved into the lane. But he couldn't imagine the fear or the rapid onset of pain on impact. He told himself that to do so would be self-righteous, making himself believe he could be empathetic, after he should have gone with her in the first place.\nWhen she died, the only person Cannon knew to call was Mike. Etruria never mentioned any family, had no family. He let Mike call the rest of her friends.\nI don't know why you stay with me, Etruria. I don't know why you find me good enough to be with you. I never want to disappoint you. That's the worst thing I could ever do to you. If I ever have please forgive me.\nMike thought the letter was a bad idea. Too cheesy, too desperate; Etruria had no reason to believe Cannon was insecure about the relationship. But Mike didn't understand. Cannon could never want another woman, and he knew of no other way to express it. He stood there and watched her read it at the dining room table in candle light. She had jumped into his arms and whispered, 'It's romantically pathetic, or pathetically romantic.'\nAfter the call last night, he had only to wait for her. He got up from the bed and approached the front door with bare feet, avoiding the creaky floorboards. He stared at her through the eyehole, and she stared into him on the other side. The dark hair and thinner face made her look harder. He liked rubbing his nose against the baby fat of her cheeks, letting thin lines of blond hair get caught in the crease between his lips. The hair on this new body looked like it could cut the skin. Maybe he couldn't kiss that mouth. It was too full, too round. If she had occupied this clone when he met her, Cannon probably never would have loved Etruria. But he met her several years too early.\n'Cannon, you're there aren't you?'\nMike would have told him to run \u2013 it was possible to get away. Maybe that was true, but Cannon knew he could not outlast the wrath of wandering spirits. If Etruria didn't do it herself, someone else would find him, would keep him from stumbling with their secret.\nHe opened the door for her, and she smiled for him. He kept his distance, and she backed him down the dark hallway. Through the den, past the kitchen, past the living room and the bathroom. It was the game they used to play. Her leading him. Him giving up the chase as they collapsed onto the bed. He tried to imagine thinner lips and soft cheeks. The shadows helped. He could pretend they had blackened her hair. Over the past twenty-four hours, he questioned why she chose this body. Did she watch clones grow up in tubes? Some quiet, expressionless faces showing more promise than the others? Or was it that she looked so different from the shell she had before?\nThe backs of his knees hit the edge of the bed, and his legs buckled. Forced under his falling weight, he sat abruptly, but Etruria didn't pounce on top of him. She gave him the same look as she used to when she found him staring out, listening to the muted sounds dancing in the walls, thinking about why his life had never been more interesting than this.\nNow he understood why she had stayed with him. He was never a threat. 'Where are they hiding them? Where are they doing the experiments? Will they clone me? Who'd choose to clone me? It'll be easy to forget me. Somebody will take my shell and start over, won't they? Can I get a copy, or will I be out there drifting? Do I have to fight for a shell? How many shells are there? There's not enough \u2013 there can't be enough. How badly does it hurt without a body? How long will I have to wander without one? I'd never tell. I know they don't know what you, your kind's doing. Teach me how to act like I'm the same as the original. I can learn how to fool them, too. Can I get a copy and be with you?'\nShe pressed her index finger against his lips, and he knew what would come next, her sticking the tip of her finger in his mouth. He allowed his teeth to nibble. For his tongue to search. Very different skin. Very different taste. He took her finger and kissed it, sucked it, and let it fall.\n'With everything you've ever seen, you must find me pretty simple.' She didn't respond to his embarrassed laughter. 'Did you ever love me?'\n'You'll always be special to me, Cannon. If you don't find any rest, don't come looking for Leeanna. I'll have to choose another shell when I'm done. Living without a body is the only prison I ever wish to experience.'\nShe cleaned the tears from his cheeks with her palms. He didn't know what would happen once he was torn from this body. But he knew Etruria, and she had always done what was right for him. He knew she had certainly chosen the best way for him to die.\nStory Copyright \u00a9 2007 by Toiya Kristen Finley.

E. Lester\nPlanets\nEveryone knows what a planet is. Or at least so we thought until last year. For the last 76 years we have had nine planets in our solar system; every schoolchild has learnt this as an absolute fact. But the truth is that there has never been a precise definition of exactly what a planet is.\nThe new category created by the IAU is Dwarf Planet. Like Planets, these must also meet the first two criteria above but not the third. Pluto falls into this new category, as do Ceres (in the asteroid belt) and Eris (the Trans-Neptunian body initially known as 2003 UB313, and informally as \"Xena\").\nSo now everyone knows we have just eight planets. But this is not exactly true, or at least not if you are willing to look outside the Earth's own Solar System, and consider Exoplanets (or Extrasolar Planets).\nIn fact just over a month before the IAU removed Pluto's planetary status, the count of planets orbiting other stars had reached 200 with an announcement in The Astrophysical Journal (July 20, 2006) of five new Extrasolar Planets.\nThe History of Exoplanet Detection\nAstronomers have been looking for planets orbiting other stars since the mid-nineteenth century, but all claims of planets orbiting stars including 70 Ophiuchi and Barnard's Star, all having been later shown to be due to observational errors.\nAll this changed in the late 1980s, or the early 1990s depending upon your point of view. 1988 saw a group of Canadian Astronomers (Campbell, Walker and Yang) make a rather cautious announcement of an Extrasolar Planet orbiting around Gamma Cephei (Alrai). Their announcement met with a sceptical response from the astronomical world, mainly due to the fact that the observations had been made at the very limit of the equipment being used. In fact, it wasn't until 2003 when improved technology and techniques confirmed the team's original results.\nSo although the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei was the first to be announced, the long delay until its confirmation effectively handed the honour of the first detection over to two other astronomers - Canadian Dale Frail and Pole Aleksander Wolszczan. In 1992 they discovered two planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12. This was confirmed in short order, and so mankind had conclusively discovered a planet orbiting another star.\nThis discovery was not entirely expected. PSR 1257+12 is a pulsar - a type of star previously not considered a candidate for having planets. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars, the remnants of supernovas. It had previously been believed that such stellar explosions would destroy any planets in orbit around the star.\nThree years after this, in October 1995, the first discovery of a planet around a main sequence star was made. Two astronomers (Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz) of the University of Geneva detected a planet around 51 Pegasi, a very Sun-like star fifty light years from Earth.\nThis planet, 51 Pegasi b (these planets are designated in order of detection, not distance from the parent star - with the letter \"a\" reserved for the parent star) is not a likely candidate for life, however. Like the other early Extrasolar Planets detected it is a large world (in our solar system it would be a close second to Jupiter in terms of size) and it orbits very close to its star causing it to have a high surface temperature around 1200 degrees Centigrade. It has been given the informal nickname \"Bellerophon\".\nMethods of Detection\nCampbell, Walker and Yang's 1988 detection was made using a technique known as Radial Velocity (or the Doppler Effect). By analysing the Doppler Shifts in the spectral lines emitted by the star, slight variations in the speed (relative to Earth) can be detected. Variations like this can only be explained due to the gravitational effects of other celestial bodies and the technique has, so far, proven the most productive of all the Extrasolar Planet detection methods.\nMayor and Queloz used a technique known as Pulsar Timing Variations to discover their planets. Pulsars emit extremely regular radio waves as they rotate. Variations in the frequency of these emissions can be proven to be the effect of orbiting planets.\nOver the years, as technology has improved, new techniques have been developed and there are now many methods of detecting Extrasolar Planets.\nWhen one star is directly in front of a more distant star from the perspective of an observer on Earth, the gravitational field of the front star can act like a lens, causing the far star to be magnified. Any planets orbiting the nearer star can be detected due to their effect on this magnification.\nAstrometry is the technique of measuring the exact position and path of movement of a star, and examining the movement for perturbations caused by gravity fields from nearby planets.\nPeriodic variations in the brightness of stars can be proven to be due to planets passing in front of the star (from our point of view), obscuring some of the light and causing the star to appear dimmer. If this dimming happens regularly, the only cause is an orbiting body.\nA further technique involves analysing disks of dust surrounding stars. These disks absorb some of the star's light, and then re-emit this energy as infrared radiation. Features in these disks can suggest the presence of planetary sized bodies.\nThe Chances of Life\nThe majority of Exoplanets detected thus far have been orbiting Sun-like stars. A main reason for this is that one goal of the work is to discover an Earth-like world, so programmes have been concentrating on similar stars.\nHowever, there is also good reason to concentrate on these stars. Large stars (tens of times larger than our Sun) emit so much radiation that they inhibit planetary formation. Smaller dwarf stars are believed less likely to have planets, and it is generally believed that these planets will be smaller than current detection methods can discover. Given that planets have now been detected around multiple star binary systems (another environment thought not to be likely homes to planets) this narrowness of search may well need to be expanded.\nAlthough the majority of the search is concentrated on Sun-like stars, our currently available technology and detection methods are not capable of finding other Earths out there. Up to February 2007 the vast majority of the 200+ discovered Exoplanets are Gas Giants, often greater in size and mass than Jupiter.\nThis is to be expected, for these will produce much greater anomalies than rocky planets could. The smallest Exoplanet discovered orbiting a main sequence star is OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb. At a mere 5.5 times the mass of the Earth, it orbits its parent star at 2.6 times the Earth-Sun distance. As the majority of Extrasolar Planets orbit very close to their star, this makes this body the most Earth-like world we know about.\nSo what do these discoveries mean for the chances of life out there? They do prove that planetary formation is not uncommon. There are a number of other criteria that are believed to be necessary for life to develop. But given the fact that planets are being detected that are comparable to the size of Earth, orbiting similar stars to our own Sun at Earth-like distances, the chances are looking good.\nArticle Copyright \u00a9 2007 by I.
