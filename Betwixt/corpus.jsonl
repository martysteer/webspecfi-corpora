The corn screams\u2014kind of a thin piping whisper\u2014but the moonshine that Braz distills from it\u2019s just fine. It\u2019s got this kind of oily ripple going, nothing more.\nAnd it\u2019s our drink. You\u2019re going to come here, you\u2019ve gotta respect that.\nIn Siltown, your first drink at the bar\u2019s always moonshine.\n* * *\nBoneslush is sharp and murky. It\u2019s part fermented goat\u2019s milk, halfway to cheese. We\u2019ve still got goats in Siltown. Only us locals eat their meat, but their milk doesn\u2019t seem to do anyone any harm.\nYou can barter for cheese. It doesn\u2019t have the same kick as boneslush, but it\u2019s edible and it keeps well. You don\u2019t get that at the bar, though. Besides whatever you and Braz haggle for the price of boneslush, you gotta hand over a bone. A small one. Usually a hand or toe bone, but teeth are okay too. Braz\u2019ll drop it in the jar she\u2019s serving the boneslush in and mix it with a long steel nail, then hand it over.\nNo one\u2019s ever found the bone in the bottom of the jar.\nJust remember that the bone\u2019s gotta come from family that bore you no ill will.\n* * *\nGriefbark\u2019s a kind of tea, made from the thorns and bark of those godawful brambles that crawl through the ground and around the buildings. It\u2019s a bloody bright red, translucent and sour. Old Sandy goes on about how the brambles used to be raspberry bushes, and griefbark\u2019s the colour of raspberry juice. Nobody cares.\nIf you\u2019ve wept or slept in the last day you can\u2019t keep it down, and it\u2019s too bitter to hold in your mouth long. It\u2019s a good challenge; whoever spits their mouthful out first loses. Makes a lot more sense than seeing who can hold their hand in a candle longest.\nIf you do keep griefbark down, people\u2019ll leave you in peace to cry yourself to sleep. If you aren\u2019t local, you\u2019ll wake up in a corner of the bar with a blanket over you.\nGenerally you\u2019ll be okay, although if it\u2019s been a bad month I\u2019m not promising someone won\u2019t have gone through your pockets.\n* * *\nPotatoes are pretty nearly as tough as goats, and they keep better than corn. The first year, we just used them for cooking. But then people started travelling again, and coming through town, and that\u2019s when we figured out that it\u2019s just our corn that screams.\nWe also figured out too much moonshine don\u2019t sit well with people who aren\u2019t from Siltown.\nSo after the first shot, Braz\u2019ll bring you potato vodka unless you ask for griefbark or boneslush. It\u2019s not really our thing, though some of us use it for disinfectant or fuel. In a pinch.\n* * *\nCorn coffee isn\u2019t real coffee; no one in Siltown\u2019s seen coffee in years. Old Sandy keeps comparing it to chickory coffee. We grind up the corn, and roast it, and brew it into this gritty dark drink that\u2019s . . . well, it\u2019s real invigorating.\nYou\u2019ve been on the road, right? You know it can get pretty rough now.\nCorn coffee makes us fast and tough enough we get to make sure we\u2019re left in peace.\nWord gets out, I guess. Someone tried to steal some once. Got behind the bar while we were dealing with his friends.\nHe\u2019d have been better off ordering boneslush and handing over the bone of a stranger. That would have been over.\nBraz keeps him in the bar cellar. She says she\u2019s working on something new, mixing blood and milk. The goat\u2019s milk is fine; the problem is the blood from the thing in the basement keeps sublimating.\nShe\u2019s collecting it like you do water with an evaporation still. Says it\u2019s this kinda sooty mass, and she just needs to figure out exactly how to get it to mix with milk instead of clumping.\nShe\u2019ll have a new drink for us to try real soon.\nFrances Rowat lives with her husband, their dog, and a not-quite-startling number of cats. She spends most of her time at a keyboard, and enjoys knitting, jigsaws, and postapocalyptic fiction. She would like to thank coffee for existing, her extremely patient family for support, and her writing group for Wednesdays.\nSupport Betwixt | Buy this issue","source":"http:\/\/betwixtmagazine.com\/five-drinks-in-siltown-by-frances-rowat\/","source-hostname":"Betwixt Magazine","excerpt":null,"filename":".\/scrape\/jsonfiles\/HmUkaQmE0pCWlOs04t+FBuT8s2M.json","has_text":true}
{"fingerprint":"ayYhEiYHyQb-We6+kPOeGyKeZnI","title":"The Red Danube","author":"Bernie Mojzes","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"By the time the river fruits, it is far, far too late.\nBefore the river fruits, the clean, white sand of \u0160trand swarms with bathers: young women in skimpy bikinis, old men in Speedos, families, the laughter of children playing in the gentle, blue waters of the Danube River. Lovers holding hands in the sun. Music from a hundred competing radios.\nThe porn star slathers sunblock on her skin. She rubs it onto her face, especially liberal with her nose and ears, the tops of her feet, the back of her ankles. She lifts long, black hair to rub lotion on her neck, pulls up the legs of her thin, cotton pants to coat her calves and thighs. Spreads it on her belly and chest under her T-shirt. She does her arms last, not forgetting the backs of her hands. Her cousin gets her back and shoulders.\nStill, she knows even with the sunblock and the T-shirt over her bikini, with her skin, she\u2019s going to burn. But it feels so fucking good to be out from under the spotlight and standing in real sunlight, with real sand burning her feet. Just one anonymous person in a sea of anonymous people at the beach on a beautiful early summer day. Some things feel so good that it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of hell you\u2019ll have to pay later.\nThree boys have been watching her, whispering to each other, passing around a smartphone. Is it bad that she can no longer tell if people are old enough to watch her films? For all she knows, these kids are older than she was the first time she spread her legs for a camera. They approach, nudging one of their number ahead.\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he says, in English. \u201cI am sorry to disturb, please. But my friends, me. We.\u201d He gestures at his friends. One of them waves nervously. \u201cWe are big fans.\u201d\nThe porn star has a love\/hate relationship with the internet. Right now it\u2019s tipping toward hate.\nFrom the corner of her eye, she sees her bodyguard lean forward on his beach chair. But he won\u2019t intervene unless it\u2019s necessary.\nShe looks at her cousin. \u201cWhat is he saying?\u201d she asks in Croatian. The press knows her father is Serbian, but not that her mother is Croatian, or that she is native-fluent in three languages and can get by in four others. Some things are private.\nHer cousin answers in Serbian. \u201cHe says he is a fan.\u201d She shrugs. Rolls her eyes and taps her temple.\nStill in Croatian, the porn star tells the boy that if he wants to meet girls, he should come up with a better line.\nShe shoulders past the boys and goes to the river\u2019s edge. She hears their muttered debate behind her. Eventually, they go back to their towels. Who says porn stars can\u2019t act?\nThe river is cool. The sand is soft under her feet, and the water eddies around her ankles.\nA child runs by, squealing, splashing water up her leg. His older sister runs after him, screaming just as loudly.\nAcross the river is Fru\u0161ka Gora, which sounds to the porn star more like a soda for Gwar fans than a mountain. At the foot of the mountain, where it meets the Danube, is the town of Kamenica, and Kameni\u010dki Park: a dark forest, bisected by the bridge from Novi Sad. Her father used to vacation in Kamenica, taking the train with his friends, practicing their American accents. Kay-ma-nence.\nComing to \u0160trand was a stupid idea.\nFuck it. She pulls off her T-shirt, steps out of her pants, and swims far out into the Danube, past the buoy markers, until the sounds of humanity fade, and the current threatens to wash her away.\nThis is the porn star in her dressing room: standing in front of the mirror, robe open and dropped to her elbows, draping the small of her back. Her breasts are white triangles on a red background, bull\u2019s-eyed and crosshaired in pink and silver. She stands stiffly, like it hurts to move. It does.\nThis is the makeup artist: frowning, and muttering merde under her breath as she dabs pale makeup on the hot, red flesh. It\u2019s a fucking nightmare. They\u2019re shooting in half an hour. Tomorrow, maybe the day after, the sunburned skin will start peeling off in sheets, but right now she\u2019s just trying not to break the blisters.\nThis is the first director: throwing open the door with enough force that the doorstop splinters the wood, raising his hands in disbelief. Gripping the porn star by her chin and turning her face toward his.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d His breath smells like stale slivovics and cheap tobacco. He holds up a photo of her, autographed in silver ink. \u201cThis! This is you\u2014pure, unblemished, alabaster. Porcelain. Perfect, like a fucking angel. Not red and peeling and full of pus. Nobody buys your films to see the devil.\u201d He wipes his hand on the makeup artist\u2019s shirt. \u201cWe can\u2019t film today. We can\u2019t film for a week. Fuck!\u201d\nAs he storms out of the dressing room, he adds, \u201cAnd shave, for Christ\u2019s sake. You look like a damned monkey.\u201d He doesn\u2019t close the door behind him.\nThe porn star hears the first director cursing and shouting, hears the other two directors, muttering. She goes to the door, hands on the doorframe, robe still hanging open.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is so angelic about \u2018white and hairless\u2019?\u201d she screams.\nHis response is as vivid as it is long, and doesn\u2019t answer her question.\nThis is the film that will never be: one part Bu\u00f1uel, one part Fellini. Equal parts Tinto and Tarantino, to taste. A dash of Ang Lee and a pinch of Jarmusch, and a handful of other influences the porn star doesn\u2019t recognize stirred in\u2014Balkan and Muslim filmmakers, most likely. And a fair amount of fucking. It\u2019s a kaleidoscope, a collision of styles, just as the three directors are: the Serbian pornographer, the Bosnian Muslim feminist documentarian, and the Croatian war correspondent. Like the Balkans themselves: fractured and reassembled like a dozen Humpty Dumptys dropped and shoved back on the supermarket shelf.\nIt\u2019s a dangerous film, one sure to inspire death threats, and perhaps worse, against the directors and cast. They were all forewarned. The porn star signed on without hesitation, even though she had just announced her retirement.\nThe film would span three wars\u2014World War II, the Balkan Wars of the \u201990s, and a future war of terrorists and counterterrorists\u2014the scenes cut and pasted against each other in a ruthless antinarrative that spared no one. She would be Josip Broz Tito, heroic leader of the Partisan rebels fighting Nazis and unifying the country. She would be a Bosnian Muslim girl, raped by Serbian soldiers, tortured by Croatian intelligence agents, and murdered by her own family. She would be an American interrogation specialist faced with impossible choices.\nThe cast was impressive. Real actors, for the most part, not just the same revolving set of Industry cunts and cocks. Many had seen the peak of their careers come and go, but the porn star would not have kicked them off the set for eating cookies, as they say. One of them alone would have been enough to get her to sign on. Best Pirate EVAH! she had posted online, once upon a time when she was still just a girl, so long ago that it hurts to remember.\nIn the film that would never be, he is an SS officer, and she his prisoner. In the midst of an interrogation, she would escape and turn the tables, taking him from behind with a strap-on. And the rumors that the explicit shots were done with a body double? Totally false.\nIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit what a total fangirl she was\u2014still is\u2014but on the other hand, it\u2019s good to know she\u2019s not completely jaded.\nAll this is public record, posted to the porn star\u2019s blog, after the quarantine.\nFor three days during a brutally cold January, back in 1942, Hungarian occupying forces massacred over twelve hundred people in Novi Sad, mostly Jews and Serbs, and other undesirables. In what would become one of the most notorious single acts in the Balkans in World War II, the Hungarian army marched 550 Jewish and 292 Serbian civilians, entire families, onto the frozen Danube. And then broke the ice with mortar rounds.\nSeventy-odd years later, after the river fruits near the site of this atrocity, after the public health advisories and the quarantine, after it is already far, far too late, there are rumors of conspiracy: it was the Jews, the jihadists, the neo-Nazis, the Chinese. The Iraqis or the Iranians. God. A hundred others.\nThe rumors are false.\nWhen the porn star\u2019s body is once again pure, pristine, alabaster, a fucking angel, they shoot the first sex scene, in a thirteenth-century monastery on the southeast side of the mountain.\nShe is an interrogator, doing what she knows is right and necessary, and utterly reprehensible. She has become a monster, shunning the other soldiers, the other interrogators, everyone who supports what she\u2019s doing. The sight of people sickens her; she has smashed all the mirrors in her small apartment. Her time is spent with her prisoners, and herself.\nTraining for her other scenes, the porn star has learned exactly how to hurt people. This is so she can do the scene without actually hurting them. She finds she likes taking it far enough that her costars aren\u2019t sure she\u2019ll stop in time. She tells herself she\u2019s doing it for the art. To help the other actors get into character, into the scene. Enhancing verisimilitude. She writes that in her diary to add the weight of ink to the words, as if that could make them true.\nWhen the prisoner\u2019s priest comes to beg news for the prisoner\u2019s family, the interrogator studies the man.\n\u201cWould you like to see him?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you give?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you like, that I can give. Anything.\u201d\nShe\u2019s been alone a long time. Years, for the character; since she retired, for the porn star. The prisoners don\u2019t count, any more than her bodyguard counts; they aren\u2019t really people, which makes them both better and worse than everyone she knows. The interrogator\u2019s lips curl into a cruel smile; she reaches out to trace the curve of his mouth with fingers that have drawn screams from others.\nThe priest\u2019s eyes widen. He swallows; a shiver runs through his body. You can see it, even though these parts of the film, the future war, are captured on cell phone cameras, handheld video recorders, disposable point-and-shoots. You can see it, even though the film is grainy, jumpy\u2014the scenes as much collage as montage. You can see it, even in the still shots.\nHer partner is not an actor. He is one of the monks from the monastery. The decision to go through with this, to forsake his vows for what promises to be the most important film of his generation, is as difficult for him as it is for the character he plays. When he kneels between her legs on the ancient stone floor, he isn\u2019t acting\u2014the anguish and desire in his eyes are real.\nIt\u2019s the hottest scene she\u2019s ever done, in a lifetime of scenes, and she comes hard, fingers knotted in his thick, curly hair.\nShe wants more, wants to push him onto his back and climb on top of him. She wants to take him against his protests, take what virtue he has left, even though it\u2019s not in the script. Even though it isn\u2019t what he agreed to.\nInstead, she pushes him away, and shudders with self-loathing. She isn\u2019t acting, either.\n\u201cCut,\u201d the first director says, \u201cand wrap.\u201d\nThe third director, the journalist, grips the cameraman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cKeep filming,\u201d he says, softly.\nThe monk wipes his mouth as he turns his face away. The porn star bursts into tears.\nThey are still in the monastery on the mountain when bubbles of red and brown the size of marbles and golf balls rise from the river bottom to burst on the surface. The slimy patches of color drift like bloody water lilies with the river\u2019s current; the spores go where the wind takes them.\nThe beach at \u0160trand is closed.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter; these bubbles have been rising for weeks, though before they were only the size of amoebas, of the period at the end of this sentence, of fucking angels dancing on the head of a pin, and went unnoticed.\nThough the first and third directors are happy with the way the scene is going, the second director is unsatisfied. The porn star doesn\u2019t look scared enough, and she keeps forgetting, moaning like it\u2019s a porno. The men don\u2019t look cruel enough. They are too gentle. Too respectful. The rape scene is entirely too erotic. Filmed direct to videotape on vintage equipment, it needs only a bad soundtrack to be a complete mockery.\nThis is not fiction for the second director: it happened to her, during the war, the real war. Not in an ornate chapel filled with icons of saints in vibrant colors and gold leaf but in her mosque in the poorest part of Mostar, and there was nothing fucking erotic about it.\nShe kicks the other directors off the set. \u201cThis is my rape,\u201d she tells them. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to have a say.\u201d\nShe takes the porn star aside, and they speak for a long time. Exactly what is said is not recorded, not blogged, but whatever it is, when everyone is dressed and they start again, the porn star fights back.\nWhen she is grabbed, a heavy hand on her shoulder, she slashes at the man with car keys, raising three bloody welts under his eye. He pins her wrist. She bites his arm. His blood fills her mouth.\nMomentarily free, she turns to run.\nAnother man stands in her way.\nShe kicks him hard, in the balls, and when he doubles over, she smashes his face into her knee. Blood sprays from his broken nose.\nThe first man grabs her hair. \u201cFucking psycho cunt!\u201d He slams her face into the stone wall. Her lip blossoms; one of her teeth chips. She staggers back. His fist is huge; it blackens her eye and sends her sprawling.\nThe second man, recovering, kicks her in the gut, in the ribs.\nThey fall on the porn star, then, tearing at her clothes. And they are not gentle. And they are not respectful. And there is nothing fucking erotic about it.\nShe deserves this, she thinks, as her face slides in rhythm with the thrusts across the blood-slick stone. She deserves this for what she did to the monk. And what she wanted to do to him.\nAn eternity later, when the scene is done, one of men crawls off to puke against the wall. The second director sits, curled, fetal, rocking, in the corner, and everyone who can find an excuse to leave has. The other directors are let back into the chapel. The first director runs to the porn star as she towels off the come and blood. She winces away as he reaches for her bruised face.\n\u201cWhat have they done to you?\u201d he cries. \u201cMy sweet angel. Now how can we film?\u201d\nThe porn star runs her tongue across her cracked tooth. Grimaces. Spits blood on the first director\u2019s shoes and shrugs. \u201cWe do the Nazi interrogation scene next. It\u2019ll save a fortune on makeup.\u201d\nOn the other side of the chapel, the third director glances at the footage. \u201cBrilliant,\u201d he says, as he captures the aftermath on his smartphone. \u201cFucking brilliant.\u201d\nThe porn star is a rainbow. Red and black, dark blue and purple. Green and yellow as gravity drags the bruises down her body. Her face and breasts and ribs, knees and elbows, the fingers of her right hand, all bruised and blackened. The shadow of fingers circle her throat. She has never hurt this much.\nThe World War II scenes are filmed in black and white, on a 1937 Bolex H-16. It keeps the bruises from looking too garish. She loves the sound of the shutter, of the film rolling. Real film, not tape, not pixels encoded in flash memory.\nThe scene with the man who had played her favorite pirate is a guaranteed crowd pleaser. A physical and moral victory. The good gal wins. And so what if the real Tito was never captured and tortured by Nazis, never escaped to sodomize his torturer? He also wasn\u2019t a girl with alabaster skin and pierced nipples. There are more truths to be found in history than mere facts can hold.\nIf the monk scene was damnation and the rape scene absolution, this scene is a palate cleanser, a wafer on the tongue with a mouthful of bad wine to wash away her sins.\nShe blogs about it that evening. It\u2019s the first post she\u2019s made since she retired, and it is full of mysterious and titillating hints. There\u2019s a sense of innocent elation in that post that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, and she doesn\u2019t mention the earlier scenes at all.\nThat comes later, after it becomes clear that this film will never be completed.\nThe second director leaves the suicide note on the porn star\u2019s dressing room table, apologizing for what she has put the porn star through, and for taking the coward\u2019s way out.\nThe thirteenth-century monastery is a small enough building, and there are no locks on the doors. The porn star runs from room to room, searching, praying she\u2019s not too late. Stopping to tell the others would just slow her down.\nThe porn star finds the second director in the bath. A cracked safety razor case lies in the sink, and the bath water is pink. There are three deep gashes up the second director\u2019s arm, none of them deadly. Her hand shakes so, and her arthritic thumb refuses to cooperate. The treacherous vein keeps slipping away under loose skin.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she says.\nBut the porn star does not. Instead, she takes the razor blade from trembling fingers and sets it next to the tub. She fetches a first aid kit, then removes her clothes and lowers herself into the blood-pink water. She inspects and washes the wounds, and binds them to stanch the bleeding.\nShe has never seen the second director naked. Never seen her less than fully clothed, long-sleeved shirts and scarves. Scars crisscross her arms and legs, some ancient, some fresh. Deeper, uglier scars pucker her belly, slice her breasts, bisect one of her nipples.\nThis is the second director\u2019s story, inscribed in bloody hieroglyphs upon her body. As painful as it is to watch that fragment of the film that will not be, we see in this flickering moment that the porn star\u2019s rendition is less than a pale shadow of the reality.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d the porn star says. \u201cI knew what I was signing on for. I chose this.\u201d\n\u201cThere is so much pain,\u201d the second director says. \u201cSo much ugliness in the world. How can anyone stand to live?\u201d\nThe porn star touches a red-tinged finger to the second director\u2019s lips, and then, tentatively, replaces it with her own lips. \u201cHow can we stand not to?\u201d she asks, as her hands explore the older woman\u2019s body, \u201cwhen there\u2019s still so much good to experience?\u201d\nLater, after their immediate needs are met, and the water cools, the second director studies the porn star\u2019s body.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cA bruise,\u201d the porn star says. \u201cNo shortage of those.\u201d She tries to laugh.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d The second director looks closer. There is a redness under the porn star\u2019s left breast. \u201cIt looks like a rash.\u201d\nThe third director steps from the shadows behind the linen closet. He is holding his handheld camcorder\u2014we can see him reflected in the mirror\u2014and he moves in to get a clearer shot.\nThe second director screams\u2014terror, not surprise or outrage. She flinches away and wraps her arms around her nakedness. The porn star steps from the bath, holding the razor blade.\n\u201cYou were here the whole time,\u201d she says, accusing. \u201cWhat the fuck kind of monster\u2014\u201d\nThe porn star\u2019s fingers are bloody on the blade. They slash out toward the camera. The third director cries out in pain. The view swings wildly, there is a splash of red across the lens, and the scene ends.\nThe rash is gone the next day.\nThey have the monastery for two weeks, and they finish the last scene on schedule, just barely, shooting at dawn\u2014the scene where the prisoner is smuggled out of prison and delivered to the priest, who is the monk, who cannot bring himself to look the porn star, who is the interrogator, in the eyes.\nThe next two weeks would have been hectic: five days shooting at Petrovaradin Fortress, across the river from Novi Sad, then a week in Novi Sad proper. Two battles are scheduled, and a scene where the porn star\/interrogator runs into the prisoner in a caf\u00e9. A scene where Tito gives a speech to an adoring public, after the war, and then personally executes a collaborator.\nScenes they will never film, from the film that will never be.\nThe porn star is in the third car in the caravan, an old Ford microvan that wheezes its way up the mountain. The first and second directors are with her. The third director is in the second car, after the first director shuts the microvan\u2019s door in his face.\n\u201cI\u2019m a pornographer,\u201d he says, idly fondling the makeup artist\u2019s breast. \u201cI treat the girls who work for me like objects. But I treat objects with more respect than he treats people.\u201d\nThe second director purses her lips. \u201cHe does not see people, or objects. He sees only ideas.\u201d\nThe porn star watches the first director\u2019s hand, teasing the makeup artist\u2019s nipple under her blouse. \u201cSome ideas are better than others,\u201d she says.\n\u201cNot to him. Ideas are only more or less useful.\u201d\nThe microvan stops at the foot of the mountain.\n\u201cWhy have we stopped?\u201d the first director asks.\nThe porn star sees the driver\u2019s head shake in the rearview mirror. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a blockade. The army is here.\u201d\nA man in a uniform gestures for them to turn around. The driver of the first car tries to get more information.\n\u201cThe road is closed. Go back where you came from.\u201d A mantra.\nThe third director is filming out the window of his car. When the army man sees this, he grabs the camera, throws it on the macadam, and smashes it with the butt of his rifle.\n\u201cThe road is closed,\u201d he says, again. \u201cGo back where you came from.\u201d\nThey try two other roads, but both times they meet roadblocks.\n\u201cThe road is closed. Go back where you came from.\u201d\nOne of the men recognizes the porn star. He approaches shyly and asks for an autograph. She finds a promotional photo for him, and then pauses, pen hovering.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get across the bridge, into Novi Sad,\u201d she says. \u201cCan you tell me how to get there?\u201d\nHe shakes his head. \u201cThe bridge is closed.\u201d\n\u201cWe have reservations,\u201d she says, and she names their hotel. \u201cWe\u2019re filming in Petrovaradinska tvrdjava. I could get you onto the set. . . .\u201d\nHe looks back at the other men. They\u2019re too far off to hear. \u201cThe bridges are closed. The hotels are closed. Novi Sad is closed.\u201d He raises his hands helplessly. \u201cEverything is closed.\u201d\nThe porn star thanks him, leans out the window and kisses him on the cheek.\nThey turn the cars around and head back to the monastery.\nThe porn star is a geek girl at heart. Before she had a career, she read cyberpunk novels and mucked around in other people\u2019s computers. And while her skills are years out of date, she still manages to get word out, however briefly, about the blockade, and the quarantine, and the news blackout, and the data filtering.\nAnd that\u2019s enough, really, to reestablish her street cred and get her all the help she needs.\nThe cover-up is not Serbian, and it is not European. It\u2019s global. But so are the resources that offer themselves to her.\nAnd so she tells what they know: there are roadblocks; there are helicopters. A few monks who manage to return to the monastery tell of a quarantine extending farther down the Danube River, and of people being taken away by men in hazmat suits.\nThe posts disappear in a few hours, but that\u2019s more than enough time. By then, they have been replicated all over the net. And soon enough it no longer matters whether anyone tries to suppress the news or not.\nThe bruising heals over time, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. The porn star is still a rainbow. But now the color isn\u2019t in her skin itself, but under it. Her skin is still alabaster, porcelain, pale and luminous, like a fucking angel. So translucent you can see the veins. And now, there\u2019s red and yellow and blue-green too, the tendrils tracing the paths of her nerves\u2014a bioluminescent filigree.\nThe day the second director first notices this, the thin lines spreading from under her left breast where the rash first appeared, down her ribs, and up to her armpit, the porn star starts posting about the film. She puts the entire script online, plus annotations and directors\u2019 notes. She uploads raw footage, the scenes we\u2019ve all seen in so many different forms. The first footage to go up is the scene with the monk, in all its myriad parts.\nThe chapel has become a set once again.\nThe porn star walks onto the set. She dances for the camera, for us. She strips. When they cut the lights, she continues to dance, a sensuous human jellyfish, glowing from within. When the dance is done, they upload the footage to the porn star\u2019s website.\nThey do this every night, and every night, the infection spreads.\nThe porn star is not the only one infected; everyone suffers from it: the cast, the crew, the directors.\nThough perhaps suffer isn\u2019t the best term. The fungus colonizes the myelin sheath; it doesn\u2019t hurt, though it modifies the signal in nondeterministic ways\u2014sometimes fuzzier, sometimes sharper, more intense. Pain might hurt more, or less, or differently. Pleasure, likewise. The extent of the colonization is less of a mystery than what it does. The luminous filigree lets everyone know, in no uncertain terms, where the nerves cluster most densely.\nOne tweet: Who knows, this might be a good thing. We\u2019ll see.\nAnother: Boys, my clit is a laser pointer. Now you have no excuse.\nThere is very little reliable information about the epidemic on the internet. The only data the porn star trusts is her own account. When the army begins distributing food, they refuse to give any information. But she finds fans there as well, and soon discovers the army has also been given as little information as possible. They have a job, and they do it.\nThe only thing the soldiers know for sure is the air filters they have been given haven\u2019t been effective. They\u2019re all in this together.\nIt is not hard to convince some of them to smuggle the film reels out.\nAnd she\u2019s right: the Nazi interrogation scene is a crowd pleaser.\nThe Balkans have always been a microcosm of the world, a dollhouse, a crucible in which everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and will go wrong again, and everything that could go right has gone right and will go right again, and in which every mix of good and evil and love and hate and avarice and generosity has been endlessly played out over the ages.\nWe take what she, what they have given us\u2014this script, these notes, these pieces of footage\u2014and we find in them all those things.\nOf the film that will never be, there is nothing but these fragments, these spores. We write essays and books, slash and media tie-ins. We add soundtracks and new scenes, and film the scenes that were never filmed in endless variations. We draw comics and paint cathedrals. Cut, edit, add, cut again. We mix and manipulate obsessively, until the film that will never be is transformed: the film that could have been, that will be, that is always becoming more.\nMore than anyone could ever watch.\nWe can trade notes, share our favorite scenes, our favorite versions. We can debate about more or less faithful renditions, and whether that even has any meaning.\nBut in the end, even in this infinite proliferation of versions and truths and meanings and interpretations, we still have that one scene, the last one, untouched and absolute. The one we all come back to, time and again. The one that strips away the words and leaves no room for any truth but itself.\nThe camera is already rolling as the porn star walks into the chapel. She\u2019s already nude. Her face is unreadable.\nShe gestures to bring the camera closer. \u201cLeave the lights up. We don\u2019t need the dark anymore.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true. She\u2019s glowing like a fucking angel about to ascend.\n\u201cTouch me,\u201d she says.\nEveryone is there. The cast, the crew, even the monks. They gather, but no one touches her. Her eyes settle on the makeup artist, and hesitantly, she reaches out. The porn star places the makeup artist\u2019s hand on her belly and holds it there, a minute, five, ten. Her eyes close and she lifts her face toward the vaulted ceiling. She smiles as if she\u2019s come home.\nWhen the makeup artist pulls away, the imprint of her hand shines brightly through the porn star\u2019s skin for a few moments, before fading.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of volunteers after that. Hands press her flesh, and the light follows. The cameraman films it all, and he has the camera trained on the porn star\u2019s face when she says, \u201cI can taste you.\u201d\nHer eyes open wide; she gasps and shudders.\nShe fruits.\nSoft and rubbery, the caps push through her flesh, and as the others shrink away, she falls to her knees.\nThe cameraman shoots close-ups as the growths split her skin, glistening nubs ranging from the size of a nipple to a fingertip.\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d the porn star asks, bleeding from a hundred wounds. \u201cPlease. Someone tell me what to do.\u201d\nEveryone looks away.\nBut then one figure moves close, takes her face in his hands.\nThe camera moves in for the close-up. The porn star stares at the monk as tears run down her face.\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is where it ends.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is where it begins.\u201d\nHe kisses her, and groans. His hands move down her body, and the nubs respond, rising against his palms.\nWhen he strips, there are fruiting nubs covering his pale flesh. And when she pulls him into her, the nubs twist and writhe around each other. They furrow into each other\u2019s flesh.\nThe first to join them is the second director. She strips in front of the camera and then lies beside the two. And it is not long before the porn star cries out, grips her lovers with fingers that dig deep into flesh, arches her back, and opens.\nHer body encompasses her lovers and spills out across the floor.\nThere are screams, of course, but they are background. In the foreground, the porn star, the monk, and the second director spread across the floor, their bodies melting, disassembling. Merging. The distinction between inside and outside becomes meaningless.\nThe screams fade, and the only sound comes from the pool of flesh on the stone floor.\nThe first director and the makeup artist look at each other. There is fear in that look, yes, and desire. And something more, something unreadable. Something I can\u2019t comprehend. Not yet\u2014but soon. Without words, they remove their clothing. They kiss, and then, holding hands, they step into the porn star\u2019s body, and are subsumed.\nOne of the actors follows, then two others, until they have all joined the glowing, angelic mass, and only the cameraman and the third director remain.\nAnd then the cameraman sets the camera on a tripod and joins the others.\nThe third director checks the connection between the camera and the computer, and between the computer and the internet, makes sure the data feed is uninterrupted. He stands at the edge of the porn star\u2019s rippling body, which laps at his toes.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mutters as he turns away. \u201cI should have helped.\u201d He sits against the wall and wraps his arms around his knees.\nThe angel on the floor turns a dozen eyes to face him, and then a single arm, an arm with three long and still-livid scars, reaches out, offering a welcoming hand.\nAnd then it is just the porn star, or the pool of flesh and fungus that had been the porn star, and the directors, the cast and crew, the monks. A kaleidoscope of bodies, of minds, ideas, cultures that can\u2019t possibly coexist.\nBut there they are, hour after hour, day after day, streamed across the internet, until the power fails, and the film that will never be ends.\nBernie Mojzes resides in a drab suburban neighborhood outside of Philadelphia with an improbable menagerie of creatures, some of which are neither human nor glass.

{"fingerprint":"TMjUCV3fSakvGl+6X7hh1mwEA0E","title":"A Map to Camelot","author":"Rose Biggin","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"On the Call to Adventure\nIt is not our place to ask why you have chosen to make this journey. If, of course, you made a choice at all. Many report that a feeling of longing urges them to set off, communicated from somewhere outside themselves in a language beyond words. Some travellers have more specific aims: glory or welfare or a change of scenery. Others, perhaps the most unfortunate, have the journey thrust upon them, by a disgruntled wizard, by losing a bet, or both.\nIn any case, the chance you will reach your destination is highly unlikely. We do not say this to adversely affect morale. On the contrary. Many travellers find the sensation of struggling against overwhelming odds to be a great stimulant.\nOn Saying Good-byes\nThere is no fixed method for this; we leave it to your discretion. Be aware that any last-minute pieces of advice offered in a whisper by friends, relations, tearful lovers, benign locals, and\/or anonymous passers-by are likely to be worth their weight in gold at some undefined point in the future.\nIt may be the case that you have no good-byes to say. If this is the situation, bid farewell to the trees. Again, we leave the exact wording and choice of formal bow up to you.\nIf you are setting off from a place with no visible trees, do not say good-bye to the wind or the rain or the clouds. They\u2019re all going with you.\nOn Packing\nIt is advisable that you only take what you need: food and water are essential, as are a pair of good dancing shoes for court. The judicious traveller may also wish to obtain\/acquire\/find themselves in possession of: a selection of favours, sleeves, and\/or handkerchiefs (for bargaining with cowardly and\/or lovesick knights); a full set of unicorn treats in assorted colours (should it be deemed necessary or desirable to gain the favour of such a beast while not disclosing private information regarding anyone\u2019s sex life); a working knowledge of local heraldry; a full set of wooden cutlery plus an additional bowl for guests; a quiver of arrows; a set of twine knots in different sizes; a back-up crossbow (for passing as an innocent hunting party should you be caught in Royal or otherwise privately owned woodland); spare verruca plasters (for acquiring Lake-based weaponry); a keen eye for the horizon (optional).\nOn Compass Points\nIt is not necessary to be able to tell true north from magnetic north. The difference is negligible and will not affect your journey.\nOn Starting Points\nBegin where you are. Then go anywhere else.\nThis is an instruction many travellers find difficult to follow, but it is worth it if you can and will save a lot of back-tracking later. Think of the route as being drawn on tracing paper, able to be placed wherever you are, and then you can sort of go from there, if you see what we mean. Tracing paper is a far better and more charismatic material than, say, a humble piece of dirty old parchment like this one. Speaking of which: where did you get it? You must have found it in a relative\u2019s abandoned attic, or hidden at the back of a treasure chest in the library, or beneath the little windmill at the miniature golf course where your cousin\u2019s best friend gives the balls out on Wednesdays, or in the safe behind the tasteless painting in your boss\u2019s office, or wherever else you found it. Surely nobody actually gave this to you? See below: On Riddles & Paradoxes.\nOn Sidekicks & Fellowships\nWhether it is necessary or desirable to have an acquaintance for this journey or whether it is better to travel alone is a matter much discussed. Really it depends on your aims. If you foster dreams of glittering knighthood it is always good to have a retinue who can stand nearby and clap, but if you want to draw on uncanny associations when you get there it will be much more dramatic to turn up alone. Remember, though, that not everyone gets to be a knight, and fear and suspicion go along with wonder and can easily be turned against you.\nLarger travelling parties make for fun and relaxing questing experiences if you can keep a lid on the endless storytelling competitions, but it is sometimes difficult to resolve who is in charge.\nOn Setting Off\nStart early.\nA nocturnal getaway may harbour some romantic attraction: you are not the first traveller to fantasise about stealing away in the dead of night. But in the dark it is all too easy to mistake every second shadow for a troupe of bandits or a night constable or a dragon with a headache or a sorcerer with a grudge or an enchanted tree with a face. It is dangerous to be walking at night along badly lit, hazardous roads, especially when you\u2019re shaky with adrenaline from the buzz of getting going. We recommend your party be en route shortly before dawn.\nWe realise that to some extent this suggestion is irrelevant, since you have no doubt set off already.\nOn Disguises\nDo not be ashamed or embarrassed to hide beneath the appearance of another. You might find it necessary to perform as somebody above or below your own social station, and may be required to continue this deception for many years. Sir Bandolever is our example of choice here.\nSir Bandolever is not included in many of the greatest poem cycles about your destination, but it is still a good idea to know a few facts of their history.\nSir Bandolever was a champion at the joust, mace, and sword, and put in a decent effort at fencing, squash, and cabaret events as well. Arriving at Camelot without any warning, it is no surprise they proceeded to make themselves indispensable. Sir Bandolever never gained immortality for questing, quest planning, or quest administration, but they were wise, or at least had acquired a reputation for wisdom, which is nine-tenths of the battle. It is rumoured that even Sir Galahad sought them out for advice. They say it was only because of Sir Bandolever\u2019s hints that Sir Gawain was able to capture a ruddy great crowbat that everyone thought had put a curse on the trellis in the herb garden. And so on.\nHowever, when people saw Sir Bandolever without their armour, people assumed that they were their own squire. Take heart from this story, and know that in Camelot it is entirely acceptable to live what many outsiders would consider a lie.\nOn Navigating Forest, Desert, and Sword Bridge\nThe Great Forest is where you are most likely to meet any unicorns and\/or dragons. Although it is (understandably) tempting to call a unicorn to you, generally speaking it is never quite as useful or glamourous as you think it\u2019s going to be. On no account interrupt a boar hunt.\nThe desert will not last as long as you think it will. Keep drinking water in small sips. Search discarded armour for jewellery, money, or anything else you may be able to trade at She\u2019spire Village. Although the view looks barren and harsh in its emptiness, take time to enjoy its majesty. They long for stories about this kind of sunset at court, where the stars do not twinkle half so much due to the incessant light pollution.\nSince it has been designated an Official Quest Point ever since Lancelot\u2019s Comeback Victory Tour, there is likely be a long queue to cross the Sword Bridge. Place a token or hire a squire to stand in your place, and take the opportunity to spend the time exploring the surroundings. Be sure to collect the watercolour engraving of yourself crossing the bridge to prove you did it, should any sceptical maidens or cynical pirates question your claim to this achievement. If you do not cross the Sword Bridge, cynical pirates can be placated by being beaten in a game of chess. If you can\u2019t play chess, cynical pirates also enjoy operatic duets along the themes of unrequited love, tragic romance, and misspent youth. Strangely, neither opera nor chess will placate a sceptical maiden.\nWhen it is your turn to cross the Sword Bridge, don\u2019t try to saunter over on foot in the manner you will see naive young scallywags attempting. Kneel and shuffle. There\u2019s no shame in it.\nShe\u2019spire Village\nIt may become necessary to seek employment during your stay in She\u2019spire, depending on whether you reach this village when you have just begun your journey or when you are bordering the outskirts of your destination. Many enjoy their time here so much they choose to stay. This is an entirely valid decision.\nBe sure to ask for Kate at the corner shop, as she is always willing to extend the deadline for buy-one-get-one-free offers and will turn a blind eye to best-before dates, which are all for show anyway.\nLeft at the Crakshaw Mountains\nThis item has been placed here deliberately to catch out those who would merely scan the main points of our argument, just as a devious cartographer will introduce a deliberate error into their work to prevent plagiarism by lazier mapmakers. We must make it clear, then, to those who are reading this carefully, that it is imperative that you do not go left at the Crakshaw Mountains. Going any other way will result in your eventually reaching the Broken Road, around the Wobbly Haze-Oasis, and thence directly to the suburbs by the castle grounds. Taking a left, however, will lead you through the mountain pass and along the remains of an avalanche and into a non-gobackable dead end with mould on, by which time you will have realised your mistake but it will be too late, and you will find yourself left at the Crakshaw Mountains.\nOn Duplicitous Castles\nCastles look forbidding in the distance\u2014especially if they are well fortified and prone to boiling oil\u2013based decor. But if you seek warmth, shelter, entertainment, or directions (we hope you will not by this stage in your perusal want for directions, but we understand that you may wish to seek out a second opinion from time to time) it is always worth knocking. But be wary of Castles that merely perform hospitality, while actually impeding your progress. Remember your ultimate destination and try not to be waylaid. See below, A Handy Metric for Gauging the Duplicity of Castles, including: Sprinkling of Seductive Lies, The; Tools Abetting Procrastination, Know Your; Fear Factor, The; and Leaps into the Unknown (Temptation to Avoid), Making Your First.\nA good rule of thumb: if too many people say they\u2019re so glad you\u2019re staying, look for the exit. But don\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re doing that. This is an occasion where it is advisable to steal away under cover of the night.\nGive ruins a chance. They have much to teach you. See if you can identify the cause of the ruin. If you discover an individual is responsible for the carnage, seek them out and ask if they can give you any hints.\nOn Achieving Success at the Fisher King\u2019s Arms Pub Quiz\nIt is forbidden to place a list of the answers here, but we can offer some advice: be on the lookout for double-, triple-, and quintuple-bluffs; multiple choice questions favour the second-least obvious; the circumference of the Round Table is measured in millimeters and calculated via the usual algebra; hawks and handsaws have the same collective noun; page thirty-four of the Livre de chasse; nobody knows; it was there all along; wheelbarrow.\nAlthough the Fisher King\u2019s Arms is the only place in the kingdom with access to full broadband rather than the dial-up ynternet under which the rest of the populace suffers, it is vital that you do not cheat. Spies and scabs will report you to the Round Table Complaints Dept. and your quest will be for nothing.\nOn Fighting Dragons\nKeep a gold coin in the bottom of your shoe, or in the bottom of a friend\u2019s shoe; in most places this will be enough to hire someone to do the fighting for you. Or else, run. This is why it is best that the heavy coin is not in your own shoe.\nOn Breaking Curses\nIn the unlikely event that you find yourself cursed, above all do not panic. Take deep, steady breaths and consider your options. Ask yourself: do you really feel cursed, or are you merely succumbing to the placebo illusion? Plenty of fraudulent sorcerers out there. Ask yourself if the magickal effect(s) you think you saw might not have been concocted manually, perhaps involving an intricate rope and pulley system; an accomplice hiding in the trees; a partially inflated balloon full of coloured dust; a secreted knitting needle; a dove or sparrow let loose at the operative moment from an overly embroidered sleeve; a cunning mishmash of various obsolete and sinister-sounding languages and a simple abcb rhyme scheme; centuries of superstition; or just having the confidence. Ask yourself how you might re-create a similar-appearing curse effect to frighten and disorientate your own enemies. Ask yourself: wasn\u2019t there something just a little bit, you know, off about the way they swooped their cape like that, almost as if there were strings attached or something?\nThese sorts of questions will serve to distract you while the curse takes full effect and you sink into oblivion.\nOn Not Getting Involved in Grail Quests\nWhen the knight first puts it to you, it may seem like a great opportunity: an acknowledgement of your skills, a useful means to get you in with the Round Table crowd. However, remember that these quests only ever lead away from your destination.\nOnce the negative answer has been given, do not rise to anything the disgruntled knight may consequently declare about chivalry being dead or dying.\nOn Dinner and Miracles\nPerhaps the most commonly known fact about your destination is that it is impermissible to begin dining until a miracle occurs. Many travellers decide, therefore, that the best way to obtain entrance into the Great Hall is to take on the responsibility of supplying the miracle themselves. The rest of the guests will certainly be glad to see you, especially those of the lower orders who are not even able to fill up on bread in the meantime.\nSee below, A Taxonomy of Miracles, to help determine which activities, apparitions, and appearances are designated Miracles and which are merely classed as Marvels, Events, Excitements, Interruptions, Troubles, Bothersomes, and Get That Imposter Out of Heres. If you do decide to get into the Great Hall this way, you don\u2019t want to waste your time concocting something that will fall into one of these unfortunate categories.\nOn Love Triangles, Parallelograms & Other Geometric Shapes\nShould you find yourself caught up in the heady politics of the Arthur and Lancelot situation, we can only suggest that you do your best not to get involved. We realise that sometimes this will not be possible. Therefore, a primer: the system of meritocracy (which names Lancelot the best) and the fact of divine right (which names Arthur the best) are in conflict over who is therefore truly, really, actually the best, and this, as you can imagine, casts great precarity over the respect, seating plans, and lovelife that are consequently due to these gentlemen. Don\u2019t be fooled by the apparent democracy of a circular dining surface. It\u2019s war out there. A good rule of thumb is to do whatever Sir Galahad does, but if he is out questing and\/or otherwise unavailable, Guinevere is your best guess. But try to keep your head down. It\u2019s really best not to rock the Round Table on this particular issue. It\u2019ll sort itself out. You\u2019ve only just arrived.\nShould you find Guinevere herself is asking your advice in this regard, it doesn\u2019t really matter what you say. You are already in trouble.\nOn the Episodic Nature of the Great Poem Cycles & How to Navigate It\nThis structural conceit is why it is difficult for us to inform you of the exact order in which you might encounter various landmarks, crossroads, allies, enemies, obstacles, and personal crises (both existential and food-based) as you go. No two journeys to Camelot are the same. However, you will find that wherever you go first will provide vital information and\/or items to help you succeed against whatever obstacles you face at your next destination, and so on. The problem is knowing which objects to keep and which to leave behind. A further complication: sometimes leaving an object behind is the very thing you need to do to make the best use of it. Overall it is best to take the episodic nature of your excursion in your stride, as it were. The mindset will suit you well at court in any case.\nYou may even find that once you reach your destination your adventures, if we might use so grand a term, have only just begun.\nOn Major-to-Minor Character Dissonance & How to Avoid It\nThe problem crucially is one of authorship. Depending variously upon historical agenda, political agenda, religious agenda, patriotic agenda, gender agenda, or confirmation bias; depending variously upon how one feels about the verse\/prose binary (if, indeed, one accepts such a binary at all); depending variously upon what one deems necessary in terms of plot complications, rising action, Grail questing and its conflicts (both internal and external), familial strife and the intricate mechanics of blackmail and\/or betrayal within those dynamics, the status of a pair (or trio) of lovers (star-crossed, unrequited, or Other) \u2014 all these points of interest will affect the landscape in which you find yourself. The point we are making here is that you may meet a great and brave and mighty knight one moment, and, in the time it takes a lion to yawn, find yourself confronting the same person as a meek and mewling guttersnipe the next.\nFor example, you may find Sir Bandolever is spoken of once in passing as having been present at a jousting tournament or sitting at the war council, and then never mentioned again: not so much a cameo appearance as a suspected spelling mistake. Or they might be at the centre of everything. Do you see?\nOn the Heavy Burden of Protagonism\nIt falls to you, we\u2019re afraid.\nRose Biggin writes stories and plays.

And she didn\u2019t need to be liked if she didn\u2019t want to be liked. If people had a problem with her attitude, or with her face, or with her wide, white ghost-eye, she lived at the very tippy-top of the food chain. She could just hold them down, strip their flesh away, and eat their bones like long, white KitKat bars.\nAs long as nobody ever figured it out.\nBut it was lonely, never being liked. Spending all her time not being noticed. And the friends she did make never lasted long.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a growing girl,\u201d her mom always said, \u201cand growing up is a hungry business.\u201d\n* * *\nLinnet\u2019s first-grade teacher huddled in a whispering, hissing bundle with the other first-grade teachers on the opposite side of the playground. Blue and red lights flashed off the silver of the chain-link fence behind them from the parking lot. Red-haired Meghan Wells screamed as two tall men dressed in blue lifted her into the ambulance. The principal stood beside the ambulance, talking quickly into his cellphone.\nAll the other kids had climbed the rope swing, and the jungle gym, and all the way to the top of the slide so they could see everything as it happened. They whispered and hissed at each other too, like smaller, younger colonies of first-grade teachers.\nNot Linnet. Linnet was in a time-out.\n\u201cYou have blood on your chin,\u201d said a boy\u2019s voice.\nLinnet looked up and saw a scrawny kid with a black eye standing a few feet away. She didn\u2019t know his name. He must be new, she thought.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t let me go wash it off yet,\u201d she said. The adults were all too busy watching the tall men take Meghan Wells away to take her to the bathroom. Linnet could tell they were angry. Linnet could tell they were suspicious. That\u2019s why they made her sit by herself against the wall, away from all the other first-grade meat.\nLinnet didn\u2019t like meat, though.\n\u201cYou must have bitten her pretty hard,\u201d said the boy. He stood with his back straight and kept his hands jammed in the pockets of his corduroys. \u201cWhat, were you trying to eat her?\u201d He made it sound like a joke.\nIt wasn\u2019t a joke.\nLinnet let her bangs fall in front of her one weird, ugly eye and said the thing her mom had told her to say when she got into trouble like this: \u201cI was mad. Everybody does mean things when they get mad.\u201d\nThe sound of a siren rose up like a bird as the ambulance pulled away.\nThe boy sat down on the grass and took his hands out of his pockets. Black and red scabs stretched over his knuckles.\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d he mused. \u201cSometimes, I do really mean things when I get angry.\u201d\nLinnet stared at his hands.\n\u201cDo you get angry a lot?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cEver kill somebody?\u201d\nThe boy hesitated.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never killed a person,\u201d he said.\nLinnet stopped trying to hide her ugly eye. Hiding it was making her look guilty. She brushed her bangs behind her ear and wiped her nose on the back of her arm. Humans could be ugly too. It didn\u2019t mean anything that she was ugly.\n\u201cHave you ever killed somebody?\u201d the boy asked, and she knew it wasn\u2019t her eye or her bent nose or the blood on her mouth that gave her away. The boy had come here because he was looking for things like her.\nLinnet almost never got angry. She only got hungry.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she lied.\nThe boy was quiet for a long time, looking over her face. (Most people never looked at her face at all, if they could help it.) She could tell he didn\u2019t believe her. She was going to end up running and running and running forever. Running until he caught up with her and beat her brains in with his fists and sawed her head off with a knife so he could carry her head home. All stories ended that way.\nShe tucked her long legs into her chest and wrapped her long arms around her knees and tried to make herself look small. It probably just made her look like a crumpled spider.\n\u201cI\u2019m Brant,\u201d said the boy after a minute.\nHe put his hands back in his pockets.\n* * *\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Linnet\u2019s mother asked a week later after she saw Brant waving good-bye through the window of the school bus. Her ceremonial robe swished in the breeze of the door and the whole house smelled like incense again.\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said Linnet. She dropped her backpack on the floor with a thump. Why were math books so heavy?\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him before,\u201d said her mother. Around her mouth, skin peeled away in dry flakes and sores. Even as Linnet watched, her mother pulled her bottom lip into her mouth and chewed. Linnet didn\u2019t ask why her mother was nervous. Her mother was always nervous. But she only put the robe on when she knew something bad was going to happen. Something she couldn\u2019t control. A silver pentagram hung around her neck and a dead chicken, its neck snapped below the skull, dangled from her hand.\n\u201cHe\u2019s new. His name is Brant.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him,\u201d said her mother.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Linnet, kicking off her shoes. Her toenails were getting too long again, and they poked out of the front of her socks.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\nHer mother took a long breath in.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry,\u201d she said, \u201cyesterday\u2019s leftovers are in the downstairs freezer.\u201d They never argued for long. Nobody argued with Linnet for long. Her mother locked the front door and gathered up the bottom of her robe so she wouldn\u2019t trip on it. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the attic,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me.\u201d The back of the robe dragged across the ground as she walked down the hallway. It was the last thing to disappear up the stairs, silky and wet looking, like the final drops of a red-and-black river running uphill.\nLinnet rolled her eyes.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d she mumbled.\nThe bones were buried under some freezer-burned sherbet and a bag of chicken nuggets. Linnet dug them out and sat down on the basement floor next to the washing machine to eat.\nEven through three floors, she could hear her mother\u2019s chanting in the attic. She could smell the dead chicken\u2019s blood. She pinched her nose with one hand and ate the bones with the other.\n* * *\nThe homeless man gurgled, face down in the sodden gutter leaves, and when he died, his shadow died too. It twisted and shuddered on the asphalt, and then trickled like water to pool underneath the body and lie still. Blood splattered an abstract map across the ground.\nBrant stood with his hands in his pockets, looking down. Blue hammerhead sharks swam across his shirt. They were going to have to get out of there soon, before someone came along and found two ten year olds standing over a dead homeless man with blood all over their jeans. Linnet crouched in the gutter with the corpse, idly breaking its toes one at a time while she waited for Brant to decide it was time to scram.\nSnap, like a twig. Someone had tossed a pumpkin into the gutter. It was rotten and concave and looked like the dead man\u2019s face.\n\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have killed him,\u201d Brant mused after a minute. He pulled his hands out and picked at the white shard of tooth that was lodged in his fist.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Linnet. Snap, like a pencil. Brant always did this afterward. He thought that if he stood around and looked sad and talked about death and morality for a while, then he was being responsible. Linnet thought he was just pretending to be somebody he wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cHe was practically innocent.\u201d\nSnap, like a peapod. Hunger bubbled in her tummy. Linnet thought she saw the shadow twitch out of the corner of her good eye and turned to stare at it, but it didn\u2019t move again.\n\u201cHe was, whatever it\u2019s called\u2014guilty by standing too close or something,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe was a bystander,\u201d said Brant. His voice did something strange, sort of wobbled and broke, like a bubble popping. Maybe he really did feel guilty.\n\u201cYeah. Cuz he stood by while his shadow ate people. He had a man-eating shadow, and you killed him, and now he can\u2019t eat people anymore. Good job.\u201d\nSnap, gritty and crunchy and strong, she broke another bone.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Brant, and Linnet rolled her eyes. Brant had his hands in his pockets again so she grabbed him by the elbow.\nHer hand circled the circumference of his arm easily. He dug his heels into the ground but she dragged him across the lot anyway. She was tall and treelike, and he was small and weedy.\nThe back door to the motel lay at the bottom of the concrete steps like a welcome mat. The hinges dangled loosely from the doorframe. Linnet and Brant walked over the door and went inside.\nThey followed the ten-fingered scores in the pine-green carpet down the hallway to the staircase, and then up the stairs to the second floor, where the walls were a terrible yellow color. Brant tried to stop there again; Linnet nearly ripped his arm off lugging him forward. At the very end of the green and the yellow a door hung ajar. She pushed it open with her toe.\nOn the other side was the lush, wet scent of gore and the harsh stench of excrement. Unlike the back door and the staircase and the hallway, most of the room sat undisturbed. Except for the bed in the center of the room. A red-black lake pooled across the mattress where two skulls, hollowed out like gourds, knocked foreheads in the middle. The rest of the bones\u2014collars, scapula, ribs\u2014were dropped in a careless pile beside the nightstand. The covers had been peeled back like Saran wrap and stuck together with fluids at the foot of the bed.\nLinnet entered the room while Brant stayed in the doorway.\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d Linnet asked, looking down at the pile of bones. There are children starving in Nigeria, she thought in her mother\u2019s voice. Her stomach rumbled.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Brant. He tipped his head to look the skulls in the eye. \u201cMaybe a little,\u201d he admitted after another moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go home. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nLinnet waited until he rounded the corner before she put some of the smaller bones in the pouch of her sweatshirt for later. She was hungry too.\n* * *\nThe next day they talked about it for the first time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how your mother feeds you,\u201d Brant said, watching Linnet trying to choke down a cafeteria hot dog at lunch. (It could have been a gourmet hot dog and it still would have tasted like dog business to Linnet. But as long as she was at school, she had to pretend to be like everybody else.)\n\u201cThe same way all mothers do,\u201d Linnet snapped. She hated when Brant started asking questions. \u201cWith food.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but where does she get it?\u201d Brant asked. He started eating her fries. Linnet let him because she hated fries anyway. They tasted like warm, clumpy dirt.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a nurse,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe gets it from the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Brant. He stuffed another fistful of fries in his mouth. \u201cBy asking nicely?\u201d\n\u201cShe waits till the people are done with them, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d Linnet looked down at her fries and realized that Brant was already picking the last few up off the tray and stuffing them into his face.\nHe ate them so I wouldn\u2019t have to.\nThe fear trickled down her spine and out the bottoms of her feet.\n\u201cAwethumb,\u201d Brant said. Then he took the rest of the hot dog right out of her hand.\n* * *\nThe washing machine spun around and around like a red wheel or a world or a storm or something. Brant\u2019s clothes spun around and around too, a pair of blue jeans and a black T-shirt, sloshing their way through a second wash and still turning the soapsuds pink.\nBrant himself lay on his back, feet braced against the dryer, arms folded under his head, and talked about how his mom could be such a bitch sometimes, and how he wished she was a little more like Linnet\u2019s mom.\n\u201cYour mom gets you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Linnet. \u201cI\u2019m amazed she hasn\u2019t had the basement renovated into a dungeon yet.\u201d\nLinnet\u2019s black pumpkin pajama pants and her glow-in-the-dark skeleton shirt hung loose on Brant\u2019s wire frame. He\u2019d grown a little between being ten and being thirteen. Linnet had grown more. She would always be taller, but someday he would be stronger.\n\u201cShe lets me come over, even though she hates me,\u201d said Brant, ticking reasons off on his fingers. \u201cShe lets you eat human bones, hell, she facilitates your eating of human bones. She never makes you do the dishes. . . .\u201d\n\u201cNot a lot of dishes required in the preparation of raw tibias,\u201d said Linnet. \u201cYou only need a sink and a big knife, really.\u201d\n\u201cShe lets you stay out as late as you want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she going to say to me, \u2018Nighttime is when all the dangerous lunatics come out\u2019? Duh. That\u2019s why I\u2019m out there.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014never makes you do your homework. . . .\u201d\n\u201cCuz if she did, I\u2019d eat her,\u201d said Linnet flatly. Brant finally stopped talking. \u201cOr at least I think that\u2019s what she thinks,\u201d she added, smiling so Brant could see it was a joke.\nBrant stared. His brown eyes were counting the teeth in her smile.\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m kidding,\u201d she said, swallowing her grin.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t your mom missing, like, three fingers?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cTwo and a half. I bit them off when I was a baby and didn\u2019t know better. I told you I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never even seen a picture of your dad,\u201d said Brant.\n\u201cHe ran off with another woman who didn\u2019t have a monster baby.\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know that?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t eat my dad! Jesus.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not gonna eat your mom?\u201d Brant asked.\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cYou have no intentions or thoughts about eating your mom?\u201d Brant went on.\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\u201cNot even, like, a leg?\u201d A grin was starting to poke out the corners of Brant\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re messing with me! I\u2019ve been terrified you were gonna rip my throat out this whole time and you\u2019ve just been\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMaybe a foot? Lots of bones in the foot.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014being an asshole! If I was going to eat any mom it would be your mom,\u201d Linnet snapped.\nBrant\u2019s shit-eating grin tipped toward the floor.\n\u201cThat\u2019s less funny,\u201d he said.\nNo kidding. A lot of things weren\u2019t funny. Chewing right through the insides of her own cheeks every night for two years until her mother stopped smelling like a midnight snack wasn\u2019t funny. Brant\u2019s mother always smelled like rotten fruit and Linnet wouldn\u2019t eat her if she was the last person alive on Earth, but Brant didn\u2019t know that.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t start with her foot,\u201d said Linnet deliberately. \u201cI\u2019d start with her teeth. So she could get a nice, big taste of her own blood while I snacked and then maybe she\u2019d understand how gross and offensive I find it when she calls me a blood-sucker.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s never called you that to your face,\u201d Brant said. \u201cAnd she has no proof that you\u2019re anything at all. No one does but me. She can\u2019t do shit to you.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019d cut off her hand and stuff it in her mouth like an apple, and plug her nostrils with her thumbs so her only choice would be to eat it or suffocate.\u201d\nBrant\u2019s mouth twisted like a broken cable.\n\u201cOkay, shut up,\u201d he said. \u201cShut. The fuck. Up.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, if she didn\u2019t suffocate that means I\u2019d have to do it myself. Or else pry her shins out of her leg muscles while she was still ali\u2014\u201d\nBrant stood up and kicked her hard in the stomach. Linnet stopped talking. A little bit because of the pain but mostly because she suddenly couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how ugly Brant looked when he was pissed. How furious and ferocious and famished. Like being angry and being hungry were actually the same thing.\nBrant stomped up the basement stairs and slammed out the front door. His clothes still whirled around in the washer, turning the water red. It smelled like sour milk to Linnet.\nWe\u2019re the fucking same, she thought. And he knows it.\nBrant must have walked all the way home wearing Linnet\u2019s pajamas.\n* * *\nLinnet\u2019s jaw cracked when she finally closed her mouth. White, powdered enamel dusted her jeans and the surface of the sink. She rinsed most of it down the drain, wiped the rest up with a paper towel, and put the file back in the drawer. Her fingertips were embedded with the crisscross marks of the metal, from holding it so tight for so long. Her jaw ached, and her eyes felt sore from the bright, white light of the bathroom.\nBehind her reflection, Linnet saw her mother step into the doorway.\n\u201cFinished?\u201d she asked.\nLinnet snarled a grin into the mirror, checking her handiwork for herself as she did so.\nShe counted thirty-two wide, flat, human-looking teeth. They were very white at their tips, and maybe too smooth and even. But nobody had noticed so far, and the school pictures were always muted somehow, lacking color and definition. Like they just assumed that everybody had something to hide, and the school photographer had no interest in figuring it out.\nOne hundred and seventy-nine days out of the school year, Linnet didn\u2019t smile. When she spoke, she spoke with care. She ate with care. Yawned with extreme care. But on school picture day, smiles were mandatory. And so were human teeth.\nAlthough most people, Linnet had found, in order to avoid trouble and the inconvenience of confrontation, were satisfied with \u201cclose enough.\u201d\n\u201cFinished,\u201d she said in answer to her mother\u2019s question. The word bounced around the newly empty spaces in the cavern of her mouth. Her whole head felt hollowed out and rang like a bell.\n\u201cI spent most of yesterday grinding some bones down for you,\u201d said her mother. \u201cThere should be just enough to get you to next week.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nWith the best part of her teeth gone, it was going to be nothing but bone-meal milkshakes for the next six days. They tasted disgusting and the milk made her sick to her stomach, but it was better than a spear through the throat, or a knife in the gut. Or a short drop off the back of someone\u2019s porch, rope tied around her neck, her best friend\u2019s hand giving a firm shove between her shoulder blades.\nIt was a lot of work pretending to be an omnivore.\nLinnet dressed in bright colors the next day, even though they hurt her eyes. She wanted people to look at her and notice little things. How she chewed her fingernails nervously down to the quick (because her fingernails defied all mechanism of nail care, but her teeth were made for chewing bones). How her blind ghost-eye was always watering (and not roving by itself, looking through walls and between the ribs of her peers into their dark inner workings, the red and purple ticking clocks that made their bodies go.) She put bleach in her eye, to blind it for a while and make it still; the pain made it water.\nShe flashed small, shy smiles so everyone could see her flat, even teeth.\nShe made another little memory of herself that they would remember later, when someone taller than Brant, and bigger than Brant, and smarter than Brant rolled into town with ripped blue jeans and a well-kept pair of hunting knives and started asking questions about all the missing persons in town. No one would bother to mention the sad, lonely, ugly girl named Linnet.\nLinnet hated school picture day.\nBrant met her at her locker. They hadn\u2019t talked in days, but Linnet had the clothes he\u2019d left at her house folded up in a plastic bag in her backpack.\n\u201cSup?\u201d Brant said. Then he opened his mouth in a wide, creaking smile to reveal a set of rubber vampire teeth smeared with ketchup.\nLinnet laughed until she cried. Brant had to prop her up against the lockers so she wouldn\u2019t fall over.\n* * *\nBeing Brant\u2019s best friend meant that Linnet could spend some of her time pretending she was a hero too. It felt good, like stretching small, satin gloves over her long tree-bark fingers.\nBut it also itched like crazy, inside and out. A long and ruthless itch, like the chicken pox, yet subtle and invisible as spider\u2019s web. And it built up over time, to a humming, angry buzz that made her want to slip out of her own skin and go walking around in just her bones for a while.\nJust for a night.\nJust for an hour.\nLinnet never left by the basement, or a window, but by the back door in the middle of the night. She took the house keys with her and made no effort to hide the sound of the door swinging shut. As she crossed the yard she saw the lamp click on in her mother\u2019s bedroom. Then the hallway lights, filling three windows. The light at the bottom of the staircase. And finally, after a climbing pause, the flicker of candles in the attic.\nShe didn\u2019t wait around to hear the invocations begin. She was hungry. And the itch had trickled down to her hands and the tip of her tongue. Linnet started running toward the park.\nDandelion dust white in the moonlight. Cold grass and dew beneath her bare feet. Her knees and spine popping as she stretched, really stretched, and unfolded to her full height. Crunching sounds inside her head as she unhinged her jaw and popped it back into place again. Deep, silent drafts of midnight air. And with it, the taste of someone out past curfew.\nSomething (someone) young, with willow-branch bones. Fresh and new, without the taste of antiseptics and formaldehyde in their marrow.\nAt the far edge of the park Linnet spindled her way over the top of the chain-link fence and dropped down on the other side in front of an old oak tree. She ran her tongue along the razor points of her teeth and reached up, up, to the lowest branch, and with one arm pulled herself into the shadows and leaves.\nShe left her sneakers behind in the ferns. While she waited, she slipped out of her T-shirt and blue jeans and draped them over a branch. Her house keys jingled in the pocket of the jeans as she folded them. Then she settled in, shallow breaths and branch-like angles, to the pitch and dappled dark.\nElbows and knees crooked outward, Linnet let her human eye drift asleep, and her white ghost-eye wake up.\nIn the dark she saw all the dead things and all the dying things. She saw everything that wasn\u2019t just rocks and metal and dirt. She saw will-o\u2019-the-wisps and flickering little insect lives. She saw the creeping traces of cats and the chuckling shades of foxes. She saw a little red heart with a ghost tied to it, bobbing along after a shuffling skeleton like a moored balloon.\nOne little red heart making its way across the roots and newly mowed grass, a cigarette dangling from its mouth. Permanent ink stains blotted across its skin. A dingy backpack, splitting at the seams with clean shirts and socks and bagged up peanut butter sandwiches, was hoisted up on its back. One angry, lonely, sad little red heart against the world.\nIt took a running jump and scaled the chain-link fence to get out of the park and out of this town.\nLinnet swiveled, and with a sound like leaves rustling, swung gently to hang from the underside of the branch. Her long toes gripped the wood and her long fingers uncurled. She waited.\nThe little red heart was thumpy and nervous, the way all little hearts were in the dark. It landed on Linnet\u2019s side of the fence with a grunt and cussed. Then it paused for a moment and stood still, looking out into the uneven grass and the unmanicured trees. Only a few hundred yards lay between the fence and the road, but from this end of the trees it looked like miles. It looked like there was no road at all.\nLinnet often wondered why they always stopped and stood still. And if she crept away and stopped watching, would the little thumping hearts stop thumping quite so loud, and walk with more confidence?\nOld and new grass stains on its knees, the little red heart started walking. It passed underneath the branches of the oak tree, and stopped again when its toe knocked into one of Linnet\u2019s shoes. The ghost rattled around inside.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d muttered the little red heart.\nSlowly, like dew dripping from a leaf, Linnet stretched, reached down, and wrapped the long fingers of her left hand around little red heart\u2019s throat. The ghost panicked, whipped and whirled and tried to break away.\nRelax, Linnet thought lazily to the ghost, reaching down with her other hand, I\u2019m going to let you go.\nShe pushed one ragged claw up the little red heart\u2019s nose. Then she screwed it in and crooked the very tip, through the barrier of cartilage and into the brain, where the string was.\nTwist. Cut. The ghost, still panicking, raced away, and the heart slowed down. Thumped quieter. Stumbled. Stopped.\nLinnet climbed out of the tree and, one at a time, extracted the fresh, milky bones from the warm flesh. She ate them slowly, savoring the taste.\nAfter all the bones had been devoured, she wiped her mouth and sat back, opening her human eye to look at the carnage.\nI\u2019m supposed to feel bad about this kind of thing.\nShe buried the limp, empty human deep in the earth beneath the branches of the oak tree, so that no coyotes, or stray dogs, or heroes would sniff it out.\n* * *\nLinnet stayed home \u201csick\u201d for four days, until the smell of gore had faded. Her mother didn\u2019t ask any questions, and Brant didn\u2019t come to visit.\nHe somehow always knew when to stay away.\n* * *\nFreshman year, Linnet felt the edges beginning to fray.\nThe hospital bones sat like scorpion husks in her stomach and tasted worse every day. Her teeth grew longer and whiter and more difficult to hide. Even with wire cutters, she could barely make her claws resemble fingernails. It took four doses of nighttime cold medicine to make her sleep at night and eight cups of coffee to keep her awake during the day (just long enough to slog through school and lunch period and the interminable bus ride home, then collapse on the couch or her bed and fall at once asleep). Her grades suffered, not that she cared because colleges didn\u2019t offer grants for American Abominations. And the time she spent with her best friend. . . .\nEvery day, she expected him to call or knock on the door and say, \u201cIt\u2019s been cool. And you\u2019re totes my bestie. But I have to kill you now.\u201d\nBrant\u2019s shoulders had filled out. His hands were huge.\nInstead, Brant stayed up late with her every night. They talked on the phone for hours, or chatted on the computer. Sometimes he snuck out of his house and stayed over, tangled in a pile of extra blankets on Linnet\u2019s floor, snoring. All but busting out of those black pumpkin pajamas.\nHe tried to stay awake until she fell asleep. Sitting next to his backpack, where Linnet knew he had his knife stashed away. But he usually dozed off sometime around three and slept like a hole in the ground till morning.\n* * *\nAt night she began to dream of eating. The cold medicine made her drowsy, but the growling inside and the constant ache of her shrinking stomach kept the good sleep away. She woke up tangled in the blankets or amid the torn shreds of another pillow, feathers stuck between her teeth. Once she came to with her body halfway out the window and onto the roof.\nShe started hunting once a month. Twice a month. More than she had ever, ever dared to before. The town was running thin on motherless nobodies. Still the hunger lingered, every day and night, just as bad as the days and nights before.\nShe took more cold medicine. She drank her mother\u2019s wine. Brant brought her Valium he stole from his father\u2019s cabinet.\nShe dreamed about eating. Long and clean, brand-new bare skeletons, still vibrating with the heartbeats they were torn out from under. Whole, unblemished human frames with perfect heads, like dolls, on the top of their spines. The heads were still alive and clothed in skin and eyes and hair. They talked to her while she ate them.\nHer math teacher. Her bus driver. Characters from TV.\nBrant.\nIt was the screaming that woke her up. The screaming and the warm, wet feeling puddled beneath her.\nAt first she thought she\u2019d pissed the bed or knocked over the glass of water on her nightstand. But looking around in the dark, her ghost-eye coming into focus before her human eye, Linnet saw that the walls and the windows didn\u2019t belong to her room. The bed was too wide and long. The ghost thrashing around and yanking on its fragile chains looked familiar.\nShe held a shinbone in her hands, tasted jagged mouthfuls of it between her teeth. The bone was slick and wet like the puddle.\nHer mother thrashed on the bed\u2014they were her mother\u2019s windows, her mother\u2019s walls, her mother\u2019s wracking ghost\u2014clawing at Linnet\u2019s arms and kicking at her chest with her remaining leg to get away. She held her Satanic cross in one hand and sobbed the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\nPanic split down the middle of Linnet. She tried to hand the bone back to her mother, apologizing, shouting over the shrieking, pushing around the flailing limbs.\n\u201cNo, Mom, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014I was asleep! I\u2019m sorry! Here! I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d\nHer mother didn\u2019t hear. She screamed and sobbed and prayed, switching back and forth between English and Latin, until Linnet could feel the first edges of another world\u2019s intervention on her skin. The first bitter taste of ash in her mouth. First scent of brimstone (or the bile on her mother\u2019s chest?) steaming into the room.\nShe left the bone on the bed and called 911 from the kitchen.\nThen she ran out the back door. She left the keys on the hook on the wall. Her shoes in her room beneath her bed. Her cell phone on her nightstand.\nShe just left.\nShe ran to the woods to hide.\n* * *\nThings unraveling like twine. Like entrails.\n* * *\nShe never expected help to come. Help was for victims. But she wasn\u2019t ready to leave yet either. So she slept in the woods and walked in the woods and ate a family of campers she came across.\nOn Saturday, four days after the accident, Brant started crashing around through the brambles, shouting at the top of his lungs. When she didn\u2019t answer he sang songs from The Sound of Music in a bad falsetto until finally she snapped and tracked him down to tell him to shut the fuck up already. She hated that movie.\nShe kept her hands close to the ground so she could spring when he drew his knife.\n\u201cIf you keep skipping school, someone is going to figure it out,\u201d said Brant. He wore his old khaki shorts. The ones with the lake-sized holes in the pockets. And Linnet knew he\u2019d worn them on purpose.\nHe\u2019d left his knife at home.\nLinnet walked backward and crouched low again in the briar patch. She plucked thorns from the branches and one by one pushed them into the wooden skin of the pad of her thumb. Then she pulled them all out again and inspected the seven bloodless holes. She didn\u2019t even feel the sting.\nOut of the periphery of her human eye she saw Brant put his hands in his pockets. The ends of his fingers poked out the bottoms.\nLinnet felt full. She felt calm. She felt like he was really stupid coming out here.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll know soon anyway,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded like a dying campfire.\n\u201cYour mom told the police you\u2019ve been staying with an aunt for the week. She said it was a monster that attacked her.\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d said Linnet.\n\u201cYeah, but she told them it was a different monster.\u201d\nLinnet paused. One of the thorns went too deep, and when she yanked it out, it turned out she had blood under there after all.\n\u201cSo what the hell have you been doing then?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cFinding another monster to kill,\u201d said Brant. \u201cSo that you could come home.\u201d\n* * *\nLife at home was walking on glass for a while. Linnet moved around the house whistling or stomping so that her mother could hear her coming. She stayed in her room while the physical therapists and the nurses shuffled in and out every other day of the week.\nHer mother only wore her little gold cross around her neck anymore. The downstairs freezer contained ice pops and frozen kielbasa sausages. The door to the attic stayed bolted. The incense and the books bound in black one by one found their way into the garbage. The space they left behind was filled with gardening magazines and a red leather Bible.\nLinnet tried to fast. She wondered, as the days went on, if it were possible to starve the deformity out. But when the dreams came back, and she was desperate, she paid a visit to the graveyard and ate bones that tasted like dust.\nSometimes, just to make her mother happy, Linnet sat down at the kitchen counter and ate hot dogs or macaroni and cheese. She would go out into the woods later to throw it all up so her mother wouldn\u2019t hear.\nBrant brought her bones sometimes. He only went hunting alone.\n* * *\nThings fitting back together. Like bones and sockets.\n* * *\nBrant, not the school nurse, called Linnet\u2019s mother that Wednesday in March. He stood in the doorway to the nurse\u2019s office, between Linnet and the entire rest of the school, while the nurse scattered nervous glances at them through the window from where she stood in the parking lot. Her arms were folded across her bosom. Red and blue lights flashed off the silver frames and tinted lenses of her glasses.\nThe principal stood next to her. And behind him, two paramedics jumped into the back of an ambulance and closed the doors behind them. The siren rose up like bird as the ambulance pulled away.\nIt wasn\u2019t the same as it had been in first grade. Police cruisers screamed in to fill the void left by the ambulance. The ache in Linnet\u2019s stomach grew arms and reached up into her chest, winding around her insides and squeezing them. Colonies of teachers gathered in the hallway. They stood outside the door, on the other side of Brant, and watched like waiting coyotes. Linnet saw the whites of their eyes through the gap between Brant\u2019s elbow and waist. They whispered and hissed at each other. Pens in their hands and chalk dust on their cuffs.\nLinnet rolled over to face the wall and closed her eyes. The stomachache moved up to her head, down to the roots of her teeth. The loudspeaker scratched on overhead and called all the students to the auditorium. Noise filed into the hallway.\nBrant closed the door.\nLinnet was too old for all of that now. Detentions weren\u2019t any good.\nThey left her alone in the nurse\u2019s office because they saw Brant standing at the door. And everybody knew about Brant. Brant had no reason to hide his eyes or file his teeth and he kept his hunting knife in his backpack.\n\u201cMaybe I should become a vegan,\u201d Linnet said to the wall. She said it like a joke.\nIt wasn\u2019t a joke.\nThe bruise on her face pounded with the sound of her own blood, and her own thumping little red heart. Every human wielded a little bit of a hero\u2019s strength when under the influence of terror. They kicked down doors and punched through windows. Linnet\u2019s leather-and-bark flesh squished like a rotten pear when she touched the bruise.\nBut it was the eyes, looking at her still through the solid door, that made her spine prickle. All those little red hearts, stormy with anger, and trapping her own (which was hungry and fearsome and terrible . . . and now, for the first time, terrified) into a corner.\n\u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d Brant asked.\n\u201cJust his finger,\u201d Linnet said. \u201cI bit it off because he was trying to dig my eye out. I swallowed it by accident.\u201d Not all a lie. Not an accident either though, just instinct. Fresh bone and cartilage between her teeth, and the sunlight on his skin (which she normally didn\u2019t have a taste for) made it sweet. Hunger followed Linnet around like a stray thread these days, unraveling her will and her self-control. Of course she ate the finger.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not so bad,\u201d murmured Brant after a pause. \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d\n\u201cHe hit me too. Before he tried to get my eye.\u201d Linnet said. Brant put his scraped knuckles and perpetually crooked fingers (broken too many times) into his pockets.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI kissed him,\u201d said Linnet. \u201cI thought he wanted me to kiss him.\u201d\nBrant pulled a stool across the room and sat down next to her. He smelled more human than usual. He smelled like another human. Like Melissa Sheridan from math class. Melissa Sheridan was cute. Her bones probably tasted like strawberries.\nLinnet rolled over to look up at her best friend, and closed her human eye\u2014watched his ghost waver like the reflection of moving smoke on water. His ghost watched her back.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to kiss you,\u201d said Brant softly.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Linnet.\n\u201cHe thinks you\u2019re ugly.\u201d Brant\u2019s ghost rumbled like a thunderstorm.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Linnet.\n\u201cHe hates you.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nBrant was quiet for a long moment. The ghost looked at the lump on Linnet\u2019s face and into her milky-white eye while its mouth moved and moved, opened and closed, shouting, screaming, tearing at her hands with insubstantial, desperate mist. Linnet opened her human eye. Brant sat still and silent. He looked worried.\n\u201cI could kiss you,\u201d he offered after a minute.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Linnet.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nA car door slammed outside. Linnet sat up and looked out the window. She saw her mother climbing out of the red Subaru. Her gray hair was swirled into an out-of-focus bun on her head, and her hands closed around the brim of her wide yellow hat. She was dressed for church. But her silk stockings had been cut and hemmed on one side to accommodate her wooden leg.\nLinnet\u2019s mother handed her hat to the nearest police officer and then opened the trunk and reached inside. She seemed calm and collected. One whole picture, instead of a ragged collection of jigsaw pieces. The police officer spoke to her urgently, gesturing with the wide yellow hat at the window. Linnet\u2019s mother shook her head and smiled. She pulled a rifle from the trunk.\n\u201cHoly shit, she\u2019s going to shoot me,\u201d said Linnet.\nThe officer backed up, hand on his hip. Linnet\u2019s mother smiled again, held the gun dangling from her fingertips like an umbrella.\nThen, swinging the gun back and forth, Linnet\u2019s mother clicked and thunked across the parking lot. The officer let her go.\n\u201cActually,\u201d said Brant, as Linnet\u2019s mother caught them looking out the window and smiled and waved, like she was coming to pick them up from the park or something, \u201cI think she\u2019s going to shoot me.\u201d\nLinnet turned to her best friend.\n\u201cWe should run,\u201d she said.\nThey ran.\n* * *\n\u201cDid your dad really run away with another woman?\u201d Brant asked as they sat together at the bus station. He folded his hands behind his head and looked up at the sky. Linnet looked up too. The stars winked brightly, like puncture wounds in the black satin fabric overhead. She\u2019d heard people say that all the stars were hidden in cities by brighter lights and tall buildings.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Linnet. She didn\u2019t mind losing the stars; she\u2019d never really appreciated beautiful things anyway.\nShe wove the bus ticket around her long fingers and ran the edge over her nails and wondered how Brant had come by the money to pay for it.\n\u201cHow old were you?\u201d Brant asked.\nLinnet shrugged.\n\u201cToo young to remember. Too small to have eaten him.\u201d She looked sideways at her best friend.\n\u201cWell, can you blame me for asking?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t your fault though,\u201d he said. His eyes still drifted over the sky.\n\u201cI\u2019ve killed other people, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nLinnet fell silent for a moment, not knowing what else to say. Her departure time crept a little closer. That quiet, heavy bulk of time, with tiny seconds padding silently through the empty spaces behind her. She couldn\u2019t see it but she knew it was there.\nShe was a monster. She knew when she was being hunted.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to know it was you,\u201d she said. \u201cThat let me get away, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. But what are they gonna do, jail me and find a new hero on Craigslist?\u201d\n\u201cGuess not.\u201d\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Brant continued after a minute, \u201cI\u2019m not letting the monster go. I\u2019m letting my friend go.\u201d He finally stopped staring at the sky. \u201cI\u2019ll get the monster later,\u201d he added.\n\u201cI could come back,\u201d said Linnet.\nA man in blue emerged from the building and walked across the parking lot to the bus. He climbed inside the open door and sat down, the lights behind the bus windows flickering on.\n\u201cCome back and I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d said Brant.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Linnet.\n* * *\nThings. Dark and simple. Things running like rivers into gutters. Things sliding like oil into storm drains. Things the way they always were.\nTwelve years went by before Linnet returned.\nThey\u2019d both grown. Brant was the enveloping, enormous dark clouds of a dangerous horizon. He was thunder shaking the ground and lightning setting fires. He was spectacular. He was a hurricane.\nLinnet was an ocean.\nShe sat down to think after he was dead (something she hadn\u2019t done for a very long time.) And after some long, difficult consideration, decided not to eat his bones.\nShe ate his heart. Even though she\u2019d never had a taste for hearts. And then she carried his body home and laid it peacefully across the top step of his mother\u2019s porch.\nPeri Fae Blomquist lives in Boston with her partner, her best friend, and a rotund feline named Peanut.

We passed in the kitchen, nodding, guessing from what others were eating which stage they were at in their day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Beginning, middle, end. We\u2019d been friends once. Then we were roommates. Then we were people who pooled the rent, and that was the most you could say of us. We didn\u2019t even meet to pool. We left our shares in an envelope on the counter, wrote what we\u2019d left on a yellow legal pad, and one of us counted the total and paid. Some of us worked night shifts. Some of us worked days. One of us, many suspected, did not work at all, and she was the one who brought in the creature.\nOn a yellow lined page stuck to the fridge, she\u2019d written an essay of explanation. But we saw the essay second. We saw the creature first.\n\u201cWhy is this here?\u201d said one of the people, who stood in the kitchen and pointed.\nI\u2019d just walked in on my way out the door. To grab some fruit leather and slip out the door.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s lost?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look lost.\u201d\nThe creature came over and butted my shins.\n\u201cIt likes you,\u201d said the person.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s hungry?\u201d\nI opened the cupboard, now stacked with tins\u2014tuna dinner, beef dinner, chicken and gravy dinner\u2014in addition to all that had been there before: flour and sugar in unopened bags, uncooked rice, pasta in boxes. I took out a tin of chicken and gravy.\n\u201cHow much do you feed them?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever they\u2019ll eat?\u201d\nThe person saw the note on the fridge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s signed Pamela.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one of us is Pamela?\u201d\n\u201cPamela\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nI opened the tin, a tab that you pull. Fft! An intake of air, like the tin had just risen from a long, salty dive. The satisfying cweeeeeaaak of the scored metal top. The creature butted my shins and purred.\n\u201cAw, so cute.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should we name it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does the note say?\u201d\n\u201cCrinoline.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cute name for a cat.\u201d\nThe person read the note aloud as I spooned out as much as I thought a thing ate. I looked at its sides and envisioned a stomach. How big was a stomach? In relation to this? Or maybe did house-creatures have more than one? Like a cow?\n\u201cIt\u2019s from a no-kill shelter,\u201d said the person. \u201cYou know what that means. Bottom of the barrel.\u201d\n\u201cHow do no-kills stay in business?\u201d\n\u201cPity.\u201d\nThe creature looked up with half-closed eyes and licked its furry chops.\nWe took turns petting it. I left for my day. That moment in the kitchen, the discovery of the creature, the feeding of the creature, the turns we took petting and holding the creature, was the most time I\u2019d spent with a person in the house for I don\u2019t know how long.\nThe next I saw of the creature, it was pooled on a person\u2019s lap. This was in the living room, where no one ever lived.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWatching TV.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe person stroked the creature. It purred.\n\u201cCan I join you?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cSo cute. Crinoline.\u201d\n\u201cI know. So cute.\u201d\nThe task of feeding went unassigned. It wasn\u2019t like housework, no need for a fridge chart. We pretended not to know when it was already done. We did it behind one another\u2019s backs. Soon we ran out of tins.\n\u201cCrinoline belongs to the house,\u201d said a person. \u201cWe should all contribute to kitty litter and food.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s ten bucks,\u201d said another person.\n\u201cHere\u2019s ten bucks,\u201d I said. \u201cGet chicken and gravy. It\u2019s Crinoline\u2019s favorite.\u201d\nI opened a cupboard for fruit leather. The cupboards were bare.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my fruit leather?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my pasta?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my rice?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my flour and sugar?\u201d\nWe all turned to Crinoline, who burped.\nWe bought more flour and rice and pasta. We bought tins and chow. We bought toy mice. We stood around the kitchen table, debating which flavor Crinoline preferred. I stuck to chicken and gravy. Others said tuna. One said beef. We put it to a test.\nSomeone said, \u201cWhile we\u2019re all standing around feeding the cat, maybe we should feed ourselves. I could make pasta.\u201d\nSo they did, and we all sat together and ate at the kitchen table, which I don\u2019t think we\u2019d done before.\n\u201cHas anyone seen Pamela?\u201d\n\u201cNot since Crinoline arrived.\u201d\nWe played with our creature, we cuddled our creature, we fed it as much as it wanted to eat. We watched whatever the TV was showing and passed our creature between us.\n\u201cWhat would we do without Crinoline?\u201d\n\u201cWe should thank Pamela. Has anyone seen her?\u201d\nThen the thefts began. I raised the matter in the kitchen.\n\u201cVisa called. Someone rang up a huge bill at the pet store. I mean huge.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\u201cAre you accusing one of us?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t me. And I\u2019d left my purse on the counter. So. . . .\u201d\nThen later it happened again, but this time to another person.\n\u201cSomeone made a gigantic donation to the no-kill shelter. I\u2019d left my wallet in the laundry room. So. . . .\u201d\nThen it happened again.\n\u201cSomeone bought a chicken farm and a gravy factory. I\u2019d left my banking page open on my laptop. So. . . .\u201d\nWe all turned to Crinoline, who winked.\n\u201cDid Crinoline just wink?\u201d\n\u201cA coincidence, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cFur in the eye.\u201d\n\u201cI think Crinoline winked.\u201d\nI checked my purse. There was fur on the inside. We waited nervously to find out what Crinoline would get into next.\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s been driving my car. There\u2019s fur on the seat.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s been texting from my phone. But only meows.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s been eating my houseplants.\u201d\nThe doorbell rang. It was a delivery from the plant store.\n\u201cOne thousand spider plants,\u201d said the man. \u201cSign here please.\u201d\nWe sat at the table that night as Crinoline chewed on a honeysuckle stuffy.\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2019d be angry, but Crinoline\u2019s so cute.\u201d\n\u201cI was angry, but who could stay angry at Crinoline?\u201d\n\u201cWhen cats are bored they act out. You can\u2019t blame the cat. Maybe we\u2019re just too boring?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\u201cPut on a play?\u201d\n\u201cWrite some songs?\u201d\n\u201cA laser show. With laser pointers. Crinoline would love that.\u201d\nSo we sewed ourselves mouse suits, we practiced meowing. We called the paper bag company, ordered their biggest. We rolled catnip joints, which we smoked, just to see. Someone went down to the docks and paid a fisherman in cash. That evening we stood in the shadows as he opened up his trunk. The body was wrapped in a tarp.\n\u201cFour hundred pounder,\u201d said the fisherman with a grin.\nWe carried the sturgeon into the house, dragged it to the living room, dropped it on a placemat of newspapers. We called in Crinoline and unwrapped the prize. Crinoline crouched, closed its eyes, and tucked in. We\u2019d moved the sofas to clear a wide performing space. We\u2019d arranged the spider plants in a lush backdrop. As Crinoline ate, tiny bite by tiny bite, we, the house, performed.\nCome dawn, the sturgeon was stripped to the cartilage, and the house was ready to drop from exhaustion. But we all felt jolly, and Crinoline purred, and that\u2019s when the doorbell rang.\nWe answered together, all pipe cleaner whiskers, all face paint and glitter, our tails of stuffed nylons a-wag in the air.\n\u201cPamela?\u201d\nDisheveled, confused, she stood holding Crinoline, who looked annoyed.\n\u201cCrinoline? But\u2014\u201d\nWe all turned to the creature in the living room, which assumed its true form.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d it cried. \u201cThe truth comes out! And I am a kitty impostor! Your housemate was held for all these days in a cage in the no-kill shelter. But my work here is done, my business provisioned, so she is now free. Good-bye!\u201d\nThe creature clicked its heels and left. We guided Pamela inside, the true cat in her arms. We gave them each a bowl of milk.\nThough we\u2019d been robbed, we didn\u2019t mind. The thefts had brought our home together. Though we\u2019d been tricked, we felt the wiser. We knew now the business of the no-kill shelter. And though our Crinoline ate the plants, and savaged the sofas, and pooped in the corners, we all felt somehow fuller and better. All thanks to the creature from the no-kill shelter. Now you know about the cats from the no-kill shelter.\nTrevor Shikaze\u2019s fiction has appeared in The Golden Key, Lackington\u2019s, Lakeside Circus, and elsewhere. He lives in Canada.

When the gladiators smile and have nice jewels in their teeth and long ropey dreadlocks and lift me up with just one arm, I never want those ones to die. I hope that they won\u2019t, and when Annaz isn\u2019t looking, I make sure the scoops of blood pepper I give them are heaped a tiny bit rounder.\nAnnaz is my boy cousin. I help him at my uncle\u2019s market stall and sleep at his house at night. He is thirteen and sometimes plays tricks. When the watchmen pass by he pretends to kick sticks or play with our shop dog, Urlo, but his face is very serious. Only the watchmen don\u2019t know that. They don\u2019t care much about a boy\u2019s face. My job when that happens is to drape an apron over the small sack of blood pepper under the table until the watchmen get far away.\nOur stall is so close to the arena that I get to meet nearly all the gladiators. Annaz told me that a lot of times in combat nobody gives up, so somebody has to die. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t be sad as many times as gladiators die. I would be sad all the time.\nThe day before he died, Typhon the champion came to our stall. He told me he was born in the shade of the arena. He bought powdered luck lilies and hare\u2019s claw. And a lot of blood pepper too. He said it was because he trusted my face and so would the watchmen, and also because Annaz\u2019s prices were fair.\nTyphon had a lot of scars on his arms and I could not tell which were from taking blood pepper and which were from being slashed in combat. He had a booming voice and a mushed nose, but his eyes were gigantic and his lashes almost as long as the dreadlocks on his head.\nBlood pepper is very precious and hard to make, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve only tried some twice. Annaz has tried it four times. Urlo kicked a whole sack over once and spilled it the very same day my uncle gave it to Annaz, and for that Annaz hit him with a stick.\nWhen I first had blood pepper, we had to poke my finger with a pin. It didn\u2019t hurt that much. Then Annaz put a dab of blood pepper into a dish and rolled my cut finger around in there. That was so some could get into my skin. I remember the dish looked scary from the tiny, rusty blood pepper dots floating in the drops of my blood. I didn\u2019t like that part.\nAfterward I was trying to feel what I felt.\nIt was a happy feeling, I think. Anyway it was not a bad feeling. I suppose it could make you strong. I didn\u2019t mind it because I felt like a gladiator.\nAnnaz and I work very late, because sometimes the gladiators want to buy blood pepper after a victory in the arena or even after they lose. We dry herbs and grind spices with Annaz\u2019s mother in the morning hours until the sun shines like a lemon. Sometimes Annaz\u2019s dad has a new sack of blood pepper for us too, which only Annaz gets to carry.\nThen we hoist our spices, powders, and pastes onto our shoulders using a padded rod and two baskets. I balance the light rod. When I\u2019m twelve, Annaz will let me carry a heavier one, but he says it still won\u2019t be as heavy as his unless I beat him in combat.\n***\nThe morning after Typhon died two watchmen came to my uncle\u2019s house. They talked to him outside the door while my baby sister, Tela, howled and howled in my arms. Then they left.\nThe rest of the day, Annaz was very quiet. We set up our stall in a thinking silence. Annaz was usually full of instructions about which wares to display at the front and which prices to adjust. It felt strange to lay the table out without his voice calling my jobs. I cradled the sack of blood pepper last, and set it down very softly at my feet behind our stall. Then I lay a swatch of burlap over it to protect it from flies, watchmen, and of course Urlo\u2019s sniffs.\nThe day crept slower than the sun, even though market-goers ringed our stall the whole time, giving me busy hands. I watched Urlo\u2019s ears flap away midges while I explained that ganzana root made into a paste with oil and rubbed on the jaw would stop a bad toothache. My voice sounded bored to me but the lady still bought two knuckles of ganzana.\nAll I wanted to do was go home and do chalk drawings of the baby. I wished I could find my friend Ishaq on the other side of the market and tell him about Typhon and his long lashes, which no one would ever see now. I thought that with one of Ishaq\u2019s baked chocolate conches today might have been better. I could have had small delicious bites of it between selling powders.\nEvery time I looked at Annaz he was still simmering. Being thirteen seemed a bad time. I did not want to become so serious as Annaz. He kept his hair so short and tidy now, and hated to get his ankles dusty playing with Urlo.\nAnnaz seemed pretty lucky to me. He had a dad and a mom and only one room in his house had a leaky roof. I only just got my sister, who my uncle brought home one night in a coddling blanket. He handed Tela to me with a bigger version of Annaz\u2019s serious face on. I didn\u2019t ask about my mother. I could barely remember her. She works near the harbor in a big massagehouse with her friends, which sounds like fun but is actually a bad thing to do. My uncle doesn\u2019t let me visit her.\nWhile I was thinking of how to cheer Annaz up, I noticed a stranger standing behind the belt of customers, trying to make me look at him. The market was still noisy and our stall had a big crowd. I told Annaz I needed to go for a pee and went to find out about the man.\n\u201cSmall one!\u201d the man called when I was within earshot. I was heading toward him anyway, but in a careful way. I pretended to be looking for someone in the crowd, thinking that that would be Annaz\u2019s way to do it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked in a slightly rude voice.\nThe man had no time for greetings either. \u201cI have coin for your rusted gold. Do you have any?\u201d\nWe usually sold blood pepper after nightfall, so I was puzzled to hear his request. Nobody said \u2018rusted gold\u2019 anymore either\u2014that was a name the old ones used before I was born or even before Annaz was born.\nI tried to make sense of the stranger without gawking at him in the busy market. He was not tall, but thick in the chest, and he left his legs bare beneath his summer sark. There were big bunches of muscles in his thighs and a ripple of scar the length of my whole arm twisting toward his knee.\nSince I started helping at the stall, I can spot a fighter even better than Ishaq, whose uncle is training to be a gladiator. The weird thing is that gladiators mostly sleep during the day because they wake up before sun-up to train and spend nighttime at the arena fighting or betting on others\u2019 fights.\n\u201cAre you a gladiator, mister?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I do not know you.\u201d\n\u201cI am Denniz.\u201d\nI suddenly knew who he was. \u201cThe challenger who killed Typhon?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I did.\u201d He showed his mean, wolfish teeth, but then smiled. \u201cAnd what about the rusted gold?\u201d\nDenniz did not look big or strong enough to show Typhon his death, but then I thought that must make him cleverer than Typhon. Typhon\u2019s eyes had been beautiful, but not clever.\n\u201cWait there.\u201d Annaz was surrounded by buyers when I ducked under our stall and opened the sack. Only Urlo noticed me.\nI brought Denniz a small scoop of blood pepper in a twist of waxed paper and he unwrapped it. He did not say anything, but his nostrils got big. It made his nose look like a mountain with two tunnels through it.\nHe gave me a bit less coin than the price of the powder. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, small one?\u201d\n\u201cMilli,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHave you ever seen gladiators fight, Milli?\u201d Denniz asked.\n\u201cNever. I am only seven.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d He twisted up the packet of blood pepper, thinking. \u201cWould you like to see a fight at the arena?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI can take you. All you have to do in return is ask your brother to speak to me about his rusted gold.\u201d\n\u201cMy cousin Annaz won\u2019t speak to anyone about that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if you ask nicely,\u201d Denniz said. I really wanted to see a real fight at the arena. And I could promise to ask, but that didn\u2019t mean Annaz would agree. Denniz saw my tiny nod and smiled again.\n\u201cCome to the rose garden across from the arena next fight day. I will wait there a while before they announce the animal fights.\u201d Denniz turned to go. \u201cAnd then we can watch the combat together!\u201d he shouted behind him.\nHe kept walking anyway until I lost him in the crowd.\n***\nThe day of the fight, it was hard getting away from our stall early. I spent all my spare time coming up with a good fib. Then I thought of the perfect one.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the cliffs with Ishaq and his sister to watch the fishing boats come in.\u201d It was something market kids liked to do. The lights were pretty to watch on the water and sometimes the fishermen left a half-bucket of slimy fish bait for us at the end of their haul, good for throwing at each other or taking home to flavor a stew.\nAnnaz didn\u2019t care, but he made me walk Urlo first so he would not poo around the wares, and Urlo was not quick making up his mind where he wanted to squat. By the end of it I really had to run.\nOn the way I wondered what it would be like. The arena is the loudest place in the world from all the shouts of the spectators. And I wanted to see the way the gladiators would jump and slash and drive in when they were winning. I even wanted to see the way the losers would crawl and fumble, then raise their arms above their heads. I was big enough now. I was not afraid.\nWhen the rose garden came into view I could barely breathe from speeding there. But I was happy I made it. I had my story safe in Annaz\u2019s ears, Urlo was tied up fast with his bone to lick, and I was about to watch a gladiator battle.\nRunning ahead of my legs, I spied Denniz waiting at the Fountain of Flowers in the center of the rose garden. A small champion, not a mighty giant like Typhon, but a champion no less.\n\u201cQuicker, fleet one,\u201d he called to me, already setting off. \u201cIt is almost time for the fights to begin.\u201d\nI followed him for a time, and when the crowds got thick near the arena gate, he waited for me, then took my hand. It wasn\u2019t at all like holding hands with Annaz, or even shaking hands with customers. Denniz\u2019s hands were hard as figurines whittled from wood. His palms felt like the loofah gourds we dry and sell for scrubbing clean a yellowed skin.\nThe gate was not far from us, but we were barely moving toward it in the crowd. The sun was half down and shouting was loud from inside the arena. I wanted to ask, \u201cIs that the animal clashes?\u201d even though I knew it was. Without words, I felt itchy next to Denniz. I got a bigger and bigger itch to say any silly little thing. Instead I stayed quiet and thought of the gladiator combat.\nNo gladiators had come to our stall for blood pepper that day, and I had been too busy to remember to ask Annaz about the fight. It was not a championship; I knew that because champions do not do combat in the arena two weeks in a row.\n\u201cWho\u2019s fighting tonight?\u201d I asked before I could stop my voice. At least it was an answer I cared about, not any silly words to scratch an itch.\nDenniz took a long time to look down his muscly arm to where I was. Both of us were taking baby-bird steps forward in the line. He drummed our two billets on his night tunic made of wool.\n\u201cWell. You will see, small one. One man, Kanos, is a fearsome hulk from Chioth Island. I do not know much about him, except one thing I have heard.\u201d Denniz leaned down. \u201cHe does not like to leave a doubt about his wins. Which means he does not leave much of his unlucky opponents behind.\n\u201cThe second is a training mate of Typhon, from the same stable. He is called Barburo. I think he will want to win this fight, to get his revenge.\u201d\n\u201cBut how will he get his revenge?\u201d I blurted. \u201cWasn\u2019t it you\u2014\u201d\nThe way Denniz nodded he could have been a market cat spying a fresh bowl of goat\u2019s cream.\n\u201cBarburo Bravemeat might want to cut me up in Typhon\u2019s name, but even if he gets past the Hulk of Chioth, he will get no further than Sanguine Denniz. The championship is mine and I am known to be selfish about my belongings, small Milli.\u201d\nWe found our seats. I think Denniz was selfish with words too, because he had nothing else to say until the jackals and hyenas and lionesses finished tearing meat out of each other and the announcer called for Kanos and Barburo. She rang a giant copper bell to summon them to come out through a mouth-shaped entrance, which was funny like they had been waiting inside the stomach of the arena. Then out walked Kanos, and Denniz had a lot to say. He nearly gave me a headache.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see your mettle now! Hide behind your knives and leathers, won\u2019t you!\u201d\nOur seats were in the common area. I thought champions could get better seats, but I guess I\u2019d never been inside the arena before, so I wasn\u2019t that sure. No one seemed to recognize Denniz either. I thought that was strange, until I thought of how far away the face of Kanos was under its armor. And Denniz had only fought in the arena once. Annaz said he was supposed to lose. But he won.\nWhen Barburo Bravemeat was announced, it made the crowd roar louder than three market streets right on top of each other. I leaned back into my seat until it made creaky noises and pushed my feet into the rail, then I covered up my ears. The arena was a giant ship and I was the steady figurehead in a wild rainy storm.\nDenniz did the opposite when the Hulk and Barburo started a funny dance with their swords held low. He leaned forward till I thought he might keel out of the ship, then he stood up clapping and shouted.\nI forced my eyes to open wide in case somebody made a killing blow. My head was imagining Denniz fighting the faraway man in the yellow plate skirt instead of Kanos. Barburo moved forward to swipe Kanos\u2019s knees with a sword. Kanos jumped over and my heart jumped even higher. Kanos moved forward and poked and poked with his bent blade. He poked in the direction of Barburo\u2019s chest, then belly, then head, missing, missing, missing\u2014\nThen Kanos\u2019s blade trailed away like a sad feather. I saw why. Barburo had stuck him. I closed my eyes. Then I saw a blade come out of Kanos\u2019s middle, and found out my eyes were not closed. The blade was shinier than my baby sister\u2019s warding gem, which is kept under her pillow. It was redder than really expensive blood pepper. When Barburo pulled it out blood gushed from Kanos\u2019s wound. The Hulk\u2019s fingers dropped the curved sword, then he went onto one knee. I covered my eyes with my hands to make sure they would stop seeing.\n\u201cBarburo stuck him!\u201d I screamed from the bow of my ship.\nThe storm of people shouting whooshed even louder. It was the angriest happy sound I had ever heard.\n***\nI did not expect Denniz to be in a happy mood after the gladiator battle since Barburo wanted to kill him next.\nI tried to be little and quiet as we were let out of the arena. Even though I wanted to hold Denniz\u2019s loofah hand so I would not be lost, I made myself brave. Milli Bravemeat, I said in my head, but that made me feel guilty, like I was killing Denniz by thinking it.\n\u201cSmall one,\u201d Denniz said as we approached the rose garden, remembering me.\nHe turned and plopped down to my height. Up close his forehead and cheekbones had hills and valleys, like someone had punched them a lot. His ears were funny too, all sticking out. He squinted at me strange.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Too much blood and death for a nest egg like you? Sure not!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about Kanos dying. I was thinking of Barburo. How you said he wants to kill you.\u201d\n\u201cAha!\u201d Denniz laughed. \u201cDo not be so concerned, small one. Typhon could not stop me and neither will his stablemate. Now listen, you\u2019ll remember to tell your cousin about your nice friend Denniz, who wants to talk to him about rusted gold? You\u2019ll remember?\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cAre you hungry? Come, let us find ourselves dinner before I deliver you home. We have had a lot of excitement tonight, and not much for our teeth to chew on.\u201d\nI was hungry, I needed to pee, and I was tired. I missed Annaz and baby Tela. But Denniz was right that I was hungry more than anything else.\n***\nWe went to a water-and-feed near the arena. For a change, I did not feel like saying much. When Denniz asked what I would have, I said, \u201cAnything.\u201d He bought porridge with currants and spices for me, and for himself, a plate of stew piled with lamb chunks and gravy on top. I looked around. Almost everyone in the booths or standing around tall round tables looked like gladiators or maybe people trying to be gladiators. Most of them had plates of lamb stew. The porridge was okay. I wished I had asked for stew too.\nThe door opened to let in another man and a bit of rain. My bowl was nearly empty, so now I felt tired most of all, and I still needed a toilet. It made me happy imagining telling Ishaq about my night next time I had enough coin for a chocolate conch. It felt weird that I could not tell Annaz.\nDenniz gave a chuckle and went up to the man in the doorway. \u201cAh, the winner!\u201d\nThe water-and-feed hushed up. I heard Barburo\u2019s name whispered, and Denniz\u2019s too. I felt most scared when Denniz put his hand out, and Barburo scowled. But then the bigger gladiator burped loudly and clapped it. Denniz invited him to our table.\n\u201cTonight, we are all champions. Sit down, sit down, let me start you off with a drink.\u201d\nBarburo squeezed into the booth on my side. He was huge and he smelled like some of the cooking spices we kept in boxes with the lids closed, if you sprinkled them on old sandals.\n\u201cThis is my small friend Milli,\u201d said Denniz.\n\u201cHello Miss Milli!\u201d Barburo said and cackled. He had a girly voice for a giant. It made me less scared of him, but it didn\u2019t make him smell any better. \u201cI\u2019ll have whatever she\u2019s drinking!\u201d he said, and cackled again. At least talking made him smell like drink instead of sandals.\nThe night went on and on. Every time I thought Denniz was finished telling a tale, or it looked like Barburo was too silly with the drinks Denniz kept buying him to even grunt a response, something sparked them up again. It was like they were snuffling gingerberry powder to keep them concentrating.\nFinally it was Denniz who said, \u201cMilli, time to take you back,\u201d and I tried not to look very relieved. He turned to Barburo. \u201cCome, old man. Shame if you were worn down to nubs when it comes time to face you in truth.\u201d\nEven though Denniz was smaller than Barburo, as small as I am next to Annaz, he managed to hoist Barburo up as the big giant\u2019s head lolled about. The smell came off him really strong and he muttered, \u201cYour father never teach you point a sword?\u201d and he began to snore with his eyes just slits.\n\u201cJump out, small one,\u201d said Denniz, and reached into his pocket for coin while he balanced Barburo slung over him. \u201cGo on give this to the kind sir there to settle our tab.\u201d\nThe square-circle-shaped coin was not one I had ever seen at the market. When I gave it to him, the white-haired troughman clucked and took out a heavy and dusty book to find what it was worth. It turned out it could pay for more than a porridge, a stew, and a gallon jug of anise wine, since I got back as many coins as I would make after half a day selling powders.\nDenniz was already outside with Barburo when I got done paying. I noticed there were hardly any gladiators left in the water-and-feed, and I wished I knew how late it was. My uncle usually let me come and go as I wanted, but I didn\u2019t think I had ever been out this late. The fishermen\u2019s boats would be floating in darkness, the slimy bait stews eaten up, the children all in their beds.\nThe door to the water-and-feed was heavy and a birdsong bell chirruped when I shoved it to get outside. \u201cDenniz!\u201d I whispered into the dark. \u201cDenniz!\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t see Denniz or Barburo anywhere. The brass money was warming up in my hand. I could have slept standing up, like a pony.\n\u201cDenniz!\u201d\nIt was not far to my house, but I had never walked the way alone in full dark. The moon wasn\u2019t even out in the sky. Denniz could only have left a few minutes before me, so I squinted into the dark all around for two big shapes. I even tried to sniff Barburo down, but it was no use.\nI found them when I went around the side of the water-and-feed. There was a wide path there, leading to the back of the building. Annaz once told me that\u2019s where a troughman and his family might keep a cottage to sleep in. Denniz and Barburo were propped on each other on the ground. Behind me, I heard the chirping bell as the last fighters left to find their stables.\nDenniz noticed me. He was not asleep from drink. \u201cSmall one. Wait there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. It was dark. All I could tell was that Barburo was snoring. \u201cI have your coin from the troughman.\u201d\nDenniz didn\u2019t respond straight away. He was fiddling with Barburo\u2019s arm\u2014I thought he was trying to find a way to lift him up again, so I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\n\u201cDenniz\u2014be careful, he\u2019s bleeding.\u201d My eyes were getting sharper in the dark, like a cat, and I saw thick trails of red going down the gigantic arm Denniz held, and dripping off the fingers.\n\u201cYes, he is, small one. Beautifully too. Do not wake him, now.\u201d\nI took a step back and unclutched the coins, all by accident. They hit the dirt with a sound like a small pillow being fluffed.\nMy eyes got better and better. I could see where Barburo\u2019s arm was spurting blood. It was not a big wound, more like a hole in a waterskin, inside his elbow. And I saw Denniz was balancing a bladder under the cut. He collected the dripping blood.\n\u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d I asked. A big ball grew in my throat, trying to force me to cry. I had not cried since I turned seven because I\u2019m too old now. My eyes did not feel sleepy anymore, but I was more tired than ever. I wanted to hug my baby sister tight and never go to a gladiator fight again.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know, small one? We are milking the ingredients for your rusted gold.\u201d\nHe hopped on bent knees to the other side of Barburo\u2019s body for a better reach.\n\u201cAnd not just any old ingredients, from the freshly dead or wounded or the smelly unfortunates in the belly of the arena over there, waiting to be thrown to the lions.\u201d He lifted Barburo\u2019s droopy bleeding arm, with its enormous muscles. \u201cPremium quality red, from the veins of a warrior!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cBlood pepper isn\u2019t really blood.\u201d\nDenniz looked at me funny. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t think so?\u201d He began to laugh. \u201cSmall one, small one. You do not know what game it is you play. If you do not believe me, ask your boy cousin. Or put a little of the stuff on your tongue and taste the steel tang of swords and men for yourself. Careful not to give a little girl a gladiator\u2019s might. Careful not to let the watchmen see you, eh.\u201d\nI ran out of words to say but Barburo seemed to never run out of blood. Denniz massaged his arm for what felt a long time, and each time more came out. I got so cold in the dark. The bag began to fill. I saw it get heavy, and it sloshed when Denniz moved it.\nTwice, Barburo made some babbling noises. His voice sounded soft and sweet, even when he was sleeping. One time, he began to take quick breaths like they were getting stuck in his neck.\n\u201cCome on, Denniz, I have to go home.\u201d Denniz was busy with his bag of blood. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re killing him.\u201d\n\u201cDenniz!\u201d I shouted when he would not stop.\n\u201cQuiet, Milli, shh. We are almost done, shh.\u201d He inspected Barburo\u2019s arm from every direction, as if there were more pockets of blood hiding on the back of it.\n\u201cHe will not die, but he will have a headache and a weakness like the worst night of drinking of his life followed by a romp with a questionable lady.\u201d\nDenniz stood up and looped a string around the mouth of his bag. \u201cHe will not die\u2014yet. Next week, I will make sure he does.\u201d\n\u201cOne last step,\u201d said Denniz. He bent to Barburo again with a handkerchief he soaked from a bottle. I thought the giant looked pale and weak already, but it was too dark to be sure. He was breathing funny, like he was having a terrible nightmare. Denniz wiped the arm down nice and perfect. The cut welled but Denniz wiped it again and again, then smeared something on it, and the bleeding stopped.\nBefore we left, Denniz scuffed his sandals in the dirt around Barburo, until there was no blood to be seen anywhere. He took my hand in one of his and carried the sloshing bag in the other. We set off in the direction of the rose garden.\n***\nThe day after the gladiator fight, I was not allowed to go to the market. I was in trouble with my uncle for coming back from the cliffs so late. He took my set of rolling hoops and my canary whistle. My baby sister seemed angry too. She cried all day, her tiny mouth wide.\nTwo days after the fight, I returned to the market with Annaz. It felt good to balance my baskets down the road. I did not tell Annaz my secret, and I did not ask him about blood pepper. I didn\u2019t speak to anybody about that, not even Ishaq. I needed to think about it inside my head. It made me feel heavy when I woke up and heavy when I went to sleep, like there were little pebbles all inside my body, especially in my chest.\nI asked Annaz about Barburo, but all he knew was that he was Typhon\u2019s stable brother and that he had a contest coming at the arena.\nLater, when Annaz went to pay the market commissioner and Urlo wandered away after another dog, I wet my finger and stole a swipe of blood pepper. I brought the tiny rusty fingerprint up to my nose until I could see every fleck in it. I sniffed. It had no smell, but I already knew the heaped sack did. It smelled like swords and forges and butchershops.\nThe day after that, Denniz came to speak to Annaz.\nI wished so hard we hadn\u2019t made a deal. I would have set Urlo on him to bite his arms and legs so he could bleed like Barburo did. But he walked right up to our table and I did what I promised.\n\u201cThis is my friend Denniz,\u201d I whispered on my toes, feeling like a liar. \u201cI promised he could speak to you for a few minutes about our blood pepper.\u201d\nMy cousin shrugged and gestured for Denniz to follow him. They went walking in between the hawkers and the baskets full of farm harvest.\nAnnaz returned alone and counted out a big sack of coin\u2014more than we had made that morning. I watched his every move but his eyes danced away from me. When he came back the second time, the sack of coin was gone, and he was carrying a bag I knew. He set it by his feet and it sagged all the way down. I wondered if it might leak. When Urlo poked around it to see what was inside, Annaz shouted him away.\nWhen there was a break in customers, Annaz said, \u201cThey say he\u2019s a false champion. Won with an illegal blow.\u201d\nI guessed that Annaz felt heavy inside too, and maybe his pebbles were even bigger than mine, because he did not smile that day, or the next, and it is hard to smile when you\u2019re feeling like that. I wished I could go back to a day when I had never felt that badness. I wished Annaz could go back there too.\n***\nThe night before Denniz fought Barburo, four gladiators came to our stall for blood pepper. I gave them all scoops of dark sumac, which looks about the same.

Your detailed analysis of the \u201cfaulty construction of the airlocks\u201d is excellent. I also like the way you emphasize the failure of the inspection process. Consider going into more detail about why the inspection process failed. Apathy? Ignorance? What changes in the process could have prevented the disaster?\n- Develop the effects of the disaster in more detail. What were the short-term effects? Were they predominantly economic, sociological, or psychological? What were the long-term consequences? Think deeply. Is the disaster the only reason we have not made another attempt to colonize a planet?\n- You\u2019re still making basic punctuation mistakes. Please note the following comma errors.\n- Error: \u201cThis resulted in a catastrophic explosion and many studies have considered this explosion to be unavoidable.\u201d Comma needed before \u201cand\u201d because it connects two independent clauses.\n- Error: \u201cThe evacuation order was given too late, this resulted in many unnecessary deaths.\u201d This is a comma splice. The simplest solution is to replace the comma with a semicolon.\n- Be more specific. Your reference to the Arsia Mons Colony Disaster as occurring \u201cabout twenty-five years ago\u201d is vague. We know the exact date: 4 April 2094. Use it. Your statement that \u201cmany people died\u201d is also nebulous. Three hundred seventy-one people died on Mars. Ninety-six died on the way home. Sixty-one made it back alive. Precision will make your essay more effective.\nFinally, the omission of any mention of Colonel Callahan is glaring\u2014a black hole in an otherwise very good essay.\n* * *\nStudent 17164\n- Good effort.\n- Your writing flows nicely. However, your essay is merely a restatement of the facts of the incident. Everyone is aware that \u201ca valve and its backup somehow failed.\u201d We are also aware of the resulting \u201ccatastrophic explosion.\u201d What we really want to know are your assessments of the disaster. Noting that the colony was \u201cestablished in 2081 and failed thirteen years later\u201d is not enough. Why did it fail? Think deeply. How did apathy on Earth contribute to the disaster? Could a \u201cfaster response from Earth\u201d really have saved lives, as you suggest?\n- Consider rewording the following awkward sentences:\n- Spreading quickly, chaos was observed by Colonel Callahan who also saw the only functioning shuttle and seized it.\n- After the shuttle had been launched by Colonel Callahan and started home, it was believed by many that they would never make it back to Earth.\n- Being that there was little chance to put food on the shuttle before it took off, enough food was not in supply for the long journey home.\n- Look a little more deeply into Colonel Callahan\u2019s motives. Why do you think he did what he did? Are actions such as his ever justifiable? How could Colonel Callahan have reacted differently in good conscience?\n* * *\nStudent 17074\n- I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve missed the point. The prompt was to \u201cwrite an argumentative essay about the Arsia Mons Colony Disaster.\u201d You have written a personal essay. Although interesting, this essay is not appropriate for this assignment.\n- Your uncle\u2019s role in the colony shouldn\u2019t be the primary emphasis of this essay. However, if you are going to make him the focus, you need to develop him in much more detail. Most references to your uncle are vague, oblique, and confusing. For example, when you mention that your uncle \u201cstruggled with Colonel Callahan,\u201d you need to elaborate. Was it a physical or verbal struggle? What was the outcome? Here are some other things to consider: How long did your uncle spend on the colony? Was he part of the initial settlement, or did he arrive on one of the later shuttles? What specifically was his role in the colony? What exactly happened to him? Think deeply. You mention that he ultimately boarded the shuttle but don\u2019t elaborate on his fate. Did he die on the way back? Was he one of the few who made it home to Earth alive? Finally, what was your uncle\u2019s name?\n- Many errors detract from this essay. Please note the CORRECT spelling of the following words: \u201cforlorn,\u201d \u201csuffocated,\u201d \u201cvaporized,\u201d and \u201ccannibalism.\u201d Bottom line: PROOFREAD!\n- Review sentence fragments. Fragments should be used judiciously and with purpose. Here are just a few I noted. For homework I want you to rewrite each of these fragments as a complete sentence.\n- A desolate blue pearl floating in space.\n- Alone, afraid, having no chance to escape.\n- Dumped in space, one by one, before the last few survivors could make it back to Earth alive.\n- Just as Colonel Callahan commanded.\n- Screams echoing throughout the ship.\n* * *\nStudent 17193\n- This is not an essay. This is a haiku.\n- Allow me to comment on what little you have provided. The title is effective: Colonel Callahan. Nice and simple. I assume the \u201cLarge ant on a leaf\u201d is a reference to the colonel. It is an effective beginning, and the animal imagery is appropriate for a haiku. The second line, \u201cfloating in space, looking back,\u201d should traditionally reference a season. But I must admit, referring to seasons in space is problematic. Your final line, \u201cat vanishing specks,\u201d could be stronger. You have squandered three of your five syllables on a single word. Haiku are too tightly constructed to waste syllables.\n- For homework I would like you to write a paragraph contrasting a haiku and an essay and explaining when each is appropriate. You might note in your paragraph that when your instructor says to write an essay, it is appropriate to write an essay.\n* * *\nStudent 17029\n- Nicely written.\n- I like this essay\u2019s sharp focus on Colonel Callahan. Consider providing a little more information about the disaster itself to help orient your reader.\n- The section about the voyage home is well developed. However, remember that there are widely varying accounts about what truly happened. For example, there are at least seven distinct versions of the mutiny on board the shuttle. Think deeply. Which version is true? Are any? You must be careful with sources when dealing with such a controversial topic. Primary sources about the Arsia Mons Colony Disaster are questionable. Secondary sources are almost useless.\n- I like your use of direct quotes from official transcripts when discussing Colonel Callahan\u2019s trial. However, you seem to focus a little too much on evidence against Colonel Callahan\u2014the gun, the knife, the dice, the testimony from his second-in-command. Remember, Colonel Callahan was never convicted of anything. Do you question the court-martial verdict, or do you ultimately agree with the findings? Be clear.\n- Finally, watch your commas. For example, you mangled your concluding sentence. It should be punctuated as follows:\n- When you look closely at Colonel Callahan, when you look deep into his soul, sometimes you see total darkness, sometimes you see blazing light, but you always see a broken valve and a man far from home trying to make it back alive.\n* * *\nStudent 17221\n- Unique perspective.\n- Your argument is interesting and provocative. Many have speculated about whatever happened to Colonel Callahan. This is the first time I have heard your assertion, but I suspect you are not the first to think it. However, I find your support somewhat lacking. Your argument rests heavily on similarities in appearance. Many people have \u201cdominant chins.\u201d Many people have \u201csad eyes.\u201d Time changes us all and can make it difficult to support assertions based on appearance.\n- Many of your other statements are intriguing. I like your observation that \u201cdecisions are easy to judge at a distance yet difficult to make in the moment.\u201d Few writers have taken the time to look at Colonel Callahan with the depth that you have. Few writers have taken the time to look at Colonel Callahan with the patience that you have. Few writers have tried to understand what it is like to make the kind of decisions Colonel Callahan was forced to make.\n- I like your use of dialogue, but the formatting is a little off. Remember, new speaker, new paragraph. It should look like this:\n- After his trial, Colonel Callahan dashed down the steps of the courthouse. A crowd of reporters followed him.\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d asked a reporter.\n\u201cSomewhere where no one will ask me questions?\u201d said Colonel Callahan.\n\u201cNow that you are free,\u201d asked another reporter, \u201cwhat do you look forward to most?\u201d\n\u201cThe day nobody recognizes me,\u201d said Colonel Callahan. \u201cThe day nobody knows who I am.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe day I no longer hear the screams.\u201d\nS.

Gochenour","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"The exact dimensions of Mezcla\u2019s intestines remained a mystery to the universe. Kirat had every intention of shedding light on the matter by disemboweling the book merchant when he next saw him. Apparently the arrival of the ghost had distracted him so much that he had not noticed that some of books in his order were ensorcelled\u2014namely the moldy series on estuary management, which overnight had extended tendrils of slime out of the coat closet where he had sequestered them, reaching over fifteen feet of marble tiling and into the card catalog. The sight of the gently pulsing mold, spread in snot-like globules over thirty square feet of floor, stunned him for a moment. The wriggle of an errant tendril awakened his rage. He snatched an oil lamp from a bracket on the wall and dashed it over the slime-slick, then spoke a word he had come upon in a very late night of reading years ago, in a book that had since transfigured itself into a clear vase of levitating bones. The oil burst into flames. The slime mold shrieked, shriveled, and after a moment ceased to move. Following the ashy trail to the coat closet, he found the books on estuary management had also shrunk to black hunks of plant matter, gently steaming and smelling even fouler than before. The card catalog, unfortunately, was still covered in gelatinous muck.\nHe bashed through the inner door and rattled open the fourteen locks of the outer doors. The square outside the library was empty. The scramble of early morning market traffic echoed from far away down the hill.\nKirat slammed the inner door shut behind him and stomped off on a long circuit around the library\u2019s outer wall. The enormous age of the library meant that were it not for some temples and satellite colleges of the University, it would be indisputably in the middle of a poor, cramped area. Narrow, tall, leaning houses of great age and poor plumbing rented by laborers occupied most of the neighboring streets. This also meant that at any hour of the day one could find a gaggle of financially minded children to run errands nearby.\nA likely group was playing a game with bits of chalk and wooden balls in the old square with the well. Children of various genders and sizes faced off against each other, batting the balls toward chalk-drawn patterns. This square was rarely used by adults, as the well water tasted metallic and the only points of access were narrow stepped alleyways.\nKirat made his breathing heavy and drew his claws along the stones of the library wall as he approached. As the sole nonhuman in the district he featured heavily in neighborhood mythology as a casual consumer of naughty and insouciant children, and he preferred to give those terrified by such stories a chance to flee. He sent messages by runner frequently enough that the older, more cynical children knew that though he was fearsome, he paid in gold.\nBy the time he reached the well itself, all the game players had fled but three. A tall, dark-haired boy, wearing a vest and pants with ragged hems, draped his arm over the well cover, a smirk on his thin face. Next to him a girl with curly hair barely contained in a kerchief crossed her arms over her chest and scowled.\n\u201cYou,\u201d Kirat said to the girl. \u201cTwo-eighths gold if you run to Illesy Hobner\u2019s shop and bring him back with all his supplies in an hour.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I tell him?\u201d\n\u201cTell him Kirat wants him. A spell exploded on the card catalog.\u201d\nShe nodded and went for the north alley at a run.\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said to the boy, \u201cgo down to the market and find Mezcla Jarvareth. His real name is Katan, if he denies the other. He should be in the Red Horn or the Dry Sawbill. Tell him Kirat wants him and if he doesn\u2019t want his skin strung up on a flagpole he\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bad part of town,\u201d the boy said pointedly.\n\u201cFour-eighths gold if you get him here by noon. Two if by sundown,\u201d Kirat said.\nThe boy shoved his hands in his pockets and sauntered toward the alley that left the square toward the west.\nKirat felt the fabric of his trousers being gently tugged, then his waistcoat. His hand snaked down and caught the tiny fist attempting to fish out the ring of keys from his pocket.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he said, incredulous. \u201cAre you trying to steal from me?\u201d\nHis disbelief increased when he hauled the culprit out in front of him. This child was too little and too shabby to guess at a gender; its face was all enormous dark eyes and locks of unkempt hair, its clothes mostly rags.\n\u201cHere, you, leave off that,\u201d he said severely. \u201cI haven\u2019t got anything in my pockets that would do you any good. Go home to your mother.\u201d\nThis occasioned a sneer of laughter from the boy he had sent after Mezcla, who had stopped in the alley entrance to watch. \u201cThat trash hasn\u2019t got any mother.\u201d\nKirat aimed his deathliest glare, and the boy fled.\nThe impulse that had led the tiny thing to attempt robbery was apparently spent; it stared, awe and terror written all over its angular little face.\nThe librarian sighed, and released its wrist; it shot after the boy.\nAt nine thirty, two ghosts materialized in the front room. In addition to the one in the wastepaper basket, another popped into being on a blade of the ceiling fan. This ghost did not act so distressed as the first; after a cursory inspection of the room, it zoomed through the pillared entryway to the stacks.\nThe other ghost, still smelling of exhaustion, didn\u2019t even move out of the basket, but instead sat there flickering weakly.\nMezcla did not appear that morning. Illesy Hobner, however, had come promptly before nine to clean the card catalog. Illesy had graduated from the University with high honors ten years before. Due to personal inclination and a seedy family history, he employed himself producing small, portable spells for cleaning, organizing, and preserving, rather than going into politics, as other magicians of his caliber were wont to do. He did very good business and occasionally took tea with Kirat. The ashy, sticky remains of the mold could not stand up to the army of spice-charms and silver instruments murmuring tinkling anthems of cleansing that Illesy unleashed against it. The aroma of nutmeg still lingered in the air.\nCarefully Kirat loaded the forty-three new books onto his cart, lifted the hinged portion of the circular desk, and pushed the cart out. On second thought, he went back to the desk and lifted out the wastepaper basket. The ghost still rested inside, shivering. Kirat set it on the top shelf of the cart and wheeled it into the stacks. Presumably the ghost had appeared for a reason, and why in a library if not for a book?\nThe task of distributing a cart of books throughout the enormous building usually took all day and often went late into the night. An hour into shelving the ghost poked its head over the edge of the basket and started watching him. Its faintly glowing form grew a little more substantial; Kirat could see something like a face peering at the books on the shelves. He moved the cart down another shelf, the wheels squeaking and clattering. The ghost climbed out of the wastepaper basket and floated a few feet behind him, looking up at a shelf, then stopping by a rickety ladder.\nHe might be able to figure out what language it was muttering, but it would take some research. Linguistic intuition was not his strong point.\nIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to try something rather more basic.\n(Hello!) he thought forcefully.\nThe ghost wheeled backward, spinning about before coming to rest on the floorboards as though it had been punched.\n(Pardon), he thought at a lower volume. (I\u2019m never sure how people who aren\u2019t . . . what I am . . . will respond to mind-to-mind contact. Do you need to find a book?)\nKirat wheeled the cart ahead to a hefty new ladder. Two volumes under his arm, he began to climb.\nThe ghost rose and approached. A garble of noises, images, and ideas floated up at Kirat.\n(Take a deep breath\u2014or, ah, the equivalent), Kirat thought. He wasn\u2019t sure if ghosts were capable of inhalation. (What I mean is, calm down. Keep only one thing in the front of your mind, and speak up.)\nIt was perhaps a bit too much to expect that the ghost would be able to project coherent sentences right away. When it attempted another contact, the thought he could pick out was more of a mood: one of tentative questioning, and an image of himself, looking rather large and quite alarming.\n(What? What are you trying to ask?)\nThe ghost pushed the image at him again, this time making his ears even larger and more pointed than they were, his nose wider and flatter, his fangs larger, and the thumbs on his feet more noticeable.\n(Oh\u2014I see. Different species. Dif-fer-ent species.) The attitude of questioning remained, so he showed it a picture of a tiger and a lion. On second thought, he replaced that with a house cat and a lion.\nThe ghost\u2019s thoughts now took on a tone of apologetic chagrin. Kirat waved those away impatiently with a rapid-fire succession of images\u2014a condensed history of horrified facial expressions from students, professors, and city officials.\n(Do. You. Need. Help. Finding. A. Book?) he repeated.\nThe ghost hovered uncertainly. The picture he received was of a man in a crisp, monotone uniform, followed by one of a door clicking closed in a white room.\n(Right. Well, that doesn\u2019t tell me anything. We\u2019ll try something more basic. Who are you? What do you want?)\nThat was the wrong question; a mass of ideas and half-formed images flurried out from the ghost like a blizzard, colored and distorted by varying degrees of panic, anger, and fear.\n(Excuse me!) Kirat finished shuffling books on the high shelf and clambered down from his perch. The ghost had expanded to what he guessed were close to its living dimensions: a half-head shorter than Kirat and about a quarter as wide. If it was human, he thought it was probably a short, stocky woman. He couldn\u2019t quite find its eyes, and it shrank back down when he tried, to a huddled mass that could pass for a large dictionary.\n(Can you tell me what language you are\u2014were\u2014accustomed to speaking? I can at least help you find a book, if not the book.)\nThe ghost unfolded a bit, to the approximate size of a human sitting on the floor, but he caught no words or pictures that it sent toward him. Shrugging, Kirat turned back to his cart and continued down the row.\nFor the rest of the morning he saw glimmers of the ghost out of the corners of his eyes. It wasn\u2019t following him, but it would wander away for ten or twenty minutes, then pop around the corner for a moment to look at him, as though assuring itself it wasn\u2019t lost. Then just as quickly it would slip away again. Once he pulled up sharply at the sound of a book tumbling down from a shelf. Kirat was high up in the north wing of the library in a balcony that had been converted to an extra floor, only accessible by a tricky door two stories down behind a potted plant and a bust of an irritated philosopher, so he doubted the book-dropping culprit was a student. The ghost did not show itself.\nSometime in the afternoon he remembered lunch and wended his way down to the front desk. The watch he kept in the card catalog read half past three; he did not see the ghost again that day.\nAs he had expected, the boy did not succeed in producing Mezcla until just before the last fingers of daylight were receding behind the temple in the square. Kirat looked over his reading glasses (an affectation, as his eyesight was excellent) at the disgruntled boy and the smirking merchant who followed him. Silently he dispensed two-eighths gold to the boy, who glared over his shoulder before strolling out.\nKirat regarded Mezcla\u2019s thin smile grimly. He represented everything about his own kind that had driven Kirat to take up solitary residence in the library\u2014arrogance, opportunism, odoriferousness. It annoyed him that Mezcla used a stupid made-up name instead of his proper, ordinary name, Katan; it infuriated him that Mezcla claimed a dragon in his ancestry to account for his orange-dun skin and large yellow eyes. But most of all, he loathed that Mezcla, for all his flippant attempts to cheat the library, was still the most reliable rare book merchant in the city.\n\u201cSo.\u201d\n\u201cSo.\u201d Mezcla made that ponderous syllable more ponderous yet by switching into the other language they shared, unspeakable and largely unintelligible to humans; it sounded like one was trying to roar, gargle, and cough all at once.\nThe ritual hubris had to be dispensed with first. They swore at each other for a while, insulting each other\u2019s spatial reasoning, dental alignment, visual acuity, number of hairs in each nostril, and so forth. Mezcla made round accusations that Kirat had never seen a mountain and had in fact been born at sea in a tub. Kirat responded that if Mezcla had ever been on a mountain it was only because he had been chased there by a flock of angry satyrs. Also, he ate his own shit.\nMezcla drew out a package of rolling papers and a pouch of unknown herbs and rolled himself a cigarette. He lit this and smirked behind it. Well, he said, Kirat drank his own piss, so what was the difference?\nKirat felt somewhat relaxed by this exchange of companionable loathing. The topic of the enchanted books on estuary management was nearly at hand, and he opened his mouth to compare the snot-slick he had found yesterday morning with Mezcla\u2019s brains and other bits of his anatomy, when the merchant looked over his shoulder and frowned.\nHad he closed up for the night? Mezcla wanted to know.\nYes, why, Kirat snapped.\nMezcla gestured over Kirat\u2019s shoulder with the cigarette.\nKirat reached over the desk and stuck his fingers through two of Mezcla\u2019s nose rings in case this was a trick, then turned and looked behind him. There was no one and nothing in the doorway of the library. He prepared to give the rings a mighty yank when a faint scrabble of hard feet on stone caught his ear. He bent (obliging Mezcla to bend too) and looked under the hinged portion of the desk. The scrubby child who had attempted to pick his pocket was crouched there, an expression of terrified determination on its small face. He let go of Mezcla\u2019s nose.\nThe merchant moved quickly, reaching under the desk to hook the child out and set it on the desktop.\n\u201cWhat were you doing under there?\u201d Kirat asked sternly.\nThe child only gaped.\n\u201cHere, now,\u201d Mezcla said, adopting an easy manner that had suckered a great number of collectors of ancient books into parting with their treasures for less-than-market prices, \u201cdid you want to have a look at the library? It\u2019s a fine place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe child suddenly decided that confession and absolution was the route to escape. \u201cBen said an eighth silver if I took a piece-a-paper from the little drawers and brought it to him,\u201d it gasped.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make deals with Ben again,\u201d Kirat said. \u201cIf you got a card out of that catalog without my knowing it you\u2019d deserve at least two gold.\u201d\nThe child did not seem to know whether this statement implied future violence or not, so it blinked and looked pitiful.\nMezcla stubbed out his cigarette on his forearm and put it in his pocket. Kirat should know how to deal with a kid, shouldn\u2019t he? Didn\u2019t he have practice in this sort of thing? he asked casually, again dropping into growls and gutturals.\nThat was too much, and Mezcla knew it the moment he said it.\nGet out, Kirat said. Get out (get out) get out (get out) GET OUT (GET OUT).\nWhen the reverberations up and down the columns and the shuddering that shook the card catalog ceased and Mezcla was only a shadow at the far end of the square, it occurred to Kirat that he ought to have used at least a bit of his fury to demand the rebuttals to Planeth be delivered posthaste.\nThe child had shrunk almost as small as the ghost, trying desperately to get its short legs down onto the floor without being noticed.\n\u201cYou. Did the boy this morning tell the truth, that you have no mother?\u201d Kirat demanded.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the child said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nIt gulped. \u201cI lives by the Temple of the River God and the Temple of the Trees. I don\u2019t know about a mama.\u201d\n\u201cYou live in a house?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I lives by Vergil the rag picker.\u201d\nKirat sighed and took off his glasses. \u201cWhere are you going to eat dinner tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t eats dinner at night. I go to the old bread shop in the morning and get bread there.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean you steal it?\u201d\nThe child folded its hands and studied them. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have money other than the eighth silver Ben was going to give you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nKirat indulged in a great storm of self-pity as he ordered his desk, got out his keys, and straightened his waistcoat. After further contemplation, he removed a book bag of heavy canvas, the bottom stiffened with wooden slats, from underneath the desk and laid it on the counter next to the child. \u201cStand in here.\u201d\nIt looked at him suspiciously. \u201cYou gonna eat me?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I wish to convey you to my intended destination while maintaining a modicum of certainty that you aren\u2019t going to run off.\u201d\nThe child looked at the door, looked at the bag, looked at him, and shrugged. It was really a very small child; the book bag, which Kirat carried over his arm, came up to its armpits when it was standing. He guessed it was about five, though malnourished enough to appear two years younger. He flinched at that thought.\nThe acolyte who opened the gate at the nearest temple, the one that backed on the library square, informed him tartly that children, particularly small, dirty ones, were not part of their holy dispensation. Kirat considered disemboweling the scrawny young man, but when the acolyte got a good look at his face following this pronouncement he slammed the gate.\nThe temple up the hill from that didn\u2019t look after children either. He changed tacks and tried a few temples farther down into the slums, but there he was informed that if he had wanted to get a bed for the night he should have been there in the early afternoon when they were assigned. In growing frustration he explained that the bed wasn\u2019t for him, it was for this minuscule human occupying the bag hanging from his elbow (and, to all appearances, enjoying the ride about in the brisk evening air), and couldn\u2019t they spare three square feet of mattress to accommodate it? This met with blank stares and more slammed gates. At the last temple, this one nearly down to the docks, he tried a different request: he didn\u2019t need a bed, but could they spare a piece of bread or cup of porridge for this (he gestured emphatically) small person? No, they had already served their evening meal and cleaned up.\nAt some point during this progression the child sat down inside the bag, curled up against the side, and went to sleep.\nKirat walked slowly back up the hill to the library. The bag drooped lower, the bottom nearly brushing the pavement. It wasn\u2019t fair to say he\u2019d had a premonition of what would happen this morning by the well; he hadn\u2019t let his mind even get so far as a premonition, because to even admit the possibility made his heart clench.\nHe had shut the inner doors for what he had hoped would be a brief errand; now he opened them and clicked shut the fourteen locks of the outer doors behind him.\nThe trudge across the library to his room felt especially long. The child woke up when he set it on the hinged bed to stare groggily around the room. Kirat surveyed his provisions. The baton of bread sitting on the shelf by the fire was stale. The salt pork seemed very hard when he compared it to the child\u2019s small teeth. He didn\u2019t have any potatoes or onions or milk or other human foods.\nThe librarian stood looking at the shelf that yesterday had been very satisfactory and thought about what was not on it.\n\u201cYou got honey in that jar?\u201d the child said, calculation in its large dark eyes.\n\u201cThis jar?\u201d\n\u201cYou eats honey, with those big tooths?\u201d\n\u201cEat, second-person singular, teeth, plural. I put it in my tea.\u201d\nThe child considered in awe the idea of such a large and gnarled creature drinking tea.\nThis gave him an idea; he broke off a piece of the rocklike bread and slathered it on all sides with the honey spoon. He offered the chunk, looking rather slimy and unappetizing, to the child on a chipped saucer. It was a poor excuse for a meal, but the child crunched into it, ripping off smaller pieces and inadvertently smearing honey all over its face.\nA bit of memory slipped around the barrier Kirat had planted in front of that corner of his mind. He filled a pot with water and a bit of mustard and set it on the coals to boil, then added some of the pork. A teacup served as a bowl for some of this unprepossessing stew, which the child drank too fast. Sputtering, it smacked its lips and gasped to cool its burned mouth.\nKirat, unsure of what else to do, sat down in his writing chair, pulled Upon Whether Oaks Trees Mourn Their Acorns toward him, and opened it.\nHe read a page in silence before the child\u2019s voice came again. \u201cWhat\u2019s that book you got there?\u201d\nKirat told it the title.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d Kirat said shortly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cA metaphor is a way of speaking so one thing stands for another thing. So, for instance, when the boy called you trash this morning, that is a metaphor. He was comparing you to something you are not.\u201d Kirat flipped a page.\nThe child was silent. Perhaps it was thinking about the possible uses of metaphor. When he looked up he saw that it had climbed down from the hinged bed and was rolling out his mats in an interested way.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Kirat said, annoyed. \u201cYou\u2019ll get them dirty.\u201d\n\u201cThese got pretty pictures on them,\u201d the child said. \u201cDid you buy them?\u201d\n\u201cThese have pretty pictures on them. No.\u201d\n\u201cDid you make them?\u201d The child held one up, faded red and shredding a little bit, with a bird made of flames climbing across the surface in applique. \u201cI likes this one.\u201d\nKirat drew the tip of a claw across a line of text to find where he had left off.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the medafoar of the tree?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe tree in your book. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a multifaceted figure,\u201d he said sourly.\nThe child tried to open one of the drawers in the map cabinet, found it locked, and tried another.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d\n\u201cMaps.\u201d\n\u201cMaps of what?\u201d\nSo the night continued, half line by half line, question by question, until the child fell asleep wrapped in the tattered phoenix mat, cheek pressed against the map cabinet.\nKirat read five more pages, resolutely ignoring the sound of tiny snores, until he could bear it no more and lifted the child onto the hinged bed and draped it with another mat.\n\u201cFive,\u201d Kirat hissed to himself. \u201cNow there are five of the things!\u201d\nNine thirty had come and gone with no ghosts. Maybe they had gotten lost in the stacks somewhere and were unable to find their way back. At a quarter till ten, he had started to hope they were gone for good. At seven past the hour his hopes were dashed, as five ghosts pinged into existence one by one, suspended in the air around the entryway. They murmured and sighed and fluttered into the stacks. His wastepaper basket remained empty.\nKirat dipped his head to look under the desk and found the exhausted ghost was sitting on his stack of book bags.\n(Good morning), he thought.\nThe ghost hesitated, then mimicked the greeting back at him.\n(Close enough.)\nThe librarian looked over the desk. The child had followed him to the front desk cheerfully enough that morning after a breakfast of more stale bread and honey. He had fished a broom and a dust rag out of the coat closet and given them to it with instructions to sweep and clean. These terms were apparently unfamiliar; it was dancing a sort of waltz with the broom, periodically flapping the dust rag in the air enthusiastically. Kirat shrugged and went back to compiling a list of books on the virtues of the Hammer-Leafed Rooster Bush.\nWhen the exhausted ghost eventually rose and wandered toward the shelves, he finished his list with a flourish, picked up a little notebook and a stub of a pencil, and followed it.\n\u201cWhere you going?\u201d the child asked, falling in behind him.\n\u201cDo you see that little bit of light up ahead?\u201d\nThe child narrowed its eyes, turning its head to one side and then the other. \u201cMaybe. I dunno. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a . . . ahem. I believe it is a ghost.\u201d\nThe child\u2019s eyes got big in its face, and it retreated a step. \u201cA ghost?\u201d It backed up a few more steps. \u201cIs it gonna eat me?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that is its intention,\u201d Kirat said dryly.\nThe child looked back over its shoulder toward the relative safety of the desk, then at him.\n\u201cIf it tries to eat you, I will set it on fire,\u201d he clarified.\nConcern did not entirely leave its small face, but it took up following him again.\nThe ghost fluttered a ways ahead, stopping in an alcove between a reading room and a small interior courtyard that lit the nearby shelves with a band of clerestories. Curiously enough, the ghost-light did not merge with the beam of sunlight it entered but rather became more sharply delineated as a person with round limbs and a sad face.\nKirat went down the next row of shelves. These were the new open sort he had constructed a few years ago. He looked across into the next row and saw the ghost running its fingers across the spines of the books in the alcove. He glanced at the sign at the top of the case; they were in the ethnology section, specifically folktales.\nThe ghost had some insubstantial mass on this plane. By strenuous pulling, then flying up to the top of the shelf and flinging itself down upon its target, it managed to dislodge a four-page pamphlet (concerning the probably apocryphal tale of the goat-headed fish-man caught in the waterwheel of Lauertas), which fluttered slowly to the floor. The ghost looked at the next book on the shelf, a hefty illustrated volume as big as two stacked loaves of bread, and slumped, resting its head on the stacks.\n\u201cChilding,\u201d Kirat said. The addressed was amusing itself by counting the books on the lowest shelf. Apparently it only knew the first sixteen numerals, because whenever it reached this number it started over again. It looked up. \u201cChilding, come here. Look there. Do you see the book on the second shelf there, the red one with roses on the spine?\u201d\nThe child scratched its chin. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d\n\u201cFlowers. Big flowers.\u201d\n\u201cI sees it.\u201d\n\u201cI see it. Go around this shelf, take that book off the shelf, and open it up on the floor.\u201d\nThe child trotted around the shelf and toward the ghost, which withdrew suspiciously. The beam of bright sunlight illuminated the dirt on the back of the child\u2019s neck and a few scurrying flecks behind its ears that were probably lice. Kirat sighed. He did not have hair himself, so he was not terribly concerned about catching them, but he supposed he ought to wash his mats.\nThe book was quite large, so it had to be eased it out bit by bit. After it passed its midpoint, it dropped heavily, and the child staggered under the sudden weight. It set the volume down and tipped it open.\n\u201cLook, I did\u2014cor, it\u2019s got pictures!\u201d Its attention was suddenly enraptured by the presence of a colored plate depicting a golden-scaled dragon writhing about a large rock.\n\u201cYes, it has pictures. Come away. I\u2019ll find you . . . a different book with pictures.\u201d\nAs he herded the child away, he glanced over his shoulder. The ghost had floated down to the book and was slowly turning over leaves, pausing for a long time on each illustration.\nThe search for an acceptable book with pictures was trickier than he had first thought. The child found botanical illustrations boring, and zoological ones only held its interest so long as something or someone was being eaten. Most of the books of tales he had collected were aimed at a somewhat older audience than his young shadow, and thus depicted decapitations, dismemberments, and other sundry distressing fates with glee and in detail.\nOut of sorts, he returned to the alcove. The ghost had managed to pull down two more pamphlets and was flicking through them; it had left the rose-spined book open to a leaf with a complicated engraving of a towering storm cloud. The child apparently couldn\u2019t see the ghost now that it had moved into a shadow, and excitedly slid around Kirat to sink into a crouch over the book. It fingered the curved black lines of the tempest on the page.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Kirat said sharply. \u201cJust one minute.\u201d He felt in his trouser pocket and thankfully found a handkerchief. \u201cYou\u2019ve got grubby hands. Wipe them off before you touch that book.\u201d\nThe child somewhat doubtfully complied. The librarian looked over its head at the ghost and saw that it was watching them.\n(Did you find what you needed?) he inquired.\nThe ghost wasn\u2019t sure.\n(Do you know\u2014do you have any idea of why you\u2019re here?)\nHe heard several thoughts turn over in flashes through its mind. Finally it showed him a picture of the white, plain room again. The view suddenly swung downward; he was seeing the room from the point of someone sitting in a chair. Spread across its lap was an enormous, open book, printed on unnaturally crisp white paper. Another moment of staring brought a bewildering fact to his attention. The pages were entirely filled with complicated patterns intertwined with the runes of his own language, runes that he did not think any human had ever studied.\n(Do you know what these are?) he asked, but the ghost thought it was a book of mandalas or meditation exercises.\nThe ghost\u2019s memory skewed out of focus; the brushstrokes of the runes twisted and changed. Kirat supposed that if you couldn\u2019t read them there was no reason to remember them correctly.\nReading; remembering. He blinked with sudden understanding. (So, you\u2019re not really a ghost? You\u2019re alive somewhere?)\nThe ghost supposed that it was. At least, it didn\u2019t think it was dead. It had gone to its appointment this morning, as instructed (here a picture of another person in a plain suit producing a piece of white paper from a square box and handing it over a desk), and if the last two days were anything to go by, in a while it would wake up in that chair in the plain white room, with the book almost falling off its lap and a crick in its neck. When it knocked on the door it would be opened by the same severely uniformed man who had closed it, and there would be early afternoon light slanting in the windows in the front lobby. It would walk home slowly and try to occupy its time until dinner, when its spouse would return from a job elsewhere and cook.\nKirat rocked back on his feet and absorbed this new information. A series of events began to coalesce in his mind.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the child demanded.\nHe rubbed his temple tiredly. \u201cWhat is what?\u201d\n\u201cThis picture here.\u201d\nThe book now lay open to a plate of the Tree of Life intertwined with various mythical creatures and plants. Its finger hovered over a leaf drawn with overlapping concentric circles.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an oak leaf.\u201d\n\u201cLike your medafoar book.\u201d\n\u201cYes, like my metaphor book.\u201d\nThe ghost had finished its pamphlet and was watching them again. It asked him, in the clearest thought it had formed yet, Whose child is that?\n(I don\u2019t know), Kirat said. (It showed up at the library yesterday and I haven\u2019t been able to get rid of it.)\nUnexpectedly he felt a terrible wave of judgment roll off the ghost\u2019s mind. The images that flickered toward him were sharply accusatory\u2014the child\u2019s bedraggled clothes, its bruised feet, its dirty hair, the dirt on the back of its neck, a scabbed-over wound on its left arm, the way it kept wiping the snot dripping from its nose, its lack of name, it it it it\u2014\n(I was being flippant), Kirat thought, at a volume high enough to drown out this slideshow of guilt. (I am a librarian not a priest not a parent and I do not take in small children and anyway this one arrived yesterday so how am I to fix everything in a night, pray tell me?)\nThe ghost rose from the floor uncertainly and floated in the middle of the aisle. The next thought was painfully comprehensible, though not aimed at Kirat.\n(I\u2019m sorry), he responded. The ghost turned away and disappeared around the end of the row.\nIt took about an hour to search each floor of the library and throw out the students who had already taken up residence.\n\u201cGet out. The library\u2019s closing early today,\u201d he said to some fellows in tattered robes taking notes from a codex.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only been open for three hours,\u201d one of them said angrily.\n\u201cThe library is closing early today,\u201d he repeated in a tone that made everyone at the table shove pens and copybooks into their satchels as quickly as possible.\nAt noon he herded the last student out and slammed the doors. The child had shadowed him as he strode furiously about the building, hiding behind a shelf rather than face any of the aristocratic students. Several times upon turning he caught it pulling terrible faces at the back of a student\u2019s head.\nNow it stood by the desk, looking at him. \u201cWe gonna look at books now?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kirat said, and felt the tremendous finality of the syllable sink into his shoulders. \u201cNow we are going to do something else.\u201d\nThere was another door out of the library. Whoever had constructed it on the far north wall of the building had hidden it well in a recess below a stair fronted by a bookcase. Kirat had occupied his position a full century before he found the thin set of hinges along the edge of that section of shelving.\nThe child eyed the swinging shelves with great interest. \u201cYou gonna put me in that bag again?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going very far.\u201d\nThe doorway opened in the crevasse between two old buildings that led out into a narrow street. Kirat closed and locked the little door behind him. The narrow street led down to another old square with chipped and cracked paving stones, a shallow fountain trickling water at its center. The laundry whose side wall bordered the library square opened out onto this plaza, a striped red awning over its entrance. Four women were gathered on one side of the fountain, scrubbing bits of cloth over washboards as they talked and laughed.\nKirat\u2019s gait slowed as he and the child approached. His gaze moved over each washerwoman\u2019s face in turn. He thought he recognized the one on the north edge of the fountain, a lean-faced woman with shining brown eyes set above high cheekbones.\nHesitantly he said, \u201cGood day. Ialla Emeld?\u201d\nThe lean-faced woman looked up from her washing to survey him curiously. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI believe you have assisted me before,\u201d he said stiffly.\nShe laughed. \u201cIalla is my name, but I don\u2019t know you.\u201d\nKirat opened his mouth and then closed it, completely at a loss.\nA voice, hoarse with age, came from underneath the awning. \u201cWho\u2019s there? Do you have a bag of laundry?\u201d\n\u201cThis fellow is asking for Ialla Emeld, Grandmother,\u201d said the woman at the fountain. \u201cHe says I\u2019ve helped him before, but I haven\u2019t ever seen him.\u201d\nThe dry old voice laughed. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s asking for the wrong Ialla.\u201d\nKirat turned to see a very aged woman, curled white hair pulled into a tight chignon at the base of her neck, drooping eyelids almost obscuring her lively brown eyes, rise from her chair and limp toward him. His eyes picked out the familiar cheekbones and sardonic smile, and his heart sank.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had been so long,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe never do,\u201d she said, planting her walking stick in front of her and folding her hands on top.\n\u201cI need help,\u201d he said. Once the words were out, he breathed a huge sigh. \u201cThis\u2014this child\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI imagine it will be easier this time around,\u201d old Ialla said. Her eyes were sharp but not unkind.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I remember how,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou will,\u201d she said. She nodded at the raggedy child, who had submerged both arms in the fountain and was swirling them under the soap suds. \u201cWhat\u2019s this one\u2019s name?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kirat said.\n\u201cRight,\u201d the old woman said, abruptly brusque. \u201cUcia!\u201d To his surprise, the scowling girl who had run his errand to Illesy Hobner the day before appeared from inside. \u201cCatch that little creature and give it a bath. Try to find out its name while you\u2019re at it.\u201d She gave Kirat a thin smile. \u201cYou might as well come in and have tea.\u201d\nThe librarian sipped tea numbly in a kitchen chair while splashing, angry shouts, and squalls from the indignant child echoed from the next room. He was too old to not be resigned to the grief of remembered loss, but it had broadsided him all the same.\nUcia, old Ialla\u2019s great-granddaughter, came back to report curtly after half an hour: the child\u2019s name was Sal, to all appearances it was female, she had washed it and dressed it in clean clothes, and if the librarian didn\u2019t take it away immediately she was probably going to kill it. Sal appeared behind her looking massively sullen in a too-big cotton smock. Its\u2014no, her\u2014washed hair had contracted into a tight mass of black curls.\nAt least, Kirat thought, setting down his tea cup, they don\u2019t look alike.\nAt ten o\u2019clock Sal, after attempting to re-cover her clothing in a layer of dirt garnered from dusty bookshelves, exhausted herself after running around the cloister trying to catch pigeons for an hour. Eyes barely open, she submitted to having her face wiped off with a cloth and being lifted up onto the hinged bed, where she promptly fell asleep on top of the phoenix mat, which Kirat had boiled for an hour before laying it outside to dry.\nFor Kirat\u2019s part, as he had slowly gone about buying loaves of bread, jars of milk, and baskets of fruit, walking through parts of the city he had not seen in\u2014if he let himself admit it\u2014over sixty years, his mind steadily let loose things he had hidden away. By the time Sal had collapsed into snores, exhaustion sat on every one of his limbs and an old ache had made itself known in his heart.\nThe noise that caught his attention at the threshold to the map room was so faint that it might not have been audible to his physical ears at all. When he opened the door and found the ghost standing there, he knew it had not been. Its form had grown more distinct yet; he could clearly see its ears under cropped straight hair, its nose, its mouth, the bags and tear stains under its eyes. He stood aside, and it walked past him, nearly corporeal. It paused by the fireplace; he gestured at it to sit in the writing chair while he pulled a mat over for himself.\nBoth were still in the tremendous silence for a minute. Sal snorted and rolled over.\nThe ghost looked at him. I might have to\u2014leave\u2014suddenly, it said.\nKirat nodded.\nThe ghost bowed its head. Sometimes it is so much to be alone, it whispered. Underneath this he saw the apartment where the ghost lived in its waking life as it had appeared earlier this evening, quiet and dark. Its spouse had worked late, and the ghost\u2019s breathing echoed in the emptiness. He saw, too, a neat line of little capsules ordered on the table, which had been given to the ghost to help it sleep and which it had been hoarding, one by one, in a corner at the back of a cabinet, in case the quiet and the dark became overwhelming.\n(So now), Kirat thought wryly, aware of the indelicacy of the question, (now you really are dead?)\nNot quite, the ghost said. An image of the spouse, of uniformed men, of being strapped to a stretcher and carried. Not yet. Maybe soon. But when I closed my eyes and expected to be alone, I was here instead.\n(Perhaps that is not so bad), he said, then tried again. (If you are waiting, maybe it is better to do it with someone else.)\nThe ghost said it had been waiting for a long time. The story it carried was so tightly compacted into every particle of its being that when it unfolded it came all in a violent rush. Kirat reminded himself that he was too old to not be resigned to grief and too old to be surprised at the terrible things humans did to each other, and did not flinch. The ghost had been something of a political dissident when it was young, in a country far away. When it could not be argued down, older and crueler methods were used to make it shut up. When it was so broken it was ready to die, the regime that had brutalized it had ironically found itself overrun by a new empire, a new army, a new set of ideas. The ghost was too small and too damaged to threaten this new government, so it and its spouse were sent to a doctor to be recovered to life and usefulness. It was given the book of runes as part of a daily study of tranquility; it found itself in the library. And now it was a shadow that spoke with the librarian by the quiet fire.\nKirat listened and did not know what to say. He did not know how to explain what keeps one going on after the world has ended again. How does one know the way ahead when one has traveled so far and so long that the path behind has been lost? Who does a traveler become when the home left behind has disappeared?\nHow did he not fear the future when the mountains where he was born had been forgotten, and the ships that he sailed over the sea had been sunk and rotted to nothing in harbors where sailors no longer docked? How could he find it in himself to start again with another child when the child before had grown and gone to someplace he didn\u2019t know, and probably died there too?\nThey sat and were silent together until pale light came through the clerestories and the ghost faded away.\nA week later Mezcla strolled up to the front desk, the morning sunlight through the open doors making him more orange than usual.\nKirat had taken old cards out of the catalog and written letters on them in red ink, and Sal was deeply involved in arranging them on the floor inside the desk in various pleasing patterns. In another day or two he planned to begin instruction in the dark art of spelling.\nWith Mezcla was another, shorter merchant of their species, his skin dark with age. He did not deal in books, but he stopped into the library every ten years or so to drink mildly poisonous alcohol and trade stories with Kirat.\nThe librarian was too distracted by the large sunburst of consonants that Sal had constructed to trade satisfactory insults. An amused look danced over the short merchant\u2019s face.\nI\u2019m not sure I can do this again, Kirat growled.\nIf you\u2019ll remember, the merchant said delicately, we offered to take the first child. And you refused.\nKirat scowled.\nThe merchant ran an appreciative hand over the inlay on the desk. This is new since the last time I was here, he said approvingly. You will remember a certain of our countrymen, and here he named a name that Kirat knew, of a sorcerer and a scholar older than either of them. He was chartered to undertake a certain work, by an emperor far away\u2014a casting spell.\nWhat business has he working for humans? Kirat snapped.\nPerhaps he wouldn\u2019t, if the work itself weren\u2019t worth doing, said the merchant. It is a casting spell written in runes to throw a broken spirit far from the body that holds it.\nKirat let his head drop into his hands. Your timing is abysmal, he said, and as if to emphasize his point twenty-four ghosts appeared like floating dandelion seeds around the desk, swooped around the front room, and flew toward the books. Why here? Why me?\nThey are looking for answers, the merchant said. And a library is as good a place to start as any.\nSal chose this moment to ask for more cards, preferably with man-eating beasts on them.\nThe merchants\u2019 laughter echoed up into the dome.\nSharon J.

Invaluable Katie: carrot haired, forever displeased, and wearing at all times the clamped, life-soured frown of an underfed governess. Of course the mayor knew all about the eye-rolling whispers that dogged Katie\u2019s every step, tart-tongued Katie who dressed down for even the most formal occasions. Still, the political cost had proven to be slight. Katie Glynn, special assistant to the mayor, was the sort of all-purpose bulldog that any successful politician would give their eyeteeth, or even their soul, to have in their bullpen.\nNot that the mayor considered herself to be by any stretch \u201csuccessful.\u201d Do what she would, her city refused to flourish. Yes, its citizens paid lip service to the bright, shiny concepts of urban renewal and civic engagement, but in private, they subscribed as one to the notion that the city\u2019s best days were far, far in the past. And what could possibly be done? The Ohio\u2019s river traffic had faded to a shadow of its former, nineteenth-century self. Interstates gave the entire region a wide berth. Young people, having tasted the world beyond during family vacations or college adventures, fled in droves toward brighter lights and bigger cities.\nHardly any of the city\u2019s inhabitants really blamed their stocky, fifty-something mayor, or at least not any more than they blamed the previous eight to ten administrations. Time marched on, and there was only so much that even the most determined local official could do.\nBut Janet Bentham, two years into her term, was tired of settling, and this showed in her frayed temper, her regular bouts with sleep apnea, and her return, after eleven years clean, to the guilty comfort of cigarettes.\nKatie Glynn, ever grim, always assessing, tracked the mayor\u2019s descent with a clinical eye but never intervened, never even volunteered an opinion. Duty and habit, habit and duty. Katie did what she was told, and did it well\u2014which explained why she did not hesitate when her steel-haired boss called out, \u201cKatie? I need you in the conference room.\u201d\nThe two women faced off across the silent, neutral gray of the room\u2019s twelve-foot laminate table. Outside, a pleasant spring rain knocked the blossoms from the crabapples and hinted, in the greening world beyond the city limits, of crops soon to be planted.\n\u201cKatie,\u201d said the mayor, \u201cI grew up here, I\u2019ve given my life to this town, but I\u2019m at the end of my rope. We\u2019ve tried everything, and so did every mayor before me, but we\u2019re just withering away like some . . . I don\u2019t know. A husk. There has to be a way to promote lasting civic pride, there just has to be.\u201d She picked momentarily at one cuticle, then forced her hands to settle. \u201cI am desperate and I am open to suggestions.\u201d\nKatie Glynn, infamous for cowing opponents with her unwavering gaze, looked away and out the window, toward the white and pink shower of petals gusting to the glinting, puddled sidewalk.\n\u201cKatie?\u201d\nWithout a word, Katie plucked up a legal pad and a pencil. In a neat, precise hand, she wrote a few words, then slid the pad across the table. On the paper, Katie had written Don\u2019s Salvage Yard \u2013 2201 Fraser.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d the mayor asked. \u201cAn address?\u201d\nKatie pushed herself to her feet. The mayor could not read her expression, but if she\u2019d been forced, she would have said that Katie seemed, inexplicably, to be battling an onslaught of tears.\nAfter a church benefit that dragged until well past eight, the mayor called Roy, partly just to hear his voice\u2014God, how she loved to hear it still\u2014and partly to let him know she had one more stop to make. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up,\u201d she said, knowing he would. Not an exciting man, her husband, but loyal and considerate; no matter what hour she came in, he\u2019d have a mug of warm milk waiting on her bed stand.\nShe typed the address to Don\u2019s Salvage Yard into her phone and got a map that placed 2201 Fraser someplace past where Fraser actually ended, at the levee walling off the bottomlands of Mouse Creek. With a frustrated grunt, she plopped the phone into the car\u2019s cup holder and set off, certain she would find only a dead end. Katie, bless her overworked heart, had remembered the address wrong.\nFraser Street, once she reached it, went on its potholed way between fences and warehouses, faceless and deserted. The occasional streetlights glowed bluish white, their splayed beams making the darkness beyond seem darker than ever. Once, in the distance, she spotted a forklift moving pallets; at an intersection, a garbage truck hefted a dumpster on stiff hydraulic arms. Her Subaru splashed through gravelly puddles and then, just when she felt sure she\u2019d reached the levee, the road swung to the right, evaded a guardrail, and led downhill through a shadowy warren of trees. Her headlights beamed through mist, the light diffracting, turning even the pavement to whitish haze.\nAhead, barely visible, she spotted a wall of chain-link fence shining like crystal in the rain. With surprised satisfaction, she noted a wide sign reading, DON\u2019S SALVAGE YARD. VERY PRIVATE. KEEP AWAY. HONK TWICE IF ENTERING.\nJanet Bentham took a moment to light a cigarette, then obligingly honked twice. Across a gravel lot, a single light clicked on in a low runt of a building; with no gutters, its roof shed the rain in a curtain of ever-shifting strands. Then an outside light stuttered to life, its electric buzz audible even inside the car. A single mercury floodlight, it revealed dents in the shack\u2019s siding and brought out hints of what lay beyond the parking area: great mounds of junk and scrap, heaps of rising shadow and pressing darkness.\nThe door to the little building opened invitingly, but also slowly, as if it were backing away.\nThe mayor piloted her car as close to the building as possible\u2014the rain was pelting now\u2014and parked. For reasons she could not fully explain, she debated leaving the engine running, but then told herself not to be a ninny\u2014this was her town, Goddamn it, the town where she was mayor\u2014and after stubbing out her smoke, she switched off the ignition, opened the door, and made a dash for the office.\nInside, it was all warping panels and faux wood. A curling calendar from 1969 advertising Falls City beer. A single floor lamp, its incandescent bulb conspiring with its dusty shade to turn the whole room dimly yellow. A file cabinet. A rumpled man lounging contentedly in a fat beige armchair rocker, his dark blue coveralls smeared with oil. On his head, a brown Pennzoil bill cap, pulled low to the bridge of his nose. His hands stretched across his stomach as if belting him in.\n\u201cBad night,\u201d said the man, his tone affable. \u201cBrave of you to come out.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said the mayor, brushing off water. She remained where she was, on the welcome mat. It hardly seemed worth going farther inside; the office was no more than twelve feet across.\n\u201cSo,\u201d the man went on, \u201chow\u2019d you get this address?\u201d He tilted his chin so that his eyes, friendly but feral, winked in the light.\n\u201cMy assistant. Katie Glynn.\u201d\n\u201cGlynn.\u201d The man nodded pensively and steepled his fingers. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve come to the right place. You head on through the door, there. You\u2019ll find what you need.\u201d\nThe mayor was only somewhat surprised to spot a door, closed. Had it been there when she\u2019d come in? Well, of course it had. Half-hidden behind the man\u2019s rocker, it was no wonder she\u2019d missed it. The habits of political life: you learned to take in the essentials, people first. Back doors were for burglars.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and started forward. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have an umbrella?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I do got a rule. Just one. You take home one thing and one thing only. Now some things come as a lot, obviously. A bag of marbles, a set of tires. But you\u2019re a smart lady, I can see that. So you know the deal.\u201d\nHis expression\u2014well, it was discomfiting, to say the least. Like being stared at by a highly intelligent rodent, sharp and intransigent. Uncompromising.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said the mayor. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nShe opened the door and stepped through.\nAll in an instant, the world was bright. She stood in the blinding, bleached sunshine of a parched, unlovely desert, and everywhere lay ramparts and battlements of junk. Wide aisles stretched away in all directions, veering toward unseen compass points that originated with the office shack behind her, the door to which was now firmly\u2014inexplicably\u2014shut.\nThe mayor blinked rapidly and raised a hand to shade her eyes. A moment ago, hadn\u2019t it been nighttime, raining?\nShe swung around, searching for some clue to tell her which way to go. When she returned her gaze to its original position, there was a man, seated at a cheap metal table, not ten feet away. Dressed in a plum-colored button-down, he was heavyset and Mexican. He was poring over the classifieds of a distressingly yellowed newspaper.\n\u201cHello?\u201d said the mayor.\nThe man looked up, grunted, and set down his newspaper. \u201cBuenos d\u00edas,\u201d he said, in a voice rich with clotted phlegm. \u201cYou know where you going?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cClaro.\u201d He paused and stared down the various avenues, squinting. \u201cOkay. I think, for you? That way.\u201d He pointed a beefy finger. \u201cLook around. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\nI\u2019ve gone down a rabbit hole, thought the mayor. I am in a new place, and I don\u2019t know the rules. Still, she could see no reason not to continue her lifelong reliance on manners.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and she walked off briskly, wishing she\u2019d brought her menthols, and worn different shoes.\nThe avenue, dust and dirt, was in no way paved. Defined solely by the heaps of junk and refuse to either side, some of it in low piles, some of it stacked to incredible heights, it continued on, level and wider than a two-car garage, for as far as the mayor could see. Sometimes the clutter hemmed the avenue, walling it in, but then it would open up into bays and coves, each weirdly specific: recliners here, buckets there. Over that direction, rigid blue insulation. Beyond? A landslide of comics, Casper the Friendly Ghost from top to bottom.\nHow, wondered the mayor, was she to find anything here? Was there, in all this infinite waste of cast-offs, anything that could possibly benefit her city?\nShe walked for half an hour and grew more demoralized with every step. She was all set to stop and retreat when she heard a sort of honking squawk: high pitched, each note separate, not unlike a rubber bicycle horn. It was coming from behind a heap of unruly printer cartridges. Curious, she crept around the blockade, and there, sitting on a grand old oaken desk (burned on one side by some long-ago fire), stood an enormous wire birdcage. Inside it fluttered two hefty birds, resplendent in bright white and iridescent black. Their crests gleamed scarlet in the sun.\nThe mayor was no bird-watcher, but she thought she knew a woodpecker when she saw one. The heavy, off-white bills were a dead giveaway. The birds did not, however, look like any woodpecker she could ever recall seeing. She stepped closer, fascinated despite herself, while the birds, unhappy with her presence, jumped from perch to perch, searching for room to fly. The larger of the two let out another series of honks, rhythmic and repeated. The smaller bird joined in, and the mayor, to her surprise, felt a smile warming her features.\nStraightening, she inspected the cage itself, over three feet high and painted pastel yellow. On its conical top, a paper tag had been affixed with white string. The mayor reached up and angled the tag so she could read it. It bore a single word: Bentham.\nNuts, thought the mayor, channeling her father\u2019s favorite response to anything not going his way. Double nuts.\nShe turned and strode to the wall of refuse beyond the birdcage, made mostly of exercise equipment. Each, she realized, came with a paper tag. She flipped up the nearest and read the name: Haller. The next said Youssef. Gomez, Schwartz, names and items, on and on and on.\nDouble nuts and blast it all to hell.\nTurning back, and without allowing herself the luxury of doubts or second thoughts\u2014indeed, she had none\u2014Janet Bentham hoisted the birdcage and set off back the way she\u2019d come, the woodpeckers hopping and honking as she went.\nThe avenue, however, did not look as she\u2019d remembered it. It curled slowly to the right, and the plain it crossed was full of dips and dells. The junk rose higher, the coves and pockets more frequent. Intersections cropped up, first at right angles, then at disconcerting diagonals, with each new path haring off to unknown distances. Down one, she saw forest; along another, what appeared to be the distant foot of a glacier. Overhead, the baking-stone sun shone too high in the sky to be any use in navigation, and at last the mayor, frustrated and thirsty, plunked down on a long-abandoned riding mower and admitted that she was irrevocably lost.\nDust and grit grimed her face and roughened her hair; had she brought lens cleaner for her glasses, she would have used it. Water was the first thing, that was certain. There\u2019d been some in a dish in the birdcage when she\u2019d started, but in all her walking, it had spilled, leaked away. As she tried to puzzle out a best course of action, she massaged her arms, the muscles complaining bitterly from hauling the cage.\nAcross the avenue lay a tumble-down heap of telephones, everything from Mickey Mouse, cracked, to sturdy hotel switchboards, their black spaghetti cords limp with the misery of abandonment. One phone stood apart, resting upright on a tidy wooden barstool. As the mayor\u2019s eyes settled on this, the telephone, a clunky fifties-era rotary, began to ring.\nBesides the still-nervous woodpeckers, the only significant sounds she\u2019d heard since entering this trash-defined wasteland had been the breeze riffling whatever items would shift under its touch: sheets of crinkling plastic, drifts of rustling newsprint. The phone\u2014strident, insistent, bracingly loud\u2014startled more with each fresh note. Nor did it stop. Ten rings, twelve. Fifteen.\n\u201cOh, fine.\u201d The mayor abruptly stood, smoothed out her jacket with her palms\u2014a habit, quite unbreakable\u2014and, leaving the birdcage, strode across the avenue toward the telephone. She seized the receiver and put it to her ear. \u201cHello?\u201d she said, her tone demanding, aggrieved. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cHello, dearie,\u201d came a cheerful, distant voice. Female, a clear soprano made throaty with age. \u201cI thought for a minute you weren\u2019t going to answer!\u201d\nJanet\u2019s eyes pinched themselves shut. \u201cGramma?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, dearie. Who did you expect?\u201d\nJanet hung up, fast and hard. The phone clattered on impact. She took two steps back, expecting at any moment to be\u2014what? Assaulted? Surely not, and in any event, nothing happened. The sun blazed, the wind preened her hair. The woodpeckers, satisfied with the sudden silence, gave up their frenetic hopping and rested, watching.\nThe telephone let out a single jangling ring that hit the mayor with ear-punching violence.\nThis time, she almost knocked the phone from the stool in her hurry to answer.\n\u201cGramma? Is that you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Why did you hang up?\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2014?\u201d She swung around, eyes to the sky. \u201cGramma, how can you ask that? You\u2019re dead!\u201d\n\u201cUm, yes, well. After a fashion, I suppose. But now, if you like, we can talk. Would you like that? You and I, Sugarlumps? Talking again?\u201d\nMemories darted in. The house on Second Street, the hulking yellow-sided Eastlake Victorian, the shingles on its steeply sloped roof layered in fish-scale waveforms. The massive catalpa out front, its stiff, papery pods littering the sidewalk. The swing hanging from the catalpa\u2019s lowest limb, the wide seat a single flat board, hung there long ago by Grampa not for children but for Gramma, for evenings of iced tea and Glenn Miller. Inside, the narrow, high-ceilinged hall leading down to the black-and-white tiles of the kitchen. Janet would run the hall\u2019s length, the tip of her index finger dusting the chair rail as she scampered closer to the waiting glass of lemonade, the fresh-baked oatmeal cookie. \u201cWelcome, dearie!\u201d Gramma would cry. \u201cMy little straight-haired wonder. And what adventures have we had today, eh? Tell me everything, everything you can.\u201d\nThe mayor swayed, tasted lemon on her tongue, scented oatmeal baking. The wind carried humming, Gramma\u2019s, the nonsense of Gilbert and Sullivan to speed the day\u2019s chores: laundry by hand, the floors scrubbed down with baking soda, the endless patching of Grampa\u2019s overalls with strips of blue bandana.\n\u201cJanet, honey? Are you there?\u201d\nShe managed a whisper. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good. You do sound very grown up. Do you have a beau? Wait\u2014oh, my. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re married.\u201d\nMarried? Of course she was married, twenty-six years come August, but Gramma had died a year before Roy had even come into the picture. A bad match, some had said. Roy was too old, a decade farther down the track, and too mild by half. But Janet had known from the start the match was perfect: neither she nor Roy wanted children, and better yet, Roy\u2019s every move and mumble brought Grampa to life. Gramma, sadly, was another matter. Search as she might, Janet had never been able to find a replacement, some younger Gramma mimic to tie, like a mnemonic string, to the finger of her life.\n\u201cGramma,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d\n\u201cAnywhere you like, Sugarlumps. We have plenty of time.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u201cHere, dear child. Right here.\u201d\nThe mayor\u2019s free hand fretted at the twist of cord, and she suddenly felt a loop of string. She glanced down and spotted another of the little paper tags. Helplessly curious, she plucked at it, raised it so she could see. In blue ink, it read Bentham.\nThe junk man\u2019s one rule roared in, drowning out Gramma. You take home one thing, and one thing only.\nStricken, Janet whirled to glare at the woodpeckers, so still and expectant, their white-ringed eyes peering, steady as snakes. In her hand, the receiver lowered as if of its own accord.\n\u201cJanet? Janet, honey, are you there?\u201d\nShe murmured, \u201cI\u2019m here, Gramma,\u201d but even as she said it, she\u2019d placed the receiver in its cradle, deliberately, firmly.\nSome things come as a set. The birds, then, paired in a cage. They were what she had come for; they were for her city, although what good they would do, she still could not imagine.\nJanet Bentham let out a strangled shriek of frustration. Straight-armed, she crushed her hands to fists. Then she stomped across the avenue, scooped up the birdcage, and set out for the missing exit.\nTwo weeks on, everything had changed. \u201cCity Besieged by Audubon Society,\u201d read the local headlines. \u201cIvory-Billed Bonanza,\u201d trumpeted the not-so-distant St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In New York, TV\u2019s late-night comics rode the region\u2019s sudden woodpecker craze to a ratings bonanza. David Letterman himself telephoned the mayor, begging her to appear on his show. She declined, laughingly, blushingly, citing the many pressing needs of her job. \u201cI\u2019m on the phone twenty-four seven,\u201d she confided in a giddy radio interview with Garrison Keillor. \u201cI have meetings every half hour for the rest of the year.\u201d\nBut the advent of the two ivory-bills did more than cause conniptions among the nation\u2019s ever-ready media and a handful of bird enthusiasts. Against all odds, and very much counter to the mayor\u2019s expectations, the birds stirred a latent civic pride. The city\u2019s populace, in discovering that they had the wider world\u2019s attention, became invigorated. As the news broke, not as a single wave hitting some isolated, undeserving beach but as a rising, beneficent flood, people smiled more, laughed more, made eye contact. More often than not, what would before have been only fleeting nods of \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d became, instead, launch pads for burgeoning conversation. People littered less, and weedy, unloved yards got spruced up, even without anyone from the mayor\u2019s office urging it to happen. And all because, as Katie put it, of two doomed birds.\nThey were doomed, of course. If these were indeed the only two remaining ivory-bills, they had no hope of repopulating. Even if they filled their nest each year for eternity, their chicks would be woefully, hopelessly inbred.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d said Katie, as she collated the latest economic reports, her thin fingers forcing each set of papers into neat, precise order. \u201cIt\u2019s also a very temporary miracle. A firework. Here today, gone tomorrow.\u201d\nOf course the mayor saw this, and understood why. So, too, did all but the most irresponsible of the reporters who\u2019d swarmed her city. Even the general population seemed to grasp that the woodpeckers could not, for good, reestablish themselves. What was incredible, startling, was that no one (except, perhaps, Katie) seemed to care. The ivory-bills were here now, and that was enough. Their eventual extinction neither registered nor signified.\nThe mayor could, perhaps, have predicted this based on her husband\u2019s reaction on the night that she\u2019d struggled home, birds in tow. She\u2019d banged into the front hall, lugging the birdcage in two hands, the ivory-bills squawking and fluttering. It was late, but of course Roy had waited up, and he shuffled in on slippered feet to meet her in the living room. He carried her glass of warm milk, but he nearly spilled it on seeing the ivory-bills.\n\u201cJan!\u201d he demanded, one finger jabbing toward the birdcage, his expression a freeze-frame of consternation. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get them?\u201d\nHis surprise caught her off guard. She\u2019d arrived home still stewing over her time at Don\u2019s Salvage; indeed, her drive home had been spent in berating herself, top to bottom. Why had she gone in the first place? And where had she gone? Better yet, why had Katie sent her?\nShe was seething by the time she reached home, but Roy\u2019s response short-circuited each and every recrimination. \u201cI need to take a picture,\u201d he said, stumbling over his slippers in his hurry to fetch the camera. \u201cHoly Toledo, no one\u2019s gonna believe this.\u201d\nHoly Toledo. Such a throwback, her Roy, with his neat silver goatee and his habit of blinking in spurts. He\u2019d been bald for so long, she had trouble recognizing him in older photos\u2014pictures of, say, their wedding. Who was that man she\u2019d married? He looked so appallingly young.\nRoy took ten shots of the ivory-bills, some with flash, some without, then perched on the armrest of the sofa, breathless. \u201cThey\u2019re extinct,\u201d he explained, \u201cor I thought they were. But one thing for sure. In the continental US, these are the rarest birds going. Bar none.\u201d\nThe mayor swallowed, feeling stupid, jilted. She\u2019d traded contact with Gramma for two useless birds.\nThen Roy insisted they open the living room\u2019s glass doors and let the birds go. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d she spluttered, balking. \u201cI just got them here!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re birds, wild birds. Not pets. They need to be out.\u201d\nIt struck her that he had not yet asked for any kind of explanation. Indeed, once past his initial shock, he seemed to have forgotten all about the why and how of the woodpeckers. They simply were.\n\u201cJan, honey. If these birds stick around\u2014and they might, the Mouse Creek floodplains are perfect for them\u2014my point is, if they stay, you will not believe the uproar.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, uproar?\u201d\n\u201cNobody\u2019s seen one of these for a century. Not reliably, anyway.\u201d He held up his camera. \u201cBut we have. I\u2019m telling you. This is news.\u201d\nSo they\u2019d let the birds go. They\u2019d watched their confused flapping as they hopped out of the cage, circled the yard, and, unaccustomed to flying at night, settled quickly in the canopy of the corner magnolia. But the next morning, even though Roy got up early to check, they were gone.\nThey didn\u2019t go far. Early morning golfers spotted them on the Engelman links, then commuters found them in Centennial Park, downtown. Later that day, they turned up at Howell Wetlands, where a squadron of delighted children got to see both birds drilling their bills into a long-dead willow. Their teacher, an amateur birder, had his pictures on the internet by four o\u2019clock, and between his images and Roy\u2019s, sent to three universities, it was only a hop, skip, and a jump to a city gone completely bird crazy.\nRestaurants served \u201cWoodpecker Specials,\u201d and the bars inaugurated a new mixed drink, the Ivory-Bill. Banners appeared on the overpasses, welcoming visitors to \u201cWoodpecker City.\u201d Local television (all four networks plus PBS) created animated woodpecker logos to introduce their programming. In the schools, science teachers amended their curricula to include, immediately, ornithology. They had questions to answer, after all. How, the kids wanted to know, could these birds keep banging their heads into solid wood without knocking their brains out?\nBy the end of the month, the city\u2019s moribund budget had done an abrupt about-face. \u201cOccupancy taxes,\u201d explained Katie. \u201cEvery motel for forty miles around is packed full, and based on reservations, they\u2019ll stay that way for a while. By the time the fiscal year ends, we\u2019ll have a significant surplus.\u201d\n\u201cHow significant?\u201d\nKatie shrugged her narrow shoulders as if such good news could not possibly matter. \u201cWe were running a deficit. Now? We\u2019ll be twenty percent ahead, maybe thirty.\u201d\nAnother aide informed the mayor that as of that morning, the city\u2019s major invitational soccer tournament had just renamed itself the Ivory-Billed Classic. \u201cLast year, they had six slots vacant. This year, they\u2019ve got a wait-list.\u201d\nSo far as the mayor could see, only two people seemed unaffected by the city\u2019s newly ecstatic tenor: Katie Glynn and herself. Katie, always dour, seemed to have sunk even further into her funk, as if she were readying for hibernation or preparing for self-burial. She still dispatched her duties with acceptable efficiency\u2014indeed, the truculent city council positively leaped to do her bidding\u2014but whatever limited joie de vivre she\u2019d displayed in the past now faded to a perfunctory nothingness, the relentless task-mastering of an automaton.\nAs for the mayor, she felt unreasonably trapped. She would normally have confided in Roy, most likely in bed, propped against the pillows and sipping warm milk, but about the woodpeckers\u2019 provenance, he still had no interest. If she even started in on the night she\u2019d brought them home, he simply rolled over and went to sleep.\nKatie, then, was the only person she could talk to, but Katie avoided the mayor\u2014avoided, especially, any situation where they might be alone, and able to talk in private.\nBy the second week of June, the mayor (now charging through two packs a day) could stand it no more. \u201cKatie,\u201d she said, accosting her by the copy machine, \u201cyou and I are going bird-watching. Just the two of us. This afternoon at four.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t, we\u2019ve got the Rotary Club at six, I\u2019m nowhere near prepared\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKatie. Four o\u2019clock. That\u2019s an order.\u201d\nBut four o\u2019clock came and went, and Katie Glynn was nowhere to be found.\nThe next day, the mayor tracked Katie through the Civic Center\u2019s various offices, and she pinned her at last in the cul-de-sac of the Department of Metropolitan Development, newly decked out in all sorts of woodpecker-themed decor.\n\u201cKatie,\u201d said the mayor. \u201cI am not pleased with you.\u201d\nKatie glared belligerently. \u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you get what you went looking for?\u201d\nThe mayor paused. \u201cKatie. You know more than you\u2019re telling, and I don\u2019t like secrets.\u201d\nThe office head, a portly man in a vast blue sweater, waddled around the corner, but on spotting the mayor and Katie, he retreated, mumbling apologies.\n\u201cNot here,\u201d said Katie.\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\nBut Katie brushed past her boss and strode away, past the receptionist and out. The mayor felt her eyes narrow and tried immediately to relax; having seen herself photographed in the newspapers with that exact expression, she knew all too well that \u201cnarrow-eyed\u201d was her most unflattering look.\n\u201cKatie Glynn,\u201d she muttered, \u201cyou are going to talk to me, and you are going to do it before you leave work tonight.\u201d\nAs the mayor expected, Katie absented herself from the office until five, and then, breezing in as if she owned the place, proceeded straight to her desk and gathered her things for a hurried exit. The mayor, watching through the glass of her private office, watched Katie pause, hesitate, then renew her search for the car keys she always stowed in her desk, top drawer left. When Katie had finally given up, the mayor stepped into view and held up the jangling keys.\n\u201cMy office, Ms. Glynn. Now.\u201d\nKatie\u2019s eyes shot rusty daggers, but she came, and the mayor shut her office door firmly behind her.\n\u201cSit,\u201d said the mayor, striding to her side of the oh-so-formal desk.\n\u201cGive me my keys.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re done.\u201d\nWith an exasperated groan, Katie flopped into a chair and leaned her head up against the floor-to-ceiling window that separated them from the office at large. Beyond, the bulk of the mayor\u2019s support staff had gathered as a group, chattering like teenagers as they made their way out for a round of Friday shots at Jazzman\u2019s. Once in a while, the mayor went with them\u2014but never Katie, the self-styled Cat Who Walked by Herself.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t,\u201d said Katie at last, her eyes on the ceiling, \u201cknow anything.\u201d\nThe mayor\u2019s eyes\u2014photographers be damned\u2014were slits. \u201cWhen you went, why did you go?\u201d\nKatie winced, stilled her escape-minded eyes, and said, in a newly deliberate voice, as if testifying in court, \u201cI was sixteen. I\u2019d just broken up with my first boyfriend, Curt. He was twenty, and he was the one who broke it off\u2014sort of. He just, you know, skipped town. I wasn\u2019t pregnant, it wasn\u2019t like that, but I missed him. In a very unhealthy, very teenage sort of way. I was literally telling myself, sometimes out loud, that if I couldn\u2019t have Curt, I didn\u2019t want to live.\n\u201cSo at the same time, I was into some other things that were, well, not very healthy. Drinking, sure. What kids call \u2018partying,\u2019 now. But other stuff, too. Wicca that wasn\u2019t Wicca. Spells I was pretty much just making up. Hopeful shit. And so there I was, two nights after Curt said \u2018See ya,\u2019 and I laid out some sort of summoning spell on my bedspread, all holly leaves and hazel twigs and this weird grinning terra cotta sun from my mom\u2019s garden, plus a whole deck of tarot cards. I had those taped to the ceiling in a pattern I thought was, I don\u2019t know, evocative, and I was doing this chant and I had all these candles going and next thing I knew, I\u2019d grabbed a pencil out of my school pack and I was writing an address on the wallpaper. I didn\u2019t mean to; I didn\u2019t even want to. It just came. 2201 Fraser. And as soon as I\u2019d written it, my hand felt like I\u2019d pinched a nerve, and I dropped the pencil\u2014I can still see it disappearing down the crack behind the bed\u2014and that was it. I had to go to that address. And the next night, I did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you bring back?\u201d\nKatie sat ever smaller in her chair, remembering. \u201cI went in thinking I\u2019d bring back Curt\u2014and he was there, sort of. His wallet was, anyway. All his ID. So I grabbed that. I figured that way, he\u2019d at least have to visit. But on the way out, I passed this little table, and on top of it was a key ring with three old brass skeleton keys. Each one had a red ribbon, and the first said \u2018Key to the City.\u2019 The second said \u2018Key to the Statehouse,\u2019 and the third said \u2018Key to the State\u2019\u2014and just like the wallet, the ring had a little white tag attached with my name on it, Glynn. So I picked them up, and\u2014God. Holding those keys made me feel hungry\u2014or not hungry, more like starved, but it was the kind of starving where it\u2019s okay, because you know there\u2019s a feast right around the corner. And I wanted that. Needed it. So I left Curt behind.\u201d\nThe mayor gave her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a confused look. \u201cSo the keys lied?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely those ribbons\u2014I mean, shouldn\u2019t I be working for you, not the other way around, if they were telling the truth? And shouldn\u2019t you be on track for the Senate?\u201d\nKatie drew her knees up to her chin, and her arms hugged her skinny, denim-clad legs. \u201cI changed my mind.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cAfter a couple of days, keys or no keys, I missed Curt. So I went back. And there was Curt\u2019s wallet, right where I\u2019d left it. I grabbed it and I walked out. Drove home. But the keys were gone\u2014I\u2019d left them in my underwear drawer. At the time, I didn\u2019t care. I knew that if nothing else, I\u2019d have Curt.\u201d\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d\nKatie nodded into her knees. \u201cHe called and said he\u2019d drive up for the wallet. The last thing he said before he hung up was \u2018Baby, you make me so hot.\u2019 But he never made it. Wreck on the interstate. The people in the other car, they were fine, but Curt, he wasn\u2019t wearing his seatbelt, so he got thrown, and the car landed on him, and . . . you get the picture.\u201d She hesitated, licked at her lips. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t much of a guy, and he sure as hell wasn\u2019t good for me. But he didn\u2019t deserve that. He didn\u2019t deserve what I did to him.\u201d\nThe mayor, to her own surprise, abruptly stood. \u201cOh, stop it. You had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I did! You\u2019ve been there!\u201d\n\u201cSo you avoiding me, this is about you worrying? You worrying that I\u2019ll change my mind, go back?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t find just birds. I know you didn\u2019t. And whatever that other thing is, you\u2019ll go back for it. And when you do\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKatie Glynn! If you were so certain I\u2019d screw this up, why did you send me?\u201d\nKatie\u2019s arms shot out and her feet dropped to the floor in a gesture of surrender, hopeless and lost. \u201cI told you, I made a mistake! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Her face flushed maple-red; tears welled. \u201cThis was supposed to be my city, remember? And I hated watching it die.\u201d\nThe mayor marched around the table, leaned down, and planted a firm, motherly kiss on Katie\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, Katie. And I forgive you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNow. Woodpeckers or no, I need you at your best in order to run this town. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure I need you more than ever, because maybe these birds are a flash in the pan. If so, all the more reason to strike while the iron is hot. So enough wallowing. Go home, stop worrying, and next week, bring your A-game. The one you used to bring every day. Clear?\u201d\nSniffing, wiping stubborn tears, Katie gave a tiny nod and let out a gasping whisper that the mayor took to be a yes.\n\u201cGood. See you Monday.\u201d\nAll through the summer and on into fall, the ivory-bills held the city rapt. Everyone had a story to tell of how the birds had flown right over their yard, or pecked at their very own cypress, or landed an air-raid dropping right splat on Great Aunt Jessie\u2019s best Sunday bonnet. Stores that sold binoculars couldn\u2019t keep them in stock. Murals appeared on formerly derelict buildings, depicting the birds in full color, thirty feet tall\u2014and then the buildings changed hands, got renovated, and filled up with woodpecker-crazy tenants.\nThe mayor and Katie and all the mayor\u2019s staff worked like dogs, amazed to discover just how much there was to do once a city allowed ambition to trample ennui. With money in the coffers, and more pouring in every day, every department dreamed better dreams, then shoved those dreams toward reality. New parks and bike trails appeared, roadways underwent long-overdue repairs, and brand-new bus lines trundled around unexpected corners. It was an all-at-once avalanche of urban renewal.\nRoy Bentham died October fifth, a Friday. Janet found him when she came in from a fundraising party (a fundraiser she hardly needed, since her reelection was now entirely assured). Roy lay sprawled across the bed, felled by a massive coronary. His black-socked feet were still on the floor, and the mug of milk he\u2019d set out for Janet steamed gently beneath the orangey glow of the bedside light. Janet shook his shoulder, once, just to be sure, and then, feeling wooden, dry-throated, she walked quickly back to the kitchen, picked up the phone, and called not the police or her pastor, but Katie Glynn.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t think who else to call.\u201d\nShe grieved, of course, but she was so busy\u2014the work of being mayor had become so frantic\u2014that for long months, she did not miss Roy so much as note his absence. Then, in February, with a furious ice storm snapping branches and toppling power lines, she found herself not resting in bed where she needed to be but huddled in a corner of the bathroom, and she could not rise, she could not cry out, she could only tremble on the floor, her body wrapped in a fat terry cloth bathrobe, flamingo pink, warm and soft. She shuddered dry, tectonic sobs and thought, Dear God, how did I get to be so lonely?\nIn the kitchen, the telephone rang.\nThat, she thought, would be Ed Brauner at Transportation, or maybe Police Chief Dan Vaughn. It was getting bad out there, the trees were really popping now, and most departments were in crisis mode. Katie was still at work, of course, refusing to abandon the ship.\nThe phone rang again, and now her cell was buzzing. Out of reach, the both of them, but the mayor could not bring herself to rise. She did not want to talk to her department chiefs, not even for the sake of her city, her flourishing city. Not tonight. Tonight, just for once, she wanted to let loneliness settle. She felt a primal need to suffer.\nThe answering machine in the kitchen picked up. No voicemail, not for the mayor. Roy had preferred not to modernize quite so much, quite so fast. \u201cNothing wrong with the old answering machine,\u201d he\u2019d said when she\u2019d proposed switching. \u201cShame to just throw it out.\u201d\n\u201cHello, dearie,\u201d said a voice, a quavering soprano that whispered its way out of the kitchen, ghosted down the hall, and sidled its way into the bathroom. \u201cI know you\u2019re home\u2014but I understand. Call back when you can. Let me know how those pets of yours are doing, all right? You know which line to use. Love you, Sugarlumps. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\nClick.\nHer eyes flew wide; she pressed her spine to the wall. Images of the Eastlake Victorian careened past, instantly replaced by equally vivid memories of the salvage yard with its wide, forsaken aisles, each one leading to an ugly, well-preserved telephone.\nThe ice stopped falling at six the next morning, and for two weeks, the mayor had no time to be lonely. She worked eighteen hours a day, more, to get her pulverized city back on its feet, to return power to its shivering, in-the-dark citizens. But at last the final out-of-state power crews drove off, and the mayor, forgetting to thank Katie (who had worked harder than anyone), took herself home, on time, to the hazards of an empty house.\nShe made it through the winter, bleak as it was, and she made it through spring on the strength of blooms and buds and a city that loved her. Summer was long, hot\u2014hotter than usual\u2014but the swelter became, in its way, its own barrier against temptation.\nAnd then\u2014like magic\u2014summer was gone. The city\u2019s children, in bright columns, filed back into their schools. On the trees, the leaves colored and crinkled, then drifted to the ground, too crippled to rise. October was at the mayor\u2019s throat almost before she knew it.\nOctober.\nSomewhere out in the Mouse Creek bottomlands, two famous woodpeckers huddled together, fifty feet up in the hollow of a towering tulip. It was late, well past dark, the air cooling and crisp. Normally the birds would have been fast asleep, but instead they fluffed their feathers uneasily, weighed down with a nameless, dread disquiet. Had they been able to speak, one would certainly have said to the other, \u201cSomething just stepped on my grave.\u201d\nThey were only birds, after all. Two birds that were, sooner or later, doomed. Neither was surprised when in the distance, they caught the sound of a garage door opening. A car backing up. They could even hear, in their way, the thudding, miserable heartbeat of the driver within, and her needful certainty that somewhere in all the crap of Don\u2019s Salvage Yard, there would surely be one other working telephone.\nMark Rigney is the author of numerous plays, including Ten Red Kings and Acts of God (both from Playscripts, Inc.), as well as Bears, winner of the 2012 Panowski Playwriting Competition (during its off-Broadway run, Theatre Mania called Bears \u201cthe best play of the year\u201d).

Fine basaltic dust drifted lazily down onto the regolith. This lunar rock was tough, baked in solar furnaces at the birth of the solar system. Whatever its secrets, they would not come easily.\nI stopped and withdrew the drill bit. The suit fans whirred a little faster now, but I would have given anything to be able to wipe away the little beads of sweat with the back of my hand. The hole, just a finger\u2019s width, was shallow. A dozen others riddled the rock face, lit by portable lamps now the sun had set below the crater\u2019s rim. If we\u2019d hoped this facet would simply flake away, we were in for a disappointment.\nBut then I saw something. Deep in the heart of the hole, a glint of silver: a polished metal surface where none should be. After all the false alarms and disappointments, could this really be a remnant?\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Helena said.\nWe called ourselves the Ageless Ones.\nEven that was a lie\u2014or at least a subtle, ego-flattering adaption of the truth. Those of us who chose lifespans best measured in centuries (and troublingly, some did not) carried nanomachines in our bloodstreams to purify and repair. Perhaps in our agelessness, we had become a little like them, more machinelike and less human. Less fallible.\nBut we could thank good old relativistic time dilation for our main claim to longevity. That, and the passing of a few millennia in fugue sleep while our ships laboured across the gulfs between the stars. So we were not truly ageless, but the galaxies did grow older while we slept.\nWe were the travellers who turned our backs on mankind\u2019s birthplace for a chance of immortality. We weren\u2019t the first to try, but we were the first to succeed.\nIt was a chamber, an elongated room shaped more or less as the gravitics had hinted. Once there must have been a door, but with the chamber entombed in that unyielding basalt, we opted to cut our way in through this first point of contact. Ultimately it made no difference: vacuum without, vacuum within.\nWe hoped for wonders from a bygone era, but what we got was a junk room, a store cupboard at best. The ancient inscriptions were not immediately decipherable, but the ship\u2019s databases remembered the languages of our distant ancestors and translated for us.\nA museum, of sorts.\nStill we didn\u2019t understand. Not then.\nOnly one ship had returned to the home system. After a million years (or perhaps two, or three) there was a certain inevitability to it. Curiosity compelled us to see where humankind had arisen. Not our birthplace, for we were shipborn creatures, but we felt the bond nonetheless. As predicted, we found Earth dead and devoid of all life. The moon, grey and airless, still the faithful companion. A little more distant now, but there, just as the ship remembered.\nIn the passing of a thousand shipborn generations Earth had changed, burnt and poisoned, returned to a rocky lifeless ball much as it must have been at the birth of the solar system. Like a nest nurturing hatchlings until they\u2019re old enough to fly, it had served its purpose and now lay ruined, dismantled by the fledglings in their struggle to leave the nest.\nThe ship was\u2014had always been\u2014our home. And yet. . . . During this brief sojourn from it, Helena and I walked the lunar surface sometimes, suited hand in suited hand, the formalities of her command put to one side, and I felt something close to happiness.\nWe all dreamt of what it must feel like to walk in the open air, warm sun on our backs and wind against our faces. The shipboard simulations could only go so far. But this was not enough either.\nAnd at night, in her eyes I thought I saw something, a kind of cold despair. Or maybe just tiredness. It became an unspoken barrier between us. I knew Helena had decided not to enter the fugue-sleep chamber again\u2014and I wondered what I would do without her, journeying on alone.\nThe vacuum-sealed box seemed to be all that remained intact. (And the irony was not lost on us: vacuum sealed? On the moon?)\nInside\u2014\nBlade, the inscription said, repeated in three different prehistoric languages. The rest of the description we did not understand.\nThere were protocols for this kind of thing. Scientific methods to preserve irreplaceable artefacts. But there was also human curiosity, undimmed with the passage of millennia.\nSo we opened it.\nInside we truly found a wonder. It might even have been the first of its kind. I imagined the pride felt by some ancient curator carefully placing it in the delicate glass case\u2014pride at the magnificent audacity of all that it represented. The single blade of grass and seed-head, long since brown and desiccated, had obviously grown tall and strong in the one-sixth gravity. I pictured the lowland dunes where it must have flourished, bathed in sunlight while Earth looked on. This, the first blade of grass naturally cultivated on the moon.\nOn its unprotected surface.\nDisturbed by the opening of the container, it crumbled to a fine dust.\nIt will take time\u2014much time, all are agreed. Eons will pass while the task is executed. But aren\u2019t we supposed to be the masters of time, the Ageless Ones? Once the work is set in motion and we retire to our fugue-sleep chambers, the passing of millennia is but a good night\u2019s rest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have hope again,\u201d Helena says to me. She will sleep again, after all.\nWe have a shared dream\u2014to walk the lowland plains above Mare Vaporum, or climb into the Apennine foothills and gaze across the green slopes toward the shoreline of Mare Imbrium, where waves break languidly. To breathe that oxygen-rich air and pluck the wild flowers which grow in the meadows. Perhaps we will gaze up at that brown, lifeless orb hanging low on the eastern horizon and think dangerous thoughts.\nAnd we too will leave our legacy. Deep in that same museum vault: a blade of grass to replace the one we carelessly destroyed, plucked from the second greening of the moon.\nDavid Cleden writes business proposals by day and fantasy stories by night and tries hard not to get the two jobs muddled up.

She always thought about things first before asking Nana, and there was plenty of time for thinking whenever Ragene sat in that chair.\n\u201cNana, why is my hair like this?\u201d\nNana grabbed a plug of curls and ran a sizzling comb with metal teeth through the bunch.\n\u201cBecause you were born beneath the sun, child. Everybody knows that little girls born beneath the sun had better have straight, long hair if they are to get anywhere in this land.\u201d\n\u201cBut what do you mean, \u2018get anywhere\u2019?\u201d asked Ragene, holding her head as stiff a possum.\n\u201cI mean get anywhere,\u201d said Nana as she stuffed the comb back into the tiny stove. \u201cIn this land, there is no room for forest-hair because people are afraid it will keep growing and break through the ceiling, and nobody wants that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, will it break through the ceiling?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I can\u2019t afford to fix nobody\u2019s ceiling, so hush up and keep still.\u201d\nNana was a hair presser and a damn good one. She traveled to France in the 1920s when the hot comb was first invented. You see, the hot comb was a heavy comb with metal teeth and a wooden handle. A magic comb made to transform women with coarse curly hair into women with fine straight hair. After practicing abroad, Nana returned and opened a home salon, where she flicked her wrist and pressed many forest-heads. But Nana was most proud of the work she had done on Ragene\u2019s hair.\nNana checked the comb\u2019s temperature with a towel. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done with you, you will be the most beautiful beneath the sun!\u201d\nFor Ragene, however, getting her hair pressed was the most boring process in the world, which took, on average, six whole hours. She never opened her eyes for any of it because she was always frightened that even the slightest movement on her part would award her a scalp scab, and everybody knows that scalp scabs are for tender heads who can\u2019t keep still. Ragene only ever opened her eyes when she heard Nana cut off the stove. The room would be congested with smoke and a pungent burning stench that settled in Ragene\u2019s clothes. Ragene would jump up and dash across the room to the mirror and run her fingers through the hair, which fell twelve inches down her back. It felt like bird feathers. It was long and straight and shiny like black diamonds, which made other girls want to touch her non-forest diamond-hair.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone touch your hair, y\u2019hear?\u201d Nana would warn while setting up for her next client, waving her hot comb. \u201cI mean it, child. If you do, I\u2019ll pop you one good.\u201d\nPoor Ragene tried to heed her Nana\u2019s warning, but it was impossible for the girls at the all-girls school to keep their frolicking fingers to themselves. Every time they touched her hair, it would bush up again, and Nana would become highly irritated. To avoid getting popped, Ragene lied and told her Nana that a ventilator in class had caused the frizz. But she knew she could not keep the fib going for long. Ragene felt quite desperate to stay on Nana\u2019s good side. She couldn\u2019t stop the girls from touching her hair, but what she could do was turn their paws into profits.\nAt recess, Ragene set up a desk and chair in the center of an empty classroom. On the desk was a water basin, a stack of paper towels, a money cup, and a cardboard sign that read \u201cPetting Park\u201d in big, bold crayon. She would charge a cent a minute to any girl who wanted to play in her hair. This way, she could pay Nana for all her hard work.\nShe sat perfectly still in the chair and opened her hair. Girls from all over school crowded around for the park with jingling coin purses. They lifted the hair and twisted the hair and sniffed and parted and braided the hair. They had too good a time playing in the Petting Park, but soon the hair began to do strange things. It drew back like a snake and became very coarse, as if the hair were tired of being tampered with. The girls could no longer play without cutting up their fingers. One time, a fat girl\u2019s finger got stuck in the hair, and it took three whole kids to pull it back out. Cannibal hair, some called it. Most girls were fine with cannibal hair\u2014they liked being scared\u2014but a few asked for their money back. The hair\u2019s behavior was a big mystery to Ragene. She had never fully seen her natural hair.\nRagene wanted to ask Nana, but she could not do so without having to explain how her hair changed in the first place. But the secret got out anyway on Ragene\u2019s twelfth birthday, no thanks to Nana\u2019s clients, parents of Ragene\u2019s schoolmates, who had been getting their hair pressed for so long they had forgotten what their natural hair looked like. In the salon, the women lifted their conditioned heads out of washbowls and gossiped about how their girls came home from some park and tracked unusual hair into the house, spoiling the good carpet. Dark, kinky hair that the parents shook out of shoes and socks and pulled from ears and fingernails. Nearby, sweeping the floor, Ragene stiffened as the women carried on.\n\u201cJust awful. . . . Isn\u2019t it awful?\u201d said one woman.\n\u201cAtrocious!\u201d said another.\n\u201cUgh, what kind of park you think it is that gets hair all over them like that?\u201d\n\u201cMine won\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\u201cMine either. . . . \u2018A park,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking her child, \u201csimply \u2018a park.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the hair, but the kind of hair that really concerns me\u2014like animal\u2019s hair.\u201d\n\u201cCould be dangerous.\u201d\nLater that night, Nana questioned Ragene about this park as they sat alone at a small kitchen table, lighting the birthday cake. Ragene blinked. Nana grabbed her chin and pulled her face close, leaving only a hair space between them. \u201cDon\u2019t you play dumb with me.\u201d\nRagene dug in her pockets and pulled out ten dollars in coins, confessed about the Petting Park, and handed Nana the money.\n\u201cSee, Nana, I was being an entrepreneur like you.\u201d\nNana seized Ragene by the ear and snatched the hot comb from the stove. She popped her one, parching the gristle good.\nRagene shrieked and clutched her ear.\n\u201cYou little good-for-nothing,\u201d said Nana. \u201cLook what you made me do!\u201d\nRagene stumbled and staggered and became very faint, and soon she drifted out of consciousness.\nShe awoke some time later in a spare, dimly lit room and dressed like a penitent in a hair shirt. There was a mattress, a toilet, and a rocking chair in the corner, where Nana sat staring at her. She held Ragene\u2019s birthday cake, not saying a word, which made Ragene very uncomfortable.\nPoof! Nana blew out the twelve candles. She twirled a tress of the girl\u2019s half-straightened hair around her finger.\n\u201cYou will grow your hair to its rightful length, or I will never let you out,\u201d said Nana. \u201cIt may not look like it, but I\u2019m doing this for your own good.\u201d\nAnd with that, she disappeared out a tiny window.\nRagene feared her Nana very much at this point, for she had never seen her behave like that before. She waited a moment or two before she crept over to the window and peeked out.\nThe tower was a monstrosity, cold and ugly. It had neither stairs nor door, only that tiny window set very much at the top. Down below lay a grove of trees. Evidently, Nana had trimmed Ragene\u2019s hair and made herself an actual forest filled with ominous sounds\u2014Nana could do more with hair than straighten it when she wanted to. Whatever made those sounds never came out of the forest, at least not in the daytime when Ragene could get a good look at them.\nPoor Ragene could do nothing but sit there at that window, singing and praying for God to grow her hair to its rightful length, whatever that was, or for the forest things to come out and keep her company. Ragene longed for company. Nana had stopped really talking with Ragene, which was very much unlike her. Nana had always been kind and loving to the girl. But where was she now, this kind and loving Nana of hers? The only time she spoke to Ragene was to check the length of her hair.\nNana would stand at the foot of the tower and call out, \u201cWhat will make you beautiful beneath the sun?\u201d\nAt this point, Ragene would stop her singing and praying to let her hair slither out the window. If the length of the hair did not reach Nana, she would scurry all the way to the top and parch the girl\u2019s ear again for making her move so fast and crawl so high.\n\u201cNow, if you won\u2019t grow your hair, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d Nana huffed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to burn you up.\u201d Nana stared at Ragene when she said this, letting her know that she really did mean it.\nRagene spent her days weeping onto the floor because her Nana wanted her to have impossible fairy-tale hair and because she had been popped so many times that her ear was blotched with white. At one point, in a fit of frustration, Ragene ripped up her mattress and threw the tender stuffing all over, and when she went to gather it all up she found, buried in the heap, a very small television with a cracked screen. She set the television on her lap and twisted and turned the knobs and antenna, and slapped the box good. Still, she got nothing. One time, however, the television flickered on without Ragene bothering it and, on the screen, played a strange commercial:\nTwo brown girls, one with long, straight hair and one with short, kinky hair, stood onstage in an auditorium, wearing school uniforms and facing an audience. A rambunctious announcer popped onto the screen. He had large metal teeth and a great big grin, and he clutched a microphone.\n\u201cHello there, ladies,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me, what will make you beautiful beneath the sun?\u201d\nHe thrust the mic into the face of the kinky-haired girl, who stuttered and sputtered and sweat like an idiot, unable to give an answer. But the straight-haired girl was relaxed and calm and had no trouble giving a response when the mic was in her face.\n\u201cThat would be . . . my hair!\u201d\nThe second she answered, the kinky-haired girl burst into confetti, exploding into the cheering auditorium. The announcer hauled out a fat check for a thousand dollars. Then the screen buzzed and cut off.\nRagene stared into the box with thoughtful eyes. I must be going mad. She walked over to the window, looked down at the ground so far away, and inhaled. One could easily get down\u2014splat!\u2014that\u2019s all it would take.\nA year or two passed and Ragene stopped caring about things. Her hair knotted and became full of dust and the dead hair of clients that Nana tracked in whenever she came up the tower. Ragene never bothered cleaning any of the hair up, or the cotton from the mattress, even though Nana brought up a thread and needle and told her to fix up her bed. But anyway, the way the dead hair had knotted into hers, Ragene noticed on yet another dreadfully dull night, made her hair appear longer than its true length. Naturally, an idea came to Ragene, and she gathered all the loose hair from the floor and bent her sewing needle in the shape of a hook.\nRight away, Ragene stitched the dead hair into her own, and her hair became magnificent and longer than ever and looked very much real. It felt quite strange at first, but she got used to it quickly. When Nana called up to her, Ragene hitched a braid of her new hair out the window, and it fell all the way to the ground for the first time. Nana was unable to tell the difference, but even though she made it to the top, she was only somewhat pleased.\n\u201cLonger,\u201d said Nana, once she was inside.\n\u201cBut Nana\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou must be longer than the longest and straighter than the straightest,\u201d said Nana, \u201cif you want to have any chance of being anything good in this land.\u201d\nRagene sat at the window each day, weaving her hair a ridiculous length and singing songs to pass the time. She had stopped praying to God long ago, because, clearly, he was not into matters of the hair.\nOne night, after Nana had just left the tower, she came back and cried up to Ragene again. She must have left something behind, thought Ragene. She is getting very old and forgetful. As usual, Ragene let down her hair, but the person who tumbled in through the window was not Nana.\nIt was a man. An expensive-looking man. Everything about him twinkled, even his eyes when he stared at her. She had never seen a man before.\n\u201cI hope you are not alarmed,\u201d said the man.\nHe walked around the small space and made himself too much at home. He then explained that his sister was a client of Nana\u2019s, who was perched beneath a hair dryer in the salon. Bored with waiting, he had wandered the forest and spied Nana climbing the tower.\nRagene noticed a bulge in his tight pants, some kind of tail, she supposed.\n\u201cAre you a forest thing?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cForest thing? Ha! Men like me are not forest things. My name is Harry, son of the king.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you are not a forest thing, then what are you?\u201d\nThe man laughed awkwardly. \u201cMy dear, I am an escape artist,\u201d he said, even though he failed every escapology course and never graduated. \u201cAnd what might you be?\u201d\n\u201cI am the most beautiful beneath the sun,\u201d Ragene said, unconvincingly.\n\u201cYes, yes, it seems so,\u201d he said, stroking her fabulous hair. \u201cAnd it would be a real pity for you not to enjoy your enviable reputation. Come with me.\u201d\nHe hoped he was persuasive enough. Harry was very skilled at making friends with fabled girls like Ragene but was, in truth, none too crazy about bedding them. This was a secret he had kept from his father, for he knew the king would call his proclivity unnatural. But alas, he was determined to make dear old daddy proud. Perhaps rescuing and marrying a damsel from a tower would do the trick.\n\u201cHow can I trust you?\u201d asked Ragene. She pointed to the bulge in his pants. \u201cYou have a tail in the front, for goodness\u2019 sake.\u201d\nHarry looked down, then dug into his tight pants and showed her the \u201ctail,\u201d a sad-looking thing with one small eye. \u201cGo ahead, touch it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a tail with an eye before. What will it do to me?\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, it will perk up and Father will be pleased with me.\u201d He moved closer, flicking the thing. \u201cGo on, it\u2019s perfectly natural.\u201d\nAfter years of isolation, Ragene was having trust issues. If she touched it, she thought, she might risk losing her fingers. But if she didn\u2019t touch it, she would never know anything. Ragene was bored with not knowing, and curiosity got the better of her. She reached out and patted the poor tail, then snatched back her hand quite quickly.\nThe tail magically perked up for a moment, then recoiled. Harry sighed, defeated. Ragene clapped her hands, delighted. Already this non-forest thing had shown her things Nana had never.\n\u201cIf I go with you,\u201d said Ragene, \u201cI will have to find a way down from here.\u201d\nAfter she said this, a brilliant idea came to her. She told Harry all he had to do was bring her skeins of dead hair each time he went to Nana\u2019s salon with his sister, and she would weave herself a ladder.\nHarry frowned. \u201cNow that you know all my secrets, I\u2019d be a fool to take you with me.\u201d\n\u201cHonest, I\u2019ll marry you, and your secrets will be safe with me. I only wish to get out of here, to make secrets of my own. You\u2019ll have yours. I\u2019ll have mine. We\u2019ll be perfectly happy.\u201d\nRagene pushed him toward the window.\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you expect me to get all that hair to you?\u201d\n\u201cYou seem like a man of many resources, Harry.\u201d She stuffed her hair into his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out!\u201d\nAnd out the window he went.\nOnce a week, Harry returned, carrying a skein of hair up his sleeve. Hair from all over the world. Ragene had to pick out all sorts of foreign things from the hair before sewing it up into a ladder, such as a Himalayan mountain chunk or a few stones from the Great Wall of China and other treasures that only made her more anxious to get free.\nOne time, the two were a hair\u2019s breadth from getting caught. Nana had dropped in for a surprise visit and Harry had to hide in the hair, crawling down ever so stealthily as Nana clambered her way up. Nana stopped many times along the way to cough or blow her nose or bitch about how old she was getting. But apart from that instance, Nana had not let on that she suspected anything.\nIt happened one evening that Ragene was shaking out strands from a Rajasthan desert when she heard the wonted call and forgot to keep her wits about her.\n\u201cWhat will make you beautiful beneath the sun?\u201d a raspy voice called out.\nHumming to herself, she let her hair cascade to the ground and felt Harry a-tugging. She was so sure it was Harry, for he came only at night and Nana at day.\n\u201cIt amazes me how much lighter than my nana you have become,\u201d said Ragene, lighting a candle. \u201cWhat have you been dieting on, my friend?\u201d\nBut when she held up the light, she saw that it was not Harry who crawled into her window.\nNana glared at her. \u201cWhat did I hear you say?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, Nana,\u201d said Ragene. \u201cYou heard nothing.\u201d\nNana rubbed her leaky eyes and blew her nose on Ragene\u2019s hair as she stepped around the room, eyeing the Indian strand on the floor.\n\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done to protect you from this godforsaken world, you go and deceive me again?\u201d\nNana mustered up all her strength and strapped Ragene to the rocking chair. She turned the heat on her hot iron way up. She scorched out every strand of the girl\u2019s hair, then wrapped Ragene\u2019s bald head up so tight in a scarf that her ears bled.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t scalp you,\u201d said Nana, \u201cfor all the pain you\u2019ve brought me.\u201d\nBut Nana was more pitiless than she made herself out to be. She flung Ragene and the desert as far as she could out the window, and the girl landed facedown on a sand dune.\nOn that same day, Harry came calling for Ragene as usual and the hair fell down as usual, so he suspected nothing. However, at the top, Nana waited with a pair of sharp scissors. When the man reached the window, Nana jabbed him in his eye, and he fell back into a bush of thorns, where a very large thorn pierced his other eye. The wretched man crawled around the forest, quite blind and unable to find his way, eating beetles and earthworms and tree roots for some years until he finally chanced upon the desert.\nRagene wandered the desert in great grief and misery, for freedom was not what she expected. It did nothing to compensate for being estranged from Nana. But it seemed like she might have enjoyed the lifestyle, at least at first. The despair she attributed to the clear and present fact that no one would look upon her, and those who did had disapproving eyes. There, Ragene lived among beggars and untouchables but never really found her tribe. For a box of matches, one group sold her to another, who bound her in chains and made her dance each night for their dinner show. They lit a fire and had her cover her head, only to uncover it at the end of the performance so they could all jump and scream and feign terror at the sight of her new growth. She became numb to the gyrating because they fed her and gave her a place to sleep and, at the very least, they so much as looked at her, which was something.\nRagene had broken away from the dancing group (or, rather, they grew bored with her routine and moved on to other entertainments) when she saw Harry again. He had escaped from the forest. He was missing two eyes and was malnourished and, plainly put, didn\u2019t look so hot. But he smiled when he heard a voice that seemed so familiar to him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re about as worse off as I am, my friend,\u201d said Ragene. \u201cWhat happened? Were you captured, too?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear, I am an escape artist. I can never be captured or detained, only distracted,\u201d he said weakly before he broke down, dropping into her arms. \u201cTwo vicious females attacked me! The first was your Nana, who mutilated my eyes with her hair clippers. The second was the forest, who trapped me between her thick, bushy limbs\u2014the harlot!\u2014and refused to let me go.\u201d\n\u201cBut we are both alive and free . . . well, maybe not so much free, as freedom is not so simple as living. But we are alive! And the \u2018free\u2019 part we can figure out together.\u201d\n\u201cGood point,\u201d he said, catching on. \u201cThen let\u2019s try to be optimistic for survival.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Ragene said, indicating his tail. \u201cAfter all, you still have one good eye left.\u201d\n\u201cAnother point well made,\u201d he said. \u201cBut enough of me, what about you . . . dare I ask it?\u201d\n\u201cAsk what? \u2018What will make you beautiful beneath the sun?\u2019\u201d she mocked.\nRagene patted her short wooly Afro, realizing just how little she knew of her herself. Struck by a sudden sadness, perhaps from all her years of living in the dark, Ragene wept without sound over the non-forest thing in tattered tight pants, and two tears wetted his eyes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a little rainfall,\u201d he said.\nRagene wiped her eyes. \u201cSo we are.\u201d\n\u201cThis means a short period of great abundance is coming!\u201d\nNow, these two tears were not made to cure Harry\u2019s blindness, as one can expect in fairy tales. Her tears had, however, done something else. Something quite unusual. With wetted palms, Ragene patted and massaged her itchy, dry head, unknowingly rubbing tears into her scalp. At once, her natural hair sprouted! Upward and outward it went, traveling at a rapid pace through her fingers. It grew to be the size of an umbrella and well beyond that, and Ragene\u2019s eyes twinkled with wonder under the beam of light.\nAsia Nichols is a Bay Area\u2013born writer who lives out of her backpack.

So much air for all their lungs. So much water, and even though not all their mouths wanted food, the ones that did needed so much. And no wonder. They had to keep all those legs moving. And just think of the shoes. A whole department store full of clothes, and so much time to make them fit their body, to sew new holes and close old ones. So much time to keep their body clean. So many haircuts, Mom sweeping the fallen locks into corn-colored mounds on the kitchen floor. Think of all the blood their body needed just to keep them going, how much ran through their veins. The same blood as mine, only so much more. Think of the room they needed. The house grew right along with them. They needed so much air, water, space, time, love.\n* * *\nWhen Eddy was born they were already budding, and we thought it was a birth defect or some genetic disease. Something rare, but understood. Maybe there was a cure, or it would go away, or there were others like Eddy that we might meet and share our lives with, the troubles and the funny little things they did. We didn\u2019t know Eddy would keep on budding, more and more added to the first like beads to a string until they were a hundred feet long by eight years old: a necklace for the hills they played on back then. We have a lot of land and they could hide there, in the hills or cornfields or by the marsh, in the cattails where the red-winged blackbirds sang.\nPretty soon we knew there was nothing like Eddy in the world. Mom told them that once, when they were little and I was too, only not a baby, old enough to remember. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like you in the whole wide world,\u201d and she smiled. She loved them just as much as she loved me, if not a little more. Dad, too, in his own way. Men have a harder time when their kids don\u2019t turn out like them, but he loved us. One time, when people came to the door wanting to make a movie about Eddy, Dad drove them off and that was that. He scared them good.\nAnd Eddy loved us back, but I think they loved the cornfields most of all. The fields and the birds that flew above them: starlings, sparrows, crows, and Canada geese. You could hear Eddy from the house, their many hands and feet making crunchy rustling noises in the cornfield that seemed to stretch as far as you could see when you were young. When the farmers made a maze of it in autumn, Eddy went there at night, and I would look out my bedroom window on the second floor of the house and see, once in a while, a pale shape weaving its way through the corn stalks. It was Eddy, naked at last, running round and round the maze, almost tying themself in a knot until they came to meet\u2014one end to the other\u2014in the center. They solved the maze that way and thought it was so funny. I can still hear them laughing. All the mouths that could, laughing.\n* * *\nIt was a warm autumn twenty years ago that Eddy came back home one day when they were supposed to be somewhere else, I don\u2019t know where, and curled up on the floor of their old bedroom, which had long ago gone to dust and cobwebs and those big plastic bins we keep all our old stuff in. I was lying on the couch, just resting, feeling pretty good about life, and listening to little clicks behind me that were ladybugs flitting around the lamp, their hard wing casings striking the plastic lampshade. They were taking over the house, more every day, because it was so warm and the neighbors released a bunch, bought on the computer and shipped from somewhere else, to protect their plants. I was bitten by a mosquito on the 26th of October that year. Isn\u2019t that something? I was feeling really wonderful that evening, like I did when I was a teenager. Kind of invincible and alive. What is it about a warm October that makes you feel young again?\nBut then Eddy came in the house like that, all silent and still, like they were possessed.\n\u201cEddy?\u201d I said and repeated, but they went right up the stairs and into their old bedroom.\nThey were crying, the kind of crying that makes you bob up and down a little bit. Sobbing, I guess you\u2019d call it. I sat down next to them and took one of their hands in mine.\n\u201cWhat happened, Eddy?\u201d\nSo many tears, and not even all their eyes could cry. Their tears gathered in the center of the floor where the boards sagged a bit. A ladybug got caught in the stream and floated away.\n\u201cDid someone hurt you?\u201d Was that a nod, or maybe their heads were just shaking from the sobs. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not upset about a name or somethin\u2019.\u201d We got over that real early on.\nThey picked grass and weeds from their shoes, out of the creases and the places they were falling apart. They had tracked mud all across the carpet.\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d I said. \u201cSo help me if somebody hurt you.\u201d\nEddy looked out the window then, all the heads made for looking, and there was something strange in that row of watery eyes. Something raw and wild and haunted. They couldn\u2019t put it into words, what they had seen or heard or had done to them or done themself. So I just sat with them a while until I had to help Mom out of the bath.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay?\u201d\nThey nodded.\nWhen I came back, they were sleeping, all in a pile like usual, one head on the next shoulder in line.\n* * *\nWhat did Eddy see that day in this wide old country? I\u2019ve seen enough things to scare a ghost in these cornfields and barnyards. There are strange people out here and farther south too, \u201cthe south of the north\u201d they call it, I guess because the people are set in their ways and don\u2019t like people that aren\u2019t like them, like blacks and gays and people who don\u2019t believe in God. I\u2019ve seen them out here, the Goddess types. They used the foundation of an old silo for their festivals and feasts. Part of the ventilation system\u2014a way to cool down the silo when it got too hot\u2014was overgrown with weeds and made a big green V in the concrete, which I guess looked like magic to their wondering eyes. In the spring, flowers bloomed there.\nBut what Eddy saw was something else. I went out the next few days and wandered the fields and trespassed quite a bit. I found an old dog house on stilts in the woods, raccoon shit everywhere, and somebody\u2019s lost rototiller getting buried in leaves, about to be lost for good. That was by the old crick that trickled behind the hills behind our house, but there was nothing there that could have haunted a man.\nThen again, Eddy\u2019s not really a man, are they?\nEddy has more brains than anyone else. Really. I once heard that if you unravel a man\u2019s brains it would stretch the length of a football field. Just imagine how far Eddy\u2019s goes. They had a memory like you wouldn\u2019t believe, and maybe what they say about us only using a tiny part of our brain is true. And maybe Eddy could use all of it, or at least more than us, so they could see something in the fields and ditches that I couldn\u2019t.\nWhatever it was, it made Eddy quiet and still. They stared a lot, out the window or into the sink. I thought they would be like that forever, but then they changed after a few days. They were suddenly giddy and talkative and animated. They were bouncing with nervous energy like I\u2019d never seen.\n\u201cDo you ever think about having kids?\u201d Eddy asked me about a week later. They were moving back home because the landlady that let them rent went to rehab, and someone else was taking over. And this new guy didn\u2019t make exceptions.\n\u201cNah,\u201d I said, and chuckled and wondered. Now why did I lie about that?\n\u201cI do,\u201d Eddy said.\nMaybe because they had been strange lately. \u201cYou do? Well. I mean. Can you even?\u201d\nThey were good at moving because they could be inside and out at the same time and hand boxes down the length of their body, and then I\u2019d place them inside where we wanted them. And Eddy had a lot of stuff, most of it practical, like clothes and toothbrushes and toilet paper.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d they said. \u201cBut you really never think about it?\u201d\nEddy knew I was lying. They\u2019re bright like that, with all those brains. They sense what\u2019s hiding. \u201cYeah, all right. I have. But I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d I looked around for Mom. \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom.\u201d They smiled. \u201cOkay, well. I don\u2019t think I like girls.\u201d\nEddy went quiet and scratched an itch on one of the smaller buds, one of the armless ones. Maybe it was for digestion or something. After a minute, they spoke up. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nThey weren\u2019t angry, maybe just disappointed. \u201cI dunno. I was planning to. Things just kept coming up.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cOkay, okay. Truth is I just found out myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cCouple weeks ago.\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. A little confused. But kinda excited too, you know? I mean, it\u2019s a new me.\u201d\n\u201cI tried it once,\u201d they said. They grinned and blushed, and I giggled. \u201cWith myself.\u201d\n\u201cWith yourself!\u201d\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cI can see why you might want to be.\u201d\nWe had a good laugh and Eddy dropped a box and something broke, which made us laugh a little more.\n\u201cSo, Eddy, do you think you can have kids?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It should be possible, right? Unless.\u201d\nUnless Eddy\u2019s a defect, which we had been over already, enough times for them to know better.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s just a matter of trying. I mean, you have all the parts.\u201d I chuckled, and we both went silent because we were wondering the same thing: would they be like Eddy? I broke the silence. \u201cYou\u2019re a new kind of person, Eddy, so we just have to find out how it happens by ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want you to help.\u201d\nThat was a joke too, and Eddy seemed to be back to normal. We moved them home, and Mom was happy. Sometimes I think she thought they never left, but maybe that was just an old wish rising up inside her. They seemed happy and we had a lot of talks like we used to, over tea or a little whiskey, which they liked more than I do. They never got drunk though. I don\u2019t think it was possible. Too much blood.\nSo everything was normal, except that every evening around dinner, about 5:30, which was when it was getting dark after Daylight Savings Time ended, they would go all still and silent again, and I would wonder. What ghosts did they dig up out there?\n* * *\nAnd then Eddy got sick. It started with sore throats, which went away, and thank God because Mom and I couldn\u2019t sleep with all the coughing. But then they were pissing blood a few weeks later. They were curious, but I was scared. It could have been cancer. I came into the bathroom and they were staring at it in a plastic cup. It looked like pink lemonade.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m urinating blood.\u201d\n\u201cIs it coming from . . . all of your . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cJust the penises.\u201d\nWe had to find a doctor who would let them in the office, and that took almost a month. It was another three weeks before they could go in, and then the doctors did all the tests on every bud on his body. There were ultrasounds and CAT scans and then the worst of all: some kind of scope that slid right inside his penises. I saw the thing beforehand. A black tube with a light at the end like some kind of evil cyclops snake. It was so thick I thought it would split them right open. I wanted to help them through it, but I had to leave or I would\u2019ve fainted.\nI think Eddy took it pretty well. They found it interesting. Or they\u2019d distract themself with books. They had such good focus that they could read a book and hardly notice getting pricked with needles and scopes. They could read more than one book at a time, and they read about all kinds of things, all sorts of books checked out of the library: literature, philosophy, and a lot of books about animals, some we had around here, like birds, and some we didn\u2019t, like jellyfish and stuff.\nThe doctors charged us for each one. When it would have helped Eddy to be many, they were one, and when it would have helped them to be one, they were many. We got bills forever, and we sent away all our savings and some of Mom\u2019s. That made Eddy cry the most, I think, using Mom\u2019s money.\nBut Mom, when she was thinking clearly in the early morning, would just hold what she could of Eddy and hum and tell them it was okay. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, my little mullein. It\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have anything to worry about today.\u201d She\u2019d say that over and over until they were calm or fell asleep.\nWhat really got me was that the doctors never found what made Eddy pee blood. I got so mad I made some nasty phone calls. I was so mad I just went outside one night and screamed at the top of my lungs because I didn\u2019t know what else to do. That scared Eddy, and me.\n* * *\nThat was when Eddy had to get a job. Growing up, they sometimes did odd jobs around the farms, repairs and stuff. There was no danger for them going up high, into silos and on roofs. They couldn\u2019t fall and hurt themselves, so everyone appreciated it. But that wasn\u2019t enough anymore because they wanted to earn back Mom\u2019s savings.\nSo they got the only job they could, and it took us months to find it.\nThey would come home crying.\nEddy\u2019s bosses didn\u2019t want them working with anyone else because of health code violations and safety regulations. Really, they didn\u2019t want any of the bigwigs to see them, the big ugly bug monster. Those bastards put them in a warehouse, cold in the winter and hot in the summer, and made them work and work. They were an assembly line all by themself. They did more work than anybody and got treated like vermin. And we had to fight to let Eddy keep the job, even though they didn\u2019t really want it and only needed it. The bosses said it was unsanitary and unsafe and they were unfit and unseemly, and we had to fight and fight for something so small and stupid and backbreaking that I wanted to scream and that was the only time I ever heard Eddy roar: all those mouths torn open with rage and pain and a sound as big as the sky. Everyone around went white as a ghost, myself included.\nBut it didn\u2019t matter. Nothing got better. Those people weren\u2019t doing us a favor like they said, those old white men with their greasy hair and greasy smiles. They were shit and they treated Eddy like vermin and so that\u2019s what they became. Eddy fell through the cracks and had to live there, in the dirt, like the bug they said they were.\n* * *\nI did some bad things. I guess maybe we all do, but at the time I wasn\u2019t thinking about that. One night I walked out under the stars and wandered down to the crick, and everything seemed hopeless, and me the worst part of it. With all that purity around me\u2014the constellations, the walnut and dogwood trees, the smell of bruised fallen leaves\u2014I was the dirt. The speck of filth, powerless and stupid and angry.\nNo one tells you that you\u2019re always growing up, even when you\u2019re in your twenties. No one tells you it\u2019s a time of wandering for those of us who don\u2019t settle down, make a home, have a baby. We tried to live the life normal people live. Eddy tried so hard, but it wasn\u2019t for them and now they were falling apart and so was I.\nWhat had happened?\nI fell into a pile of leaves near the bank and looked at the stars and realized I hadn\u2019t done that since I was a kid, maybe ten years old. Eddy would go out with half their shoes untied and shuffle through all the leaves we didn\u2019t rake up yet even though Dad told us to. Eddy made such a noise moving through the leaves and they\u2019d trip on some root they didn\u2019t see and that part of their body would fall down and they\u2019d just let it all fall into the leaves. They could make a pile of leaves just by making a circle of their body and pulling it tight, slowly, like drawing a knot together. In the middle, there\u2019d be a mountain of leaves and I\u2019d jump in. And I\u2019d sit in the leaves and take up their smell and not care that there was water soaking into my pants, a little bit of rain not soaked up by the earth or dried by the sun because it was hidden in the leaves. And was that a whiff of pumpkin rind and pumpkin guts? Mom would be carving a big king pumpkin and Eddy\u2019d be carving too, a few at once, and they\u2019d all come out the same, but slightly different: a woodpecker pecking and then moving from one pumpkin to another like a flipbook, flying away. They loved woodpeckers and birds of all kinds, maybe because flying is the one thing they would never ever do. I like to remember Eddy that way: coming into the house when the sun started to go down, dusty orange leaves stuck to their trailing shoelaces and Mom yelling about the mess.\nThat night when I got back to the house I wandered in and sort of stood there for a while, not saying anything. Then I went up to my room, the bedroom I\u2019d had since I was a baby, and cried. I cried so hard Eddy heard and came and gave me one of their big hugs. They wrapped me up in their flesh, and yeah, I felt better, but not really because I could smell whiskey on their breath and see how long and sad their eyes had become.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d they asked.\nI didn\u2019t have any words for it then. But now I can say that I felt something break inside me and I wanted to hide. I wanted to hide myself. I wanted to crawl into myself, hide in flesh, back in a womb. What had happened to that feeling of being so alive? Someone once told me that being a kid is all about being aware of the unknown. And that when we grow up and see how everything works and how a lot of it is broken and shitty, the thing that makes us a child disappears. That the creeping feeling you get as a child, that there\u2019s something knowing and invisible watching you when you wander back to the crick and watch the sun glint on the minnows\u2019 backs, is mystery. The great unknown.\nAnd it was gone, gone for me and gone for Eddy, who never watched the birds anymore.\n* * *\nBut, like it always is, the morning after I felt silly for all the sobbing and had a nice breakfast and wandered outside and played with the roosters we kept around. We had two, and they strutted around crowing and looking pretty. Their feathers were the boldest orange I\u2019d ever seen. They reminded me of those boys you see at the bar, the ones who know they\u2019re young and shiny and beautiful and won\u2019t let you forget that they know it. They\u2019ll kick you if you don\u2019t pay them enough attention. They made me laugh, how silly they were.\nI spent that day working around the yard, trying to keep myself busy so I wouldn\u2019t go back to the dark crick and the reflections in my head. It worked, and by suppertime I was tired and hungry and my mind was clear. I went inside and Mom was cooking. She could still do that, thank God. I can\u2019t even make mashed potatoes right.\n\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you like rosemary,\u201d she said and beat a tube of croissant dough on the edge of the counter.\n\u201cSure. Hey, where\u2019s Eddy?\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d She always yelped when the tube finally broke open with a pop. \u201cI dunno. I haven\u2019t seen them.\u201d\nThere was a roar then, distant but enormous. The start of some great engine. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nShe shaped the dough into crescents on a baking sheet. \u201cHm? Must be taking down the corn finally. They\u2019re late this year.\u201d She looked out the window, ball of dough sliding from her hand, caught in a memory.\n\u201cWait. Mom. The maze?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d and I took off.\nI cut my ankle on something, a cinder block or fence post or bit of wire, all the shit that piles up in the backyards out here. The front of the harvester looked like a big electric shaver trimming the beard of the earth. The headlights lit up a storm of dust, and the driver couldn\u2019t see me or hear me, and he probably wouldn\u2019t have stopped anyway, so I just went off and searched and called their name over and over and over. Eddy, Eddy, Eddy. I screamed, trying to reach my voice above the roar of the engine. Eddy, please don\u2019t do this. But there was no answer except the call of a hawk far above, chased by two crows. Eddy wasn\u2019t there. I found their corn-husk and stalk house and I knew Eddy had been there by what they left inside. But they weren\u2019t there anymore. I missed them by a moment or two.\nEddy was gone.\n* * *\nI never found them. I searched the next morning in the light, as soon as the sun rose, and there was nothing. No one had seen them, and you can bet I asked everyone in the county. There was no track or trail leading away. No body. Nothing. I used to sit in the trailer we used to take Eddy around town in and jump at every chipmunk and squirrel sound. After a while, I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for anymore. You can hide so much out here, in the deep country.\nI haven\u2019t heard from Eddy, but every year I carve a woodpecker in a pumpkin and hope they\u2019ll see it aflame on the porch from wherever they\u2019re watching. Because that\u2019s what it feels like sometimes. I can feel one big row of eyes on me when I walk through the fields and the flowers that gave them their nickname, or near the pond, pushing through the cattails.\nMom\u2019s gone now. I think it got to her that she gave birth to something so strange, even if she found a way to love them. It ground her down. Maybe it was too much that she never got to hold Eddy much, that they outgrew the breadth of her arms so quickly. She might be gone and I miss her, but the house is still plenty busy. We\u2019re cleaning out the garden and getting ready for Halloween. I heard on the radio that it\u2019ll be a cold one, so we\u2019ll have to dress warm. They still don\u2019t know what they want their costume to be. Maybe a ghost, they said. A zombie, or maybe a caterpillar.\nKyle E.

His ears had not yet sealed, but this late in the season, they had folded over enough to muffle and distort the world. He couldn\u2019t pinpoint the creak and rustle of a young migirtju tree that cut through to him. Lost from its copse, no doubt, but clearly ready to drop migir before the snow fell. If he could find it, his winter store might last through the end of winter.\nThere. The rustle again. The migirtju must be lost; it had circled around north of Sovani. Well outside any copse\u2019s migration path. Sovani stepped softly and changed direction to match. The prospect of bolstering his stockpile of the tree\u2019s warming fruit made Sovani\u2019s still-burgeoning winter skin tingle.\nHis skin tingled differently as he closed. The creaking rustle transitioned into a thrumming purr. Taklit. This is what they did, after all: mimicked tree sound to lure prey. That should be rodents or procyonids, scavengers desperate for winter food and warmth and too foolish to question the arbitrary path of sounds. Today the prey was larger but no less foolish in his desperation.\nSovani ran, but during inbetween his ears were not sharp enough to catch the bounce-off from the rock, his skin still too dull to catch its vibrations until he stubbed his foot. His skin was alive enough to send the sharp bolt of pain from the gouge in his flesh as he toppled, sensitive enough that each drying blade of grass raked his back.\nSovani screamed into a world growing silent with the coming snowfall. His voice echoed back at him in the hollow of his folding ears. The clacking and snip of the taklit\u2019s mouths slipped into the reverberations. Sovani stiffened. The predator\u2019s body heat traced a line across the sensitive hairs of his winter skin. Sovani flinched, pulling himself into a ball, at the snap of another step. He tried to will his back not to sense the vibrations of the onrush of movement. He hadn\u2019t thought taklit hunted in pairs, but at least six mouths would end this nightmare faster than three.\nThe ululation of taklit call responded to a cry that was not a predator. It was one of The People, though Sovani did not recognize her voice. High and aggressive and filled with challenge, the new voice grabbed the tree-mimic\u2019s attention. Sovani let loose his knees when the click-purr was filtered enough to tell him the taklit\u2019s back was turned.\n\u201cNow you run!\u201d called the newcomer.\nSovani didn\u2019t hesitate. He pushed to his feet, ignoring the needle pricks of grass on his palms, and bolted. This time, he had the wit to focus on his winter skin despite the pain. Excluding the distraction of fall\u2019s dying sounds, Sovani could feel the shifts in the air, turn away from bark and boulder, until the bare circle of chill on his right told him there was a warren. Sovani rolled inside even as the booming roar of taklit was followed by a shriek only the voice of People could manage.\nHis skin seemed to dull, then, as his ears tried to parse the quiet after. He had wallowed in panic to save his own hide, and the brave other, whom Sovani could not name with any of his senses, had taken his place. This was his skill, to cower and sulk while the strong and the brave served the tribe. He made his life at the expense of his betters. Little doubt now why only Cetpa had wished him luck in the wander.\nThere was a dragging rustle. A click and scratch. Sovani tensed, listening for the snap of jaws again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d\nHer voice stretched taut with pain as it sliced into Sovani\u2019s ears. He pushed out into the open.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d he called, his voice answered with a sliding whisper of loose earth that helped him pinpoint the other.\n\u201cI bleed,\u201d she admitted, steps padding in his direction. \u201cBut the taklit no longer can. I expect I\u2019ve the better of that trade.\u201d\nShe was close enough now that her presence prickled the hairs of Sovani\u2019s winter skin, a patch of warmth in the growing cold. She lived by her own strength. Sovani, at least, could do something to help her keep that strength.\n\u201cI found behaab nearby,\u201d Sovani said, sweeping his hand so her skin would register the direction. \u201cTo stop the bleeding?\u201d\nShe gave a soft hum, her temperature pulsing once to signal her agreement.\nSovani did not speak until they reached the behaab, its leaves a filament of tepid tendrils against the deeper chill of the air. He worried his words might betray his weakness. He waited as the other daubed on the clotting, healing sap, until the slashes of dribbling heat from the newcomer had eased with her blood, thickened enough to stop the wound.\n\u201cI am Sovani,\u201d he said, matching the word with the pattern of tap and snap that was his skin name.\n\u201cI am Beyharide,\u201d the woman said, her own skin name wafting the hairs of Sovani\u2019s forearm.\nHe hesitated. His was a weakling\u2019s debt, best repaid with derision. But he could not deny it any more than the quiver of wind between them.\n\u201cI owe you my life,\u201d he admitted.\nThere was silence, of both voice and body, until finally Beyharide said, \u201cMaybe we could start with a bit of rest and a bite of migir.\u201d\n* * *\nSovani grew up knowing there were other tribes of People, each following the migration of separate copses\u2014some trailing his own preferred migirtju, others bound to the soft torthai or rubbery odskocit or even the spine-encrusted stachelig. The route of Beyharide\u2019s copse had brought her here a few weeks before Sovani, and like Sovani, she\u2019d reached the age for wandering.\n\u201cNot that I understand the name,\u201d Beyharide said as they sought a winter berth. \u201cI traveled much farther following migirtju than I will waiting for them to swing north again.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s relative,\u201d Sovani tried. Their ears were fast closing, so they spoke and skin-talked at the same time. Beyharide\u2019s gestures and heat fluxes were larger, sharper than Sovani\u2019s own. Everything about her impressed. Certainly the central heat she gave off put her at a much more imposing height than Sovani.\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Beyharide conceded. \u201cWe wander far from them, until we choose to return in the summer.\u201d\n\u201cIf,\u201d Sovani corrected. The hairs on his leg quivered in response to a tense vibration of Beyharide\u2019s own.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d Beyharide asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re meant to choose, yes?\u201d Sovani asked, careful to hold his back easy so the skin-talk wouldn\u2019t carry the tension he felt.\nBeyharide did not speak, though a tickle of air at his shoulder said, That\u2019s what they told me. Followed by the incredulous percussive of Beyharide\u2019s hands clapping out, Only dead leaves abandon a tree.\nSovani took the cue and dropped speech, his own ears barely a day from sealing for the season.\nAnd seeds, Sovani added with a ripple of body heat and a puff of breath.\nThis was the way, after all. People might never join another tribe, but with an unclaimed copse, they might start anew. At least, that was the story.\n* * *\nSovani had always found it cruel that touch grew keen just as the world bit at him with cold. Of course that was the point. The faint touch of the rest of the year was too dull for People to notice when cold threatened a digit or exposed patch of flesh before limbs and skin had already gone dead. Without nerves primed to sense and map the thermals in a wide radius, the threat of losing yourself in a blizzard\u2014losing the warmth of other People\u2014was too much to consider.\nSovani wasn\u2019t certain he could find sympathetic warmth even with his winter skin, mind. Cetpa, his sister, had grown tall and powerful, her worth obvious to the senses of any season, but Sovani was scrawny and timid. Sovani climbed migirtju limbs too slowly. Carried too few migir with every trip.\n\u201cI hope you grow strong in your wandering,\u201d Cetpa had said, but Sovani\u2019s ears had been full and open then, and Cetpa not skilled enough to hide the tremble threaded in her tone. Her words called for hope, her voice for despair: I fear this will kill you.\n\u201cThere is always strength in the wandering,\u201d Sovani had returned, pitching his voice farther to the bass, bolstering his tone with confidence. If I die it is the will of the world.\n\u201cClaim it as your birthright,\u201d Cetpa had said. Sovani\u2019s ears caught the slight trill on the last syllable: I will mourn you as none before or since.\nShe had hefted the sack of migir to him. It was lighter than what he would need, but any heavier and he\u2019d never have been able to carry it.\nBeyharide, however, had strength to carry more than she might need. Sovani wove a story of losing half his store to an earlier taklit attack. Sweeping the air with a vicious battle he never fought covered the weakness in both his back and his heart. There was no twitch of doubt from Beyharide, at least. His contribution to their store was smaller, but enough that they knew the winter would not claim their lives from empty, frozen stomachs.\nIs it against the spirit of wandering to spend the winter together? Sovani wondered in a series of twitches and a wave of cold across the surface of his skin. After three days, they had found but a single cave they might bolster against the cold. Sovani had moved to cede it to Beyharide, but she would have none of it.\nIf we never tell them, does it matter? Beyharide replied, her fingers spread wide to trace lukewarm patterns in the air between them. Sovani was grateful to let the matter fall to the side.\nThey felt the blizzard slithering its way south with enough time to build a door to Beyharide\u2019s cave. It was hard work for Sovani\u2019s lighter frame, but he pushed himself. Turned his mind away from the heavy crush of rock on flesh. Even greeted the rake against his skin when he found bark that must have been shed before the migirtju left.\nThe shiver of Beyharide along his back said, We should lie close tonight.\nHe did not respond.\nFor the warmth, she added.\nThat close, though, and his small, insignificant frame would be clear. She would know he could never have carried the migir he claimed, that the second taklit was a mirage woven with over-warm hands. He had been clever to wrap the migirtju bark across the windbreak to better hold the cave\u2019s heat, but clever would not help if she knew how little he could provide.\nHe swished the air, radiating a thermal hum and blowing in the direction of the fruit: The migir sheds more heat than either of us. Place it between.\nThere came a confused brush of Beyharide\u2019s palms sliding across her forearms, which tickled Sovani\u2019s.\nWe can protect it better like that, he added with the tattoo of snapping fingers.\nBeyharide conceded the point with a thrum of heat at her palm.\nSovani slept easier, the warmth of unsplit migir piled between the two of them. Though easier was by no means easy.\n* * *\nBeyharide still outlifted him, but Sovani found himself more and more capable of labor as the winter passed. Whether he was growing stronger or piling up vengeance his body would one day exact upon itself he wasn\u2019t sure. Either way, as the migir dwindled and the wind and cold on his flesh waned, Sovani\u2019s fears that Beyharide might abandon him as a parasite diminished.\nStill, he kept what migir that remained between them at night, though it was no longer warmer than the body of another. Beyharide\u2019s heat wavered above the fruit\u2019s outer edges. He hoped his own fainter aura did not raise suspicions in her.\nThe ground softened, and the rich smell of snowmelt and mud cut through the slits of Sovani\u2019s just-opening nostrils.\nThe work of pulling down the windbreak from the cave entrance was not so painful as building it. Spring encouraged Sovani\u2019s winter skin to fade and dull even as his nostrils widened.\nWe let the husks sit too long, came Beyharide\u2019s sharp mix of pherospeak. Sovani returned a whiff of agreement to cut through the pungent aroma of rotting migir husks. As soon as they had worked the wind break open, they set to removing the waste from the winter\u2019s fruit.\nThe air of decay abandoned to a western breeze, Sovani caught a familiar, subtle mix of powdery spice.\nKhaipaus. He signaled Beyharide by emulating the aroma.\nA desperate glee filled his nostrils in response. Khaipaus traveled much farther afield than most copses, its migration pattern capricious and its bunches ephemeral. No People could sustain themselves by following it, but all of them found the trickle of its juice worth the chasing when the opportunity presented itself.\nHe led them both through the swirls of tart and wafts of pollen, navigated the lingering must of humidity. Sovani tensed a moment at a whiff of taklit, but it was far away and its vocal skills of no use in spring. They veered away from the danger and swung back around until khaipaus overtook the air.\nBefore they could breathe deep enough to count them, the powdery swath of khaipaus scattered.\nQuick, Sovani puffed out. Flatten your scent. Go right. I\u2019ll go left.\nIt was a skill Sovani found especially helpful back with the tribe. Masking his scent in the spring reduced his profile, offered no threat or challenge to his peers. With Sovani hidden in the wash of their stronger scents, they were content to let him linger close, where he gathered the migir they discarded as beneath their notice.\nSovani slunk with practiced skill through the muck that tickled his nose, breathing deep enough to pinpoint a pair of khaipaus where they cowered under the acrid cloud given off by a lohtka\u2019s wide leaves.\nSovani slowed, focused on his glands, smoothing his own telltales as he slinked forward. He grabbed a rock, rubbing his oils on it, and threw it away from himself. Its stronger smell drew the khaipaus\u2019s attention. They bolted, but straight to Sovani, who managed to snatch one in each hand.\nBeyharide hadn\u2019t been as good at masking herself. Sovani could smell her from here. He pressed his musk out to catch Beyharide\u2019s nose: I have them. Come quick.\nBeyharide reeked of a breathless exhaustion as she arrived, though the redolence of excitement soon overtook the former smell.\nPick, Sovani wafted. And she did, stripping the khaipaus of their meaty berries.\nWhen Sovani caught the whiff of Beyharide\u2019s Done, he let the small plants go, to trace a line of spice in their retreat.\nThe berries were the perfect balm to wash down the dullness of overripe migir.\nBeyharide couldn\u2019t hide the admiration that creeped from her pores as she asked, How do you do that?\nPractice? Sovani returned with a faint earthy perfume.\nA heady mix of excitement filled his nose as Beyharide closed on him, an undercurrent of piquant amusement as she asked, What would it take for you to teach me?\nHe threw her a quick tang that spoke of nonchalance he didn\u2019t feel: I\u2019ll share what I know and what I catch, of course. No cost.\nA thread of sour indicated some kind of disappointment from Beyharide, but Sovani hoped he might erase it if he could teach something new to her.\nIt was contrary to Beyharide\u2019s inclinations to suppress her natural musk, but eventually she had the basics. The spring passed in a friendly competition, with Beyharide\u2019s gains in stealth matched by Sovani\u2019s gains in endurance, until near the apex of the season they felt truly matched.\nSo much so that one afternoon, as they lingered under the bouquet of an odskocit grown elderly enough to root, Sovani toyed with the notion that perhaps the two of them, far from the press of tribe, could make a life in this, together.\nToo late he caught the whiff of the idea seep from his skin. Beyharide\u2019s own aroma filled with tension.\nAn idle notion, Sovani assured her with a calming essence.\nOf course, Beyharide returned, her musk falling back to calm.\nThe next morning, Beyharide was gone.\n* * *\nHe should have remembered the fear that shivered across Beyharide\u2019s skin as winter fell and he suggested the wandering could end without a return. She was what the tribes valued. Of course she would want to rejoin them.\nShe had also learned Sovani\u2019s lessons, for he could smell no trace of her to follow, only the swirls of dew and pollen.\nHe no longer dreaded his chances at survival, at least. The winter\u2019s labor and the spring\u2019s hunts, and perhaps a natural growth that was late to find him, left him wider in the shoulder, stronger in the legs and arms, than he had been when winter fell.\nIt took more work to strip the thinning khaipaus of their berries, but he managed. He needed less of them on his own, anyway. He supplemented with rooted plants as he could, when the heady aroma of their flowers dropped away, replaced by the subtler incense of their fruits.\nThat change was signal, too, of the coming summer. Sovani built what stores he could before his nostrils began to thin and close. The dark world grew gray as the thick film that protected his eyes from fall\u2019s debris and winter\u2019s wind and spring\u2019s pollen thinned.\nSpotted patches of color came next. Pops of red, smudges of pale yellow, all of it backed by variegated green. Sovani drew in deep breaths through the slits of his nose, trying to hold the scents and the colors together during inbetween. He knew the world balked at such combinations, but the pairing of khaipaus and violet, earthiness and brown, these brought the inbetween alive until his eyes were clear of all obstruction and the world came into focus.\nIt was in these final moments that he caught the bold musk he thought forever gone. Beyharide.\nThe flesh of his nose already threatened to close for the year. He pressed his fingers up, trying to pry one more moment. Enough to give him a direction: there.\nSovani ran, through the blurs of green leaves and over the speckled gray of stone, after the fleeting glimpses of black and reddish brown that streaked ahead. Beyharide was stronger and faster than him. He would never catch her, could never draw her attention. He ran all the same.\nHe called out Beyharide\u2019s name as he bolted up the incline, past blots of indigo on vines of zureklop, though neither of them could hear it. Swept and clapped her skin name when he pressed between the umber trunks of a pair of dying stachelig, though both their flesh was now too dull to feel it.\nGreens and oranges mingled and melted into the clear blue and yellow of the sky at the hill\u2019s peak, Sovani trying to will his pores to waft the pungent cologne of Beyharide\u2019s pheroname, but if he couldn\u2019t smell it, breathing hard from the sprint uphill, he knew he would not catch her attention with it.\nHe broke through the last of the cover to the empty, high crest of the hill, and the movement stopped. Beyharide stood waiting.\nHer meaty hands rested on her hips, thick legs set wide for support. Her breasts hung flat against her broad torso. In the bright sunlight, Sovani\u2019s eyes found their final summer focus, rising along the lines of Beyharide\u2019s dark form. Sovani took in the fine, black hairs along her forearms and over her lip. The latter were surely the way she had felt the taklit so keenly during inbetween to dodge it. Or, dodge it well enough to keep both eyes: bite scars arced along the left side of her face, ending at a slight droop to that side of her mouth.\nYou are the most beautiful creature any season knows, Sovani signed.\nI\u2019m sorry I left, she signed. Sovani regretted that the muscle he had added came without the fat that spoke of success and surplus.\nThe droop at one side of Beyharide\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t stop her smile. She waved him over, pointing to the valley.\nSovani joined her on the scatter of tiny yellow flowers, followed the line of her finger into the distance. Two copses of migirtju passed near each other on their way back to their summer homes. Tall, wide trunks swayed from side to side. Branches waved with the motion of rootstep. Oversized droplets of leaves quivered in the wind. Sovani recognized his own copse, felt his stomach drop as he realized the other would be Beyharide\u2019s. The end of wandering approached on slithering wooden roots.\nI made assumptions, pressures that someone like you never needs to entertain, he signed.\nBeyharide furrowed her bushy brows again, then shook her head.\nLook again, she signed. Her hand cradled the back of his head, brought his eyes to a lower angle. He was glad it was not fall, when she would have heard his small gasp.\nMeandering through the space between the two larger copses was a grouping of younger migirtju trees. Their bark was pale, their leaves specks, but it was clear they had gathered together and moved in a path that did not follow either of the larger copses.\nSovani squinted, pushing his newly settled sight. He could pick out the spots of moving shadow in the branches of the larger copses, but the new copse was empty.\nUnclaimed, Beyharide signed. You found the cave, the bark for the windbreak. Stacked the migir to warm our winter. Traced and tricked the khaipaus. You are clever. It was my turn. I knew if we were to be together, I had to find us our own\u2014\nTogether? Sovani signed, matching the sweep of his paired hands with the one she had made.\nShe smiled again, leaning close. Sovani returned the smile at the flash of light in her eyes, and kissed her.\nBeyharide tasted sweet as the trill of birdsong with the earthy heat of unsplit migir, the tang of khaipaus bouquet wrapped in the prismatic spray of a summer storm.\nJason Kimble left the tornadoes of Michigan for the hurricanes of Florida, because spinning air is better when it\u2019s warm.

{"fingerprint":"nluRS6JtoU1JUIlCatFyLr0zJ5w","title":"The Last Work of Jan Rosthoven","author":"Matthew A. Timmins","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"As Zeus birthed Athena, so Jan Rosthoven produced his fiction: alone and silent, after much pain, he would split his head and forth with a cry would leap a novel fully formed and, but for his name on the title page, seemingly ex nihilo. If it were not so, his last novel would still sit upon the heavy shelves of Soph, Lord of Doors and of the Known. But alas, Rosthoven\u2019s final work died with him. The fire that consumed the house consumed the author, consumed the manuscript.\nSo it is that Soph, Lord of Doors and of the Known, takes down from its place Rosthoven\u2019s last novel and, looking fondly through the pages for the final time, prepares to take it away.\nSoph is the Lord of Doors and the Lord also of the Known. The face of Soph is known to you. It is the face you know best; it is the face of your mother, your child, your lover, or your tormentor. We all know the face of Soph. The house of Soph, too, is known to you. It is the house of your heart, your childhood home, your dream-castle, or your prison. Though there are more doors than you remember.\nDoors of every description. Doors of men and doors of women, doors of beasts and doors of machines. It is to one of these doors that Soph now comes. It is a solemn door, a low door; its lintel is fashioned of phosphorescent metal, its sill of antediluvian wood, its jambs of monstrous bone, its panels of the hardest blackness, its hinges of a mysterious construction. It has no lock or handle but stands always ajar, at the bottom of a staircase, at the end of a hall, behind a wall, known only to Soph. Soph is the Lord of Doors and loves all doors save this one. Soph is the Lord of the Known and fears not any knowledge, save this door. It is to this door that Soph brings the last book of Jan Rosthoven.\nThis door\u2014that the Lord of All Doors fears\u2014leads to the Space Between, that no-place that lies betwixt knowing and forgetting, possession and loss. Many times the Lord of Doors and of the Known has trod this way, but each journey is the first. How long this journey is, or how much time passes, Soph cannot say. And if Soph cannot say, who can say? For how much space lies between knowing a thing and forgetting a thing, or when lies the moment when memory fails?\nAnd so by strange and secret way comes Soph to a wide and welcoming portal and, passing beneath it, the Place of Forgetting. Here Soph is greeted by a bewildered amnesiac. She casts about her for something and, not finding it, says, \u201cWelcome . . . to . . . this place.\u201d\nSoph looks at her with pity and says, \u201cOnce we were known to one another . . . Helena Bethany Cook . . . before you came to serve the Lord of the Forgotten. But now, good and faithful servant, you must take me to your master.\u201d\nThe servant smiles at the gift of her name, but immediately it slips from her like quicksilver and, not remembering why she smiles, she frowns. \u201cThis way.\u201d Hesitating between two halls, she chooses at random and moves slowly away. Soph follows.\nThe Place of Forgetting, wherein dwells the Lord of the Forgotten, is vast. This much reason tells us, for it holds many things. It has depth and dimension, it is no nebulous void or ethereal realm: it is a place of sound and color, though no odor is to be detected. As you have visited the House of Soph, so you have been to the Place of Forgetting. Not hidden from you are its wonders, but upon your departure they remain in the Place of Forgetting and you take not any away, nor even all that you had brought.\nThe erstwhile Helena Bethany Cook and the eternal Lord of the Known pass through this house of loss and come finally to the Unremembered Library. Here Soph is sad to see many things that had once resided in the House of Soph: the volumes of Alexandria and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, the bottled dreams of a hundred million nights, and, alas, more loves than hates. There is prepared for Soph an old man\u2019s chair draped in the flag of a forgotten principality; beside this, on a table thick with the portraits of the unrecognized, rests a plate of manna and a bottle of Carthaginian wine.\nAnd standing before a vault of mercifully stolen pains is the Lord of the Forgotten.\n\u201cMaster?\u201d says the servant. Then noticing Soph as if for the first time, she adds, \u201cMaster . . . a guest?\u201d\nThe Lord of the Forgotten bows to Soph and welcomes the Lord of Doors and of the Known.\nSoph bows as well. \u201cGreetings, most gracious Lord of the Forgotten. I trust you are well?\u201d\nThe Lord of the Forgotten speaks.\n\u201cYes,\u201d chuckles Soph. \u201cIt is always so.\u201d\nAgain, the Lord of the Forgotten speaks.\n\u201cI have come to lend you this,\u201d says the Lord of the Known, offering up the last work of Jan Rosthoven. \u201cAnnals of Vainglory is its title. It is a defiant novel, full of lies and passion, poetry and defeat, baseless hope and rain.\u201d Wistful is the voice of Soph. \u201cHad Fate played differently it would have coiled like a viper in the tall grass. It would have spread among the quiet searchers like a shameful disease and founded the cult of Jan Rosthoven. I think you will enjoy it.\u201d\nThe Lord of the Forgotten takes the book from Soph\u2019s hand, and speaks.\nSoph\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cPerhaps. Perhaps not.\u201d\nThe servant, forgotten, wanders from the room.\nTurning, the Lord of the Forgotten walks to a shelf crowded with abandoned works and unread literature and dead secrets, and slips the Annals of Vainglory into its place, between De Tribus Impostoribus and a translation of Xu Bing\u2019s A Book from the Sky. Turning back to Soph, the Lord of the Forgotten speaks at greater length.\nAnd anger grows on the countenance of Soph. \u201cI come, O Lord of Things Lost and Neglected, out of respect. I come, O Thief of Yesterday, because there need be no enmity between us. As it is with the Lord of the Born and the Lord of the Ended, so it is with us.\u201d\nSpeaks the Lord of the Forgotten.\n\u201cIt is to be war among us, then?\u201d\nSpeaks again the Lord of the Forgotten.\n\u201cYou are too proud, my Lord. Have you forgotten that I have taken things from this place as well? Ubar is known again and Helike is found. Yun Sook Min is restored to her family and the \u2018Battle of Anghiari\u2019 will soon be mine once more. My servants are legion and their power waxes. The Unremembered Library is vast, it is true, but the Library of Soph is ever-increasing and its doors are fast barred. Fewer and fewer are the losses to your spies; anon it will be unassailable, and then it shall be you who will crawl to me to deliver up your treasures!\u201d\nSoftly, the Lord of the Forgotten speaks.\n\u201cThink you so,\u201d scoffs Soph. \u201cYou know only those things that are old, dead, things that were. I know things that are alive, things that are. You sit here blind\u2014blind!\u2014till I bring you my refuse! But I! I can glimpse things that will be. Dimly I perceive wonders which you cannot fathom. It may be that you trust too much in the End. It may be the End will never come.\u201d\nThe Lord of the Forgotten speaks again.\nSoph stands, sets down a wine glass. \u201cAnd if it is so? If there are none left to know, can there be any left to forget? At the End, who will forget, my Lord, who will forget?\u201d With a cold nod Soph, the Lord of Doors and of the Known, departs.\nAlone, the Lord of the Forgotten smiles.\nOr perhaps not.

{"fingerprint":"uoq-7vsxyhc+4ur5gPorwy8LFK0","title":"The Stone Horse of Flores","author":"Michael J. DeLuca","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"The caballero came into Flores along the lakeshore from the north, riding a magnificent horse and leading two others laden behind him. The sun, glinting from a silver helmet slung on the pommel of a spare saddle, projected images in air: spectral men in frayed white robes strolled ahead of him along the path and out across the lake.\nHe met some of the women of Flores returning from market with baskets on their heads, children and half-wild dogs at their heels (Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, to save her joints, had not gone with them; later she would regret this). The dogs fled into the jungle, barking. The children ran among the spectral men, vying to catch their attention, splashing in the warm shallows where the lake had risen across the path, only for the floating figures to disappear as the caballero led the horses into the furred shade of a cigarette tree.\nHe asked the women where was the safest place on the lake to bathe, where he could find cooked food, clean water, and a dry place away from the insects to sleep, but they couldn\u2019t understand his speech. Yulia sent Paquito, a skinny boy with turkey-legs, running ahead to find Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda.\nShe was at the fountain, washing clothes in boiled water. By the time Paquito reached her, he had already told his news to enough of the others that the whole of Flores laid aside work and came to witness the caballero\u2019s arrival. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda frowned at this; it was close enough to rest time that she supposed it didn\u2019t matter, but she kept on in her own rhythm, scrubbing, wringing out and hanging, telling Paco and his crowd to bring the caballero to her.\nThe caballero was youthful of face but gaunt, impossibly tall even after he had stepped from the saddle. The horses\u2019 eyes were waxen and bright like ripe chiles, and a spike-headed commbird rode among the jumble of baggage, squawking out bursts of disjointed information in a rapid series of encodings, some of which Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda remembered enough to catch and which made her shudder.\nHe repeated his predictable requests.\nOut of courtesy, but with a look of reproach for the villagers, she laid aside her work. \u201cNo part of the lake is safe,\u201d she told him, using the tongue of the conquerors as she had learned it as a child\u2014filled with archaisms, as she surmised from his expression. \u201cYour horses may bathe in it, but take care not to let their lips break the surface. The current is fastest at the mouth of the aqueduct on the west shore outside of town; there you may best avoid the parasites and aberrations. The land around Flores is tainted. The fish are bad. You may have noticed how many of our children are deformed.\u201d She didn\u2019t see it necessary to mention that the older people had been crippled and scarred by other side effects of conquest\u2014nor to call attention to her own toeless foot. \u201cThe only clean water is kept in a cistern underground. We filter it daily from the fountain for drinking\u2014but if anyone were to wash in it, others must suffer from thirst. The people will share the best of their hospitality\u2014we have a garden grown with fresh earth carried down from the volcano from which the food is safe to eat\u2014but you must forgive our limitations. A place away from bugs we can provide\u2014but dry? Not in this season.\u201d\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda\u2019s wash fluttered, strung from the awning of the fountain to the thatched eaves of her hut. The folk of Flores crowded; the hot-eyed horses flipped their tails at flies and suffered themselves stonily to be touched.\nThe helmet flared at a sunbeam breaking between Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda\u2019s wash, and the insubstantial robed men spread fishing nets across the mud-caked cobblestones; their catch was first famine, then feast.\n\u201cI must be clean,\u201d said the caballero. \u201cMy horses must be clean. Will you gather wood for a fire, heat lake water to boiling, find soap? Will you share food with me from your clean gardens? Will you kill of your turkeys for me? Great toil lies ahead of me. I mean to make this part of the forest livable again.\u201d\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda felt pity more than awe for this latecomer demigod. The old gods could have . . . but they were gone.\nShe alone among the town recalled the strife that had led them to these straits. This man\u2019s arrival, carrying, disguised, the trappings of their fall, could only make things worse. But she knew her people well enough to recognize she could never convince them. They had lost the capacity to fall back upon the literal except under duress. She\u2019d encouraged it.\nIt would have been so much easier just to forget.\nThe folk of Flores, overcome at the promise and magic of him, did as the caballero asked without question, expending energy gained from clean food they couldn\u2019t grow again for a season, letting their own tasks, the work of survival, go undone. They brought forth their cooking pots and filled them from the lake. They fetched cigarette, ceiba, chocolate, and cloud maple wood from the forest to feed the coughing flames. They scrubbed man and horses with coarse palm brushes, and the brown soap bubbles and mingled blood of slaughtered turkeys rolled down over the muddied cobbles into the lake. Under the caballero\u2019s close direction and Mar\u00eda\u2019s, they scoured the pieces of his armor and what tools he\u2019d permit them to touch. He himself cleaned the terrible, night-colored gun, too gigantic and worn for his slightness or his youth. \u201cScrub hard,\u201d he told them through Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda. \u201cInfection at times is invisible.\u201d\nIt was Paco\u2019s small sister, Cresencia, on hands and knee with her head to the ground, who discovered that the horses\u2019 hooves did not quite touch the earth. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda saw no reason to translate the caballero\u2019s hasty, jingoistic explanation. The miracles of the new gods Flores could do without and would only bring him to ill end. The proof of it was everywhere.\nLater, when the caballero caught Cresencia trying on the shining helmet, passing her fingers through the gleam to see the robed men jump and flicker, he said, \u201cLet her keep it. I\u2019ve a better.\u201d The bird crackled, its spiked plumes fluctuating with the signal, and Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda wished the caballero gone.\nWhen all that could meet his satisfaction had been seen to (he had turned down the best hammocks they could show him, claiming he preferred no rest at all to the diminished sort he might achieve in limited accommodations), when he had feasted, complimented Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda\u2019s cooking (though she hadn\u2019t put a hand to spoon), girded his loins and reassembled his steely invulnerability about his chest, he gathered Flores to him once again.\n\u201cOne of my horses, Rosinand, is damaged. He has grown too weak to follow me on the trails I must travel. Will you care for him until I return?\u201d\nThe pueblo cheered. They\u2019d never seen a horse, much less a thing like red-eyed Rosinand. They saw this as a gift\u2014a reward. They thought he could wash the hills clean.\nHis provisions loaded onto one spare horse instead of two, the caballero followed the aqueduct west into the tainted forest, never to be seen again.\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda debated whether to scold her people, to threaten what this horse might do to Flores if its sickness were to spread\u2014what the caballero\u2019s well-intentioned efforts would undoubtedly do in the forested hills surrounding the lake and their village. But what could the pueblo be made to suffer that they hadn\u2019t suffered before? The children fawned over Rosinand; the adults grew quiet, even reverent, in the horse\u2019s presence. And the way Cresencia wore that helmet prancing in the sunlight. . . . It made them happy. The oldest gods knew they deserved that.\nCreature of flesh and blood though he was not, Rosinand, whether truly sick or simply depleted from journeying, remained docile despite the attention. Paco and his friends goaded each other into climbing astride him until it became clear he would present no challenge; when Ad\u00e1n, the oldest man in the village\u2014barely half Mar\u00eda\u2019s age, if she counted right\u2014warned them to stop lest they wear the poor beast to exhaustion, it seemed the first it had occurred to anyone that Rosinand was not divine.\nThey let Rosinand rest in the turkey yard under the shade of the chocolate tree, where the only sweet grass in the village grew; Paquito brought him a pot of clean water. But the horse wouldn\u2019t touch the grass, and he wouldn\u2019t drink.\nThe children, debating this, came to Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda. \u201cWhat do horses eat, great-grandmother\u2014not people food, surely?\u201d The peaceful giants cast by Cresencia\u2019s warlike helmet glided among them, appearing, though silently, to join in the debate. The broken horse\u2019s chile-eyes, their shapes flickering from spheres through a variety of myriad-sided polyhedra, studied Mar\u00eda balefully through the sparkling threads the girls had braided in his mane.\nShe didn\u2019t know. If she had, she wouldn\u2019t have told them.\nThe next day her porridge was thinner than usual, noticeably lacking in breadnuts and dried fruit. As she\u2019d expected, her people had given the best they had to the caballero.\nAfter the night\u2019s fog dissipated, but before the daily deluge of midmorning, a swath of barren, fire-blackened earth could be seen on a hillside to the west where yesterday the tainted cloud forest had thrived, as though the volcano had fired its nevermore through the sky like a cannon. Paco and a few other boys wanted to investigate this phenomenon; Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda forbade it. It was just as possible they would arrive and find the forest intact, as though nothing had happened, as that the scorched ground would splash up like hard rain from a puddle and char the boys\u2019 flesh from their shins. She consoled them that instead, so long as they obeyed their elders, they could run with the grown men of Flores up the flanks of the volcano to help fetch new earth from the ashfield\u2019s edge.\nThe boys accepted this, to her relief. Having learned of the existence of horsemen and horses, and that their great-grandmother had known this but never revealed it, somehow they still trusted her\u2014though not enough to save any fruit for her breakfast. She burned a piece of incense at the shattered altar in the swamp and gave thanks for the small things.\nBy midday, the rain passed, making way for sweltering humidity; the scorched patch moved uphill, leaving its previous location occupied by a rippling green blanket of maize. This elicited significant excitement, particularly when a few claimed to have seen, for a brief period during the heaviest downpour, a lake, sparkling blue against the muddied-cotton sky. \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda warned Paquito for the second time, \u201cor you\u2019ll find\u2014like the wild dog who barked at his reflection in the lake and discovered it had stolen his bone\u2014that more has been taken from you than what you hoped to gain.\u201d\nIn the afternoon, she held school in the plaza, trying to teach sums to those who would listen. Cresencia sweated beneath her helmet, the embroidered billows of her handed-down dress nearly concealing the misshapen crook of her shoulder, her beautiful face screwed up in thought, until she was struck by an epiphany: \u201cHis feet don\u2019t touch the ground\u2014not even the clean ground. He won\u2019t eat grass or ground maize or even tortilla. He needs to be washed in hot, boiled water, but he won\u2019t drink hot chocolate, coffee, or even sweet milk.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does all this lead you to conclude?\u201d snapped Mar\u00eda, interrupted in the act of demonstrating twenty twenties on her knuckles.\n\u201cI believe\u201d\u2014Cresencia said this quietly, with excessive expenditure of breath\u2014\u201cI believe Rosinand is a creature of the sky.\u201d\nMagical thinking, thought Mar\u00eda with regret. No sums would Flores learn today.\nThe afternoon rest was interrupted again, this time with running about in search of anything that might share Rosinand\u2019s affinity with air and fire. Bromeliad flowers, plucked at great risk from the treetops. Fork-tongued orchids from the swamp. A comb of honey. A cup of the fiery spirit Ad\u00e1n and his brother distilled from anything and everything the village could spare.\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, the horse suffered itself to be fed.\nOnly when Rosinand opened his lips to accept that first bromeliad blossom did it become clear he was truly sick. Beyond the sharp and broken teeth, a landscape opened out of him, red, smoke shrouded, shot with stars, more vast than the insides of even so mythical a beast should be. The angular planes of it bisected the bodies of the people who crowded around him, the slender trunk and plump yellow fruit of the chocolate tree that shaded them, the moisture-dark posts of the garden fence. For a moment, Mar\u00eda found herself encased within the surface of another world\u2014a clumsily rendered, definitionless world of shearing fault lines, jagged peaks, and gaping fissures. Then Rosinand closed his mouth to chew.\n\u201cI saw through him,\u201d breathed Cresencia, who\u2019d been feeding him and had the best view. \u201cI saw Flores through his belly! It was changed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t stay in the garden anymore,\u201d said Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda. \u201cWe should never have allowed him into Flores.\u201d\nShe personally banished the ugly, dangerous, broken machine masquerading as a living being from the village, hobbling ahead of the horse with one finger through each of his nostrils, leaning her weight on him for balance whenever she took a step with her toeless foot. With a length of rope sawed from her clothes-drying lines, she tied him to the cigarette tree where the swollen lake spilled over the market path.\nAs she sloshed back to solid ground, stooping with one arm extended to keep from toppling into the contaminated flood, she squinted into the haze over the forest, if only to avoid being obliged to acknowledge the quarter-inch of air between the water\u2019s surface and Rosinand\u2019s hooves. The burned-black desert of the scorch had moved again; it had expanded to cover an entire hillside, cut with gouges that laid bare the earth\u2019s limestone bones. In its former location, there now appeared a glowing villa with orange terracotta roofing tiles and a lawn strewn with spike-headed topiary.\nShe forbade anyone in Flores from visiting the horse or feeding it.\nTheir precious patch of clean garden displayed no sign of having begun to resemble the angular doomscape of the horse\u2019s gullet: the cloying scents of mango and bougainvillea susurrated among waxen leaves; the avocados\u2019 flesh was buttery and chartreuse; the bees pursued nectar with a single-mindedness only the daily threat of deluge could provoke. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda said a prayer, burned sage outside the garden gate, and anointed with oils the roots of the chocolate tree. She congratulated herself on having caught the threat in time and saved her village from starvation, despite the fact that the people of Flores now looked the other way when she passed.\nShe could permit them not to love her, so long as they did as she asked.\nThe caballero\u2019s spike-headed bird flew across the lake at suppertime, disappearing into an oily hole in the sky that healed before Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda could begin to dread. It had left this world for another, which she interpreted to mean the caballero\u2019s death. At least it had left no gap behind.\nShe breakfasted on hot milk with flaked maize and sweet rice.\nThe gatherers of virgin dirt from the volcano sent word that the flow of water from the aqueduct had turned from clouded yellow-brown to black. She brushed this off as no great loss\u2014the condition of the lake could hardly get worse.\nDuring the downpour of midmorning, Yulia came to Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda soaking and distraught, begging her to do something. Cresencia and Paco had gone to see the horse at sunrise\u2014though she hastened to point out that they had obeyed Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda\u2019s wish by not venturing near it\u2014and Cresencia was inconsolable with fear that Rosinand would waste away.\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda asked for time to think.\nAd\u00e1n arrived as the rain slackened, wearing a giant palm frond like an ancestor\u2019s plume to fend off the heaviest drops. He poured two tiny cups of his homemade spirit from a bat-headed jug, and they sipped, contesting to retain the stoniest expression. \u201cLet them care for the beast,\u201d he advised. \u201cThey believe it a god. Even if you know otherwise. . . .\u201d He waited. She cupped the drink before pursed lips and offered nothing.\n\u201cIf the caballero returns and finds we neglected his charge\u2014or even in the event of some unrelated catastrophe\u2014if it dies, and there are consequences, they may blame you. No other in Flores has the wisdom to take up your mantle.\u201d\nThe volcano barked in the distance, its vocalizations causing tremors in her bowels.\nWhen the sun boiled through the clouds, the chocolate tree in the garden where Rosinand had been tethered sprouted faceless black jewels. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda ordered it cut down and burned. Certain cobbles in the plaza, where the infected horse\u2019s weightless hooves had passed, projected spikes into the air that when touched proved immaterial. The earth-carriers returned from the volcano with the news that Paco and two other boys had ventured into the tainted forest and never returned. They were last seen heading for the villa, which overnight had sprouted a field of solar cells, a skewed antenna tower, and a maze of dark cracks snaking up from its foundation.\nCresencia, when she heard what had happened, only wailed harder. Huge, clean tears rolled down her cheeks, mingling with the sweat from beneath the caballero\u2019s helmet in the rain-damp cloth of her handed-down dress. The spectral men seated themselves on absent benches; dwarfing her tiny, misshapen, shaking form, their faces radiant, they feasted on fish, wine, and bread.\nMar\u00eda instructed the earth-carriers to begin a new garden on the far side of town from the first; the old one, she told them, had been tainted with Rosinand\u2019s contagion. Then, leaving behind the support of Ad\u00e1n\u2019s still-firm shoulder, she retreated to the altar in the swamp to cry.\nShe had brought neither incense nor anointing oils, and she couldn\u2019t find the words to pray. The old gods were gone, killed by the new gods. Her prayers to them had always been more a matter of comfort than hope. The new gods\u2014the gods of the commbird, the submachine gun, and the magic horse\u2014they still had power, but listened only to those like the caballero and brought only suffering. As for the oldest gods\u2014they were chaos, the wind, and the rain, too vast and ancient to attend the cares of any mortal being\u2014the oldest gods required sacrifice more potent than incense and prayer.\nHer wisdom, her memory of eighty years of change, had failed Flores. It had failed before, but this time it would starve and kill them, force them to eat again of tainted fruit, deform their children. They would no longer listen when she spoke.\nAfter eighty years\u2014if she counted right\u2014it was easy to forget that change never ceased. Nearing the end of so long a race, it was easy to rely on what had worked so many times before. But her wisdom, her stern mothering and paranoia, had failed. It was time she tried something new.\nHer people deserved better\u2014better than she, better than the caballero. If all that the gods could provide was blind hope inspired by a dying construct dressed in a thin disguise of divinity, who was she to deny that?\nShe went to visit Rosinand, to try to see him as the people did.\nOn that section of the market path where the lake overflowed into the swamp, he waited, docile and silent atop the flood, suffering the stings of mosquitoes with barely a switch of his tail, his red eyes glossy and shallow, the ill-sketched shapes of ribs standing out from his skin. The cigarette tree where she had tethered him was fruiting out of season. A few small fissures had opened in the flooded path at the horse\u2019s feet; foul water spilled ceaselessly down through them into some other reality. A pack of half-wild dogs moved restless at the lake\u2019s edge, lapping poisoned water with their long, black tongues and barking fearfully. Mar\u00eda flapped her arms and hissed at them until they fled.\nIt was nearing the end of rest time. She let Flores sleep until the bell.\n\u201cLet\u2019s visit Rosinand,\u201d she said at open doors, under the plastic-roofed pavilion of the village market, and in the maze of hammocks strung in avocado orchards that now must all be burned. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s sick. Nor does he deserve to suffer for what he is. We should throw him a feast.\u201d\nWith flower garlands, terracotta drums, and flutes, they marched in the sweltering afternoon along the lakeshore, bringing the best of everything Flores had left. For the sake of the dying god, they celebrated like they had something to celebrate.\nRosinand ate and drank only sparingly of honey, orchid blooms, and spirits, but he raised his head, shook his tail, and gave his attention to all that went on around him. Once or twice, he let out a feeble whinny. Cresencia wiped her tears and fed him by hand, enduring the horror of the horse\u2019s open maw with a stoicism that put Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda to shame. That black landscape opened and decayed around her until only scattered polygons remained in shades of fire and darkness. The land, the cigarette tree, and the tainted waters of the lake turned stranger, crystallizing into aberrant forms. Flies and mosquitoes pierced by the shards of collapsing polygons swelled to the size of grapes and burst; sunlight separated into glimmering spectra; mouths made moues and irises contracted in the surfaces of ripples. The revelers, musicians, and dancers of Flores backed slowly away\u2014all except for Cresencia, moist cheeked, quietly urging on Rosinand another mouthful of bromeliad petals, another sip of fiery spirit.\nYulia wrung her hands. \u201cDo something! Save her!\u201d\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda set aside her bowl of steamed squash with cardamom and mole and put down her tiny cup of drink. She looked around appraisingly at the people of Flores, her pueblo. They were fearful but awed\u2014as they had been of the caballero, and of the lake and the volcano before him, and once, long ago, even of Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda. She noted the conspicuous absence of Paquito and his friends, the music of flute and drum, ritual and solemn, the sweet, familiar smell of cornhusks glowing red and curling over coals.\nShe hobbled forward into the anomaly, stooping, arms extended to balance her toeless foot. She caught Cresencia tenderly about the waist, the flesh and bones fragile and soft beneath her hands, but still intact, still here. The twisted shape of Cresencia\u2019s malformed shoulder brought tears of sympathy to Mar\u00eda\u2019s hard eyes.\nThe fraying construct that was Rosinand, from so close, became still less coherent. The red eyes dissipated into empty sockets; the fleshless ribs were near-transparent; the floating hooves had disappeared below the knees. Beyond and through the horse-thing\u2019s lipless, gaping mouth, the flute players of Flores swayed, the lake reflected volcano and sky, the thatched roofs of the village steamed\u2014but none of it was the Flores Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda knew.\nShe turned away, shuddering, unable to deny but unwilling to countenance what she had seen, clutched by the choking terror that this Flores\u2014with its black lightnings, lightless fires, and flimsy half-solidity\u2014was the true one, and their own just a convenient dream.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done our best by him,\u201d she whispered to Cresencia. \u201cLet him go.\u201d\nTeetering, she carried the distraught Cresencia in her arms across the widening gap, the flood water boiling, pricking at her ankles, the air unyielding, a viscous fog of acetone and chainsaw gas.\nBreaking free into the solid world beyond the flood, she pitched to her knees, joints shrieking, and released Cresencia into Yulia\u2019s embrace.\nThe drummers ceased. The flute players shrilled, then trailed off into silence. Rosinand toppled into the overflowing stream, now no more than a half-liquid skull and a set of broken teeth.\nUnder the direction of Ad\u00e1n, the villagers of Flores erected a shrine to the memory of Rosinand, in a style evocative of the new gods but reminiscent of the oldest ones. They placed it on the plaza adjacent to the fountain; by a clever artifice, a streamer of clean water was drawn up from the cistern to spill from the stone horse\u2019s mouth, and it became a daily ritual to strew red bromeliad flowers at the statue\u2019s base and say a prayer for the prosperity of Flores and the health of its people.\nOver the next days, creepers overran the villa on the distant hillside, even as the cracks in its foundation propagated up the glowing stucco to the orange terracotta roof and at last brought it crumbling down. Paco and his friends never returned\u2014but some claimed to have seen a few small figures moving on the villa\u2019s grounds among the stands of solar panels and at the edges of the maize fields. Others held that these were tainted monkeys from the forest the caballero had persuaded into service with his honeyed tongue.\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda remained in her hut, weak and feverish, for many days after Rosinand\u2019s death and Cresencia\u2019s rescue; when at last she emerged, it was to a world less real than the one she remembered. She never forgot the vision of Flores, the lake, and her people as she had seen them through the horse\u2019s mouth. Indeed, the older she grew\u2014the closer to death\u2014she saw it more and more.\nAs she had feared, a new plague of deformations spread among the villagers\u2014limbs whole at dawn that were shriveled and useless by the time the rains had passed. A shortage of untainted food forced many to go hungry. Infants wasted away on their mothers\u2019 thin milk; children\u2019s bellies took on the bloat of malnutrition.\nAmong these tragedies, however\u2014which, Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda feared, failed to concern her as deeply as they ought\u2014there were miracles. Foremost among these was the change in Cresencia. She climbed from her hammock one morning to find her twisted shoulder straightened of its own accord, her constitution no longer sickly but strong. And the things she had seen\u2014the same that had caused this great change in Mar\u00eda\u2014had wrought in Cresencia new wisdom, a pragmatism beyond years that somehow retained the exuberance of youth, thus unshadowed by cynicism.\nMar\u00eda never understood this, but she was grateful. She\u2019d always known the time would come when she could no longer care for Flores, when they must care for her. The change had been sudden, and she hadn\u2019t seen the signs\u2014but now that it was here, she realized she\u2019d been ready long ago. It meant she could slacken her efforts, perhaps not worry quite so much, and try\u2014though unsuccessfully\u2014to forget.\nThere was always more clean earth to fetch from the volcano. And at rest times, when the afternoon sun had burned away the rain, Cresencia would sit among flowers heaped at the stone horse\u2019s feet, interpreting, for the people of Flores who gathered to hear her, the actions of the spectral men cast by the gleam of sunlight from her helmet.\nMichael J.

Z. Markson is not a real person, but I envy him. He is doubly unreal\u2014first, in that this name is a pseudonym behind which an actual person of flesh and blood has published a science fiction novel, and second, in that this name is not even the correct pseudonym. I have replaced it with a similar, and similarly fabricated, name. The reader of a roman \u00e0 clef would be disappointed without some veil to penetrate.\nDuring the writing of my third novel, I became obsessed with constructed languages, especially those designed to be perfectly logical. Lojban, for example, is rigorously unambiguous and regular in grammar and spelling. To wit:\nni\u2019o la cevni co\u2019a finti le tsani .e le terdi .i le terdi cu kalsa gi\u2019e kunti .ije le manku cu sefta le condi .i le ruxse\u2019i be la cevni cu fulta. . . .\nSo begins a famous book that in English starts, \u201cIn the beginning. . . .\u201d God, as you know, created the universe with words. Another synthetic language, Lincos\u2014or lingua cosmica\u2014is still more pure. Resembling mathematical equations, it contains within itself a kind of primer so that any message fragment, upon being discovered by an alien civilization, could be deciphered. Incredibly, these both failed to catch on with the general public.\nIn these constructed languages there is only one way to express any given thought. Alas, this is not so in English. How often have I wished to steal the words of another who\u2019d expressed my thoughts more aptly than I could, before I\u2019d had a chance to express them. This is where R. Z. Markson comes in. Under this pseudonym a real person\u2014if I wrote his name, you would recognize it\u2014published a novel that was soon revealed to be largely plagiarized. His thefts, he would later tell me, were clues out of the labyrinth.\nIf it knew what Markson really believed, the world would call him mad. Alienated would be a better description, to use the nineteenth century\u2019s name for mental illness. He was, indeed, estranged from the world. He was like the final survivor of some disappearing culture: an Ishi, a King Billy. In an interview, Markson claimed he\u2019d originally wanted to write his book in one of the languages of Ophiuchus itself but the publisher refused\u2014making a joke I later realized was no joke.\nA few years ago I traveled to a country I cannot name. It may not be in eastern Europe, but its politics, and its gray concrete architecture, certainly recall that region circa 1970. The regime permits the staging of approved works of theater, and it was to attend one of these productions that I\u2014together with a half dozen other American writers and artists\u2014went to the capital city.\nThe play\u2014which must also go unnamed, for obvious reasons\u2014is centuries old, and is a much-honored work in that country\u2019s literature. Its young director was said to be the most innovative in his country\u2019s theater. Our party arrived late at night. Seen from the airplane window, the city, home to many millions, was unusually dark. Besides the few of us, the plane was populated only by a scarce handful of, I assume, diplomats and businessmen in brown suits; they were unsmiling and did not speak. From the airport we were immediately driven to the theater. Over our objections, I might add, because we were tired after a long journey with many connections. Nevertheless, our host insisted we head directly to the theater, because despite the hour\u2014it was nearly midnight\u2014the play was about to begin.\nThe nineteenth-century theater was a massive stone building in the city center. The empty streets, wet from recent rain, reflected the alternating red and green lights that controlled the nonexistent traffic. We entered the spacious, red-carpeted lobby. The atmosphere was funereal. Only a few weak bulbs burned in the large chandeliers. There were no ushers or other employees; there were no patrons besides ourselves. Inside the auditorium, brass fittings glinted in the dim light, red velvet draped the stage and walls. The seven of us, plus our host, were the only audience. The curtains parted and the play began. The actors were heroic and statuesque. They declaimed their lines in stentorian voices. Yet despite the nonnaturalistic staging, the drama was absorbing, and the next several hours flew by. When it ended, we rubbed our eyes and walked out the bronze doors onto the street, where the first light of dawn was breaking.\nThe following evening I dined with the play\u2019s director. The young man was as dynamic and erudite as promised. He explained that while the regime allowed his plays to be produced, no one was allowed to attend. The entire country, he went on, was being converted to a staged show. I agreed that dictatorship encouraged falseness, but he said he meant something else entirely. Then he spun a wild fantasy of people being replaced by robots who believed they were the people they replaced, and how the world was a terrarium like you might keep laboratory rats in, and how he felt like the last man on Earth, the only one who remembered humanity as it had been. I was, he said, one of the few whom he could tell. His tone was ironic, so one could listen without laughing at the absurdity, but I sensed that under the irony he was serious and grew uneasy, as one would if an otherwise-reasonable acquaintance suddenly revealed an appreciation for cockfights or the sociology of Alfred Rosenburg. When I asked why he felt he could talk to me, he refused to answer.\nRecently, at a party given by my publisher in New York, I met the man who had assumed the name R. Z. Markson\u2014an older, graying gentleman. His career in academia, and a long history of criticism extolling the Greco-Roman and Early Modern English classics, made him feel that to publish a science fiction novel would be infra dig. Nevertheless he had long nursed a surreptitious interest in this, the lowest form of fiction imaginable, but this was not what inspired him to try his hand at it. We adjourned to a neighborhood bar and he told me, in all apparent seriousness, that his book was a record of absolute truth. His theory seemed to have something to do with identity in the modern world.\nIn the French Nouveau Roman, writers like Alain Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sarraute, and Michel Butor experimented with fiction that dispensed with characters. In Robbe-Grillet\u2019s Jealousy, for example, the narrator is elided from his own narration. Objects, places, persons, and actions are presented directly, but the eyes through which we see them belong to a mind that is a psychological void, a literal No One. In what is known as the Fregoli delusion, the patient is convinced that various people are actually the same person, either in disguise or somehow supernaturally changing appearances. Intermetamorphosis involves the conviction that one\u2019s acquaintances switch or trade identities. The Capgras delusion is the belief that friends and family have been replaced with imposters. Markson was certain they who suffered from these mental illnesses were not sick at all, but were the only sane individuals in a world where madness was a prerequisite. He wrote a science fiction novel\u2014which I shall call The Accursed Gioconda\u2014because the form allowed him to depict literally, by naturalistic mechanisms, what in the Nouveau Roman occurred simply via the ineffable auspices of fiction.\nNow you see why, aside from the danger of lawsuits, I have veiled these identities: no one would believe me! Who would guess that the aged scholar, a man to all appearances as cultured as his hero, John Ruskin, secretly believed in crazed conspiratorial fantasies?\nThen he promised to show me a device he\u2019d purchased at great expense from one of those men who risk their lives exploring the battlefields of the War of the Iron Tree, where the Amaranthine faction spread madness over half of Europe. This weapon allowed one to play on the human psyche as easily as a virtuoso plays a familiar tune on the piano. History and memory could be scraped clean and rewritten like soft, wet clay. Once I saw it, he averred, I would not be able to deny the truth.\nWe parted in the small morning hours. I returned to my hotel and slept until the following afternoon. Upon waking, I read in the Times of Markson\u2019s death\u2014of natural causes, in his hotel room, the door locked from the inside. Needless to say, no uncanny device was discovered there. Not long afterward, I learned of the death, on the other side of the world, of the dynamic young director. I went back to The Accursed Gioconda and found the following passage relevant.\nI\u2019m at liberty to quote at length here because the writer Markson plagiarized in this section was me.\nThe detached retina, in its earlier stages, produces photopsia: flashes of false light. These residues of a person\u2019s dying sight exist only in the brain, as it tries to interpret the neural impulses coming from the malfunctioning eye. In the total darkness of the cave, this hallucinatory aura may be the last thing you see.\nFrom childhood, the cave environment fascinated me, and it became my profession. My research at the University of \u2014\u2014 took me to the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. The karst landscape is conducive to cave formation, and there alone lives the olm. This troglodytic salamander spends its entire life underground, and is the largest animal to do so. It has an elongated serpentine body of yellowish- or pinkish-white, four tiny limbs, external gills that appear red from the blood close to the surface, and nonseeing eyes covered with skin. For perception, it relies on well-developed chemical and electrical senses. It\u2019s ironic this rare animal was my holy grail, since now I am essentially in its position. I went underground a man and come back up an olm, out of my element in the day-lit surface world.\nThe four of us were exploring the waterlogged caverns when I began to notice strange lights moving in the darkness. Then, as if in counterpoint to my overactive vision in the dark, my vision when the lamps were lit became dimmed. Retinal detachment is considered a medical emergency, but fortunately it is among the least painful of medical emergencies.\nI was blind, but my three colleagues helped me return to the surface. That\u2019s when we learned that our subterranean sojourn made us among the few humans on the planet not to have been exposed to a strange transmission. Apparently, while we were underground, Earth had been bombarded by a forty-eight-hour wave of exotic hadrons. These massive composite particles, made up of hundreds of bound quarks, of a structure no human scientist had contemplated, seemed themselves to be evidence of a superintelligent civilization. Yet there was the possibility also of them being simply a natural occurrence, the radiation of some hitherto unknown celestial object on the other side of the universe. In any case, the stream appeared at first to have no effect. A few days later, just as my team emerged into daylight, the first instances of xenoglossia appeared.\nThis term originally referred to an alleged paranormal phenomenon where an individual suddenly manifests the ability to speak a language he or she had never been exposed to. Despite many purported cases, there had never been a confirmation of xenoglossia before the transmission, and, in a sense, there still was not. To confirm xenoglossia in the old sense required a native speaker to verify the new language, but this new speech matched no language on Earth. Its speakers could, however, communicate with each other. Xenoglossic people began to congregate, and their behavior began to change. Without any declaration, they seceded in spirit. They simply did not participate in anything having to do with the old society. At first, their noncompliance with traffic laws and tax returns, and their total refusal to even acknowledge the apparatus of law, caused the authorities to jail thousands of them. But as thousands turned into hundreds of thousands, and the authorities themselves deserted their posts to join the Xenoglossics, this became impossible.\nThere were a few others who\u2019d escaped the transmission: miners and construction workers, mostly, a few geologists and spelunkers, and a pair of oceanographers who\u2019d been under ten thousand feet of water in a US Navy submersible. At first, because the Xenoglossia took time to appear, there were many who thought they\u2019d escaped, or were immune, but eventually they too began speaking the new language and drifted away. Only those who were underground during the whole of the transmission, or were otherwise protected, could be counted on not to turn.\nWe speculated on the purpose of the hadron wave. The collapse of our society, and its replacement by another inhabited by individuals who were physically the same but behaviorally very different, had happened too quickly for scientists to make much headway in studying the transmission. We had access to the abandoned university laboratories, but none of us knew enough about particle physics or astronomy to make use of them. One of my colleagues read aloud an article in the last-ever issue of Scientific American, which opined that the transmission was an invasion by means of a cosmic language, a kind of baryonic beaming of old minds into new heads.\nFor six months we lived off the detritus of our civilization. The Xenoglossics, of course, ignored us. Then one by one, members of our group\u2014even those who\u2019d had unimpeachable proof they\u2019d escaped the transmission\u2014began speaking the new language. It happened even to my own colleagues from the cave. I suspected them of faking. Perhaps after months of living in a crumbling, deserted city where grass and trees reclaimed the streets and ivy snaked up skyscrapers, they\u2019d simply wanted to be among other people, even if those people spoke an unknown language and had bizarre, incomprehensible customs. Maybe they just wanted to join the winning side. As I was unable to understand the Xenoglossia, I could never be sure whether they were faking. Regardless, inside of a year after the transmission, they were all gone.\nThis is the story of how I became the last man on Earth.\nIt\u2019s just science fiction, I told myself, putting down the book. Because R. Z. Markson died, doesn\u2019t make his beliefs true. Science fiction is usually metaphoric: a concretization of what is true in some more general or spiritual sense. In those terms, this passage from The Ziggurats of Ophiuchus by Robert Pritchard may reflect a simple feeling of alienation.\nBut something else gnawed at me. Had I\u2014in being the only person on Earth to connect the deaths of Markson and the young theater director\u2014glimpsed the furthest extremity of a plan that some Oedipa Maas, with more fortitude than I, could unravel? Perhaps I was one of those changed who were unaware, happily going about what we believed to be our lives, while in truth our familiar rituals are secretly those of the alien people we are becoming. There\u2019s no way to tell, since a race that could engineer exotic hadrons into a scalpel to commit interstellar psychosurgery would surely find it child\u2019s play to simultaneously remove the memory of their intervention from the minds of their subjects.

The song came on the radio at work and there was a little detonation of remembrance and I heard the story in my head. It was just a few lines set to rhyme about a man bringing nightmares to the north. I remembered every word and scribbled them on a napkin to study.\nThey say there\u2019s a kernel of truth to all folk tales and myths, and I meant to find this one somewhere in the empty lands and vast forests of that horned peninsula: a beast on the back of which I had once journeyed as a child, skipping across its spine and drifting through the thickness of its mane, my hands in its hair. Even then I think I had some idea that the truth was even larger than the story. The legend was the seed, and the truth was a tangled plant with questing tendrils that had since stretched into the Lower Peninsula: would they one day reach me? I didn\u2019t wait to find out.\nI traced the story to its origin as you might find a hive by the sight of bees. There were long days of driving through haunted, hallowed places looking for signs of restless nights. I lost myself in the northern wilderness and felt something close at hand, but just out of reach and invisible. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end: the configuration of the world is laid bare up there.\nBut then I found what I was looking for. Tahquamenon\u2014the silent roads, the puffy-eyed nappers, the campground handed over to the wilds without a fight\u2014was like an old hollowed tree around which bees hover. A bee lands, crawls into a hole you didn\u2019t see before: yes, this is it.\nThere were a few tourists come to see the falls, but the locals were easy to find. They were old proud hunters, wild children with weeds for jewelry, and thick-thighed women who more than once offered me places to eat and sleep. They told me that boys and girls still had bad dreams, but that the real nightmares had grown up with the children who first had them.\n\u201cI still can\u2019t sleep but once every few days,\u201d one of them told me. His hair was falling out in strange patterns and what was left was going gray. He was, like most of the others, in his late twenties or early thirties, and that\u2019s about how old the story was at that time. It doesn\u2019t take long for a story to be diluted and distorted, pulled in as many directions as there are people, like a message in a children\u2019s game of telephone.\n\u201cLast night I slept okay, but the night before and the night before that.\u201d The young man shook his head.\n\u201cNightmares?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the dreams anymore. What\u2019s in them doesn\u2019t really bother me. I mostly wake up before she puts them in.\u201d He patted his chest. \u201cShe\u2019s too heavy.\u201d\n\u201cWho is?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe woman with the caterpillar eyes.\u201d\n* * *\nFor the last time, Halden walked out of Reichert Tool & Die and left behind all the noise and heat and noxious fumes and\u2014little slivers of sliced metal built up in the corners of his trembling fingers\u2014went home to his wife and boys.\nJacob was doing homework on the dining room table, and the bee mo mo bee mo in another room meant the other was already done with his and playing video games. He would be hooked up to that black box of wonders like a patient to oxygen and might not even say goodbye and, when he finally came back to the real world, might wander outside and call once or twice into the darkness: \u201cDad?\u201d\n\u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready,\u201d his wife said. She was in the kitchen wearing ragged shorts and no shoes. Dark veins snaked up her calves. \u201cHow was work?\u201d She pulled a roast out of the oven.\n\u201cIt was all right. Hey, Jacob. How we doin\u2019?\u201d He bent over the boy\u2019s homework: numbers tangled together, some neat and typed, some wild and looping. \u201cNeed help?\u201d\n\u201cNah.\u201d\nHe was glad and wondered when his children had become smarter than him. He had gone to college and gotten some small degree (what did they call it, an Assistant\u2019s Degree?), but that was a long time ago and schools were better these days. Jacob was pulling numbers out his head like rabbits from a hat, and the other one. Already the teachers saw signs of some selective genius or autistic brilliance. He hardly believed he had anything to do with bringing them into the world.\nHe stepped into the bedroom and closed the door.\nThe truck was already full (packed in silence the night before), but there were things he couldn\u2019t take without her noticing. He had to gather those at the last moment, and so he did and thrust them all in an old army duffel: shirts and pants, long johns, socks, and a wad of bills poorly hidden in the top dresser drawer. He threw the fat duffel on the bed and paused to think about who he had shared it with, thinking of two: his wife and the one that wasn\u2019t.\nHe looked at the plastic bug house on the desk above the computer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to go, boys.\u201d\nHe pulled off the lid and lodged the house in the crook of an open window. Eventually the little caterpillars\u2014some slender and smooth, others fat and hairy, one with orange-tipped bristles like tiny paint brushes and a watchful blue eye on its back\u2014would crawl into the flowerbeds, where they could chew and chomp until they had had their fill. Cocoons would grow beneath leaves and twigs. One day they would wiggle, writhe, and hatch.\nHalden stood in the doorway with the duffel hanging on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he said, but the boys didn\u2019t hear.\nHis wife almost cried.\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Quiet. They\u2019ll hear you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just.\u201d She wiped her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you. I miss you when you\u2019re gone, you know. It\u2019s the little things that do it. The little motions and movements that stop when you\u2019re not here, finding something in another place after I come home from work. It\u2019s annoying when you\u2019re here, but. How long are you gonna be gone?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nHer eyes sparkled. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d and he walked out the door.\nHe threw the duffel on the passenger\u2019s seat and reached down to take his wallet out of his back pocket and tucked it in one of the little spaces between the seats, where it wouldn\u2019t make his butt go numb on the long ride north. The long ride from house to home: foliage changing along the sides of the highway, scattered stations on the radio, and air like the breath of summer. It was the pavement path to another life: the next life, one step higher on the helix that coiled through the cosmos. He opened his windows and sang. He peed in a bottle and tucked it under the seat to be emptied later, and stopped to watch a black bear lumber into the forest. Gray stone gave way to gravel. He was getting closer. Even the names of those great northern places suggested the numinous, not by any meaning or word origin, but by the very sound of their names. Manistique and Ontonagon, Ishpeming and Munising.\nAnd then he was there.\nHalden parked the truck and went down to the lake. He washed his hands first, and then his arms and face (scrubbing at the stubble), and\u2014before he knew it\u2014he was naked and swimming and rubbing sand on his chest, thighs, and up and down the cleft of his butt. He scraped his skin with the sand, released it, and watched it return to the bottom and with it his filth: factory dirt and domestic dust and\u2014deepest, darkest grit there was\u2014the fog of daily life accumulated over so many similar days, each filled with the anxious toiling that makes a man want to get on to the next day when there\u2019s so much left to be seen in this one.\nHe dove and wept under the water, but he was laughing when he came up for air. He let forth a great bursting bubble of laughter, and it sped across the top of the lake and reached two fishermen on a distant boat. Their tiny figures shifted and then settled back into relaxed positions as they waited for fish to bite.\nHalden left the lake without drying himself\u2014water trickling behind him, making little rivers for ants to ford\u2014and made camp. The pounding of tent stakes echoed through the trees. Camp made and a can of soup warming in the fire, he fell on his back to admire the sky and watch branches toss in the wind.\nHe remembered those branches.\nWhat faith had brought him back? Was it the same faith that led him to church every Sunday? Or perhaps that wasn\u2019t faith at all and only some faint duty or obligation. That was a shadow, and what brought him here the object that cast it. Did he even believe in God anymore, after all this?\nHe slurped his soup from the blackened can in which it had boiled.\n\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d he said, and the forest\u2019s massive wide emptiness made his voice sound small.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done everything you wanted. You can come out now. Mara. Mara?\u201d\n* * *\nI lived in his crooked Tahquamenon house.\nLiving there reminded me of camping because the electricity had been shut off and there was no running water. At night, surrounded by silent darkness, so many memories floated up from my consciousness. I remembered fishing through coolers\u2014the ice inside mostly melted\u2014to find the juice box I wanted among the floating jars of ketchup, milk, and mayonnaise. I remembered hearing thunder or something like it roll around the bowl of the lake and wondering if there was something greater than me out there. And I remembered building a fort of ferns with my brother, his fingers\u2014always poking about for frogs\u2014covered in duckweed. I started fires in the backyard and saw more things in the flames and shadows.\nI asked someone to visit me there, but he wouldn\u2019t, and so I met him at the coffee house where eerie antlered rabbits hung and sat and lounged about. Some looked ready to pounce or butt heads. I found him by the bright orange cap he said he would be wearing.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you meet me at the house?\u201d I said.\n\u201cBecause he used to live there.\u201d He pulled his cap away, swept his hair back, and replaced it. \u201cWouldn\u2019t touch it with a ten-foot pole.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the man that used to live there did something?\u201d\n\u201cI know he did. You do too or else you wouldn\u2019t be here asking these questions, poking around just like he did.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever see him? Do you know his name? What he looked like?\u201d\n\u201cMark? I don\u2019t know, something like that. I didn\u2019t see him, but my dad did and his cousin too.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be sure he was a real person?\u201d\n\u201cLook at this town, you think we don\u2019t know everything that happens? A dog on the other side of the falls can\u2019t keep a flea a secret. And you\u2019ve seen Paradise, right? How many people you think live in a little thing like that?\n\u201cAll I know is I never had a nightmare until he came to town, and after he holed up there and disappeared into the house, no one seen him much really, and he left, that\u2019s when it started. I wasn\u2019t a fussy boy before him. Almost to the day he left was when it started.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it start?\u201d\nHis coffee arrived, black and stinking. \u201cI woke up in the middle of the night and couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t move my arms, tried to call for Ma.\u201d He had to stop for a moment and take a drink.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be living in that house,\u201d he said.\nDid the man in the story sit on the sill of the living room window and look through the doorway into the kitchen and\u2014through that\u2014the doorway of the bathroom to see just how bent his house was? I sat there and marveled that the house still stood at all. I supposed it was built on a hill, but it didn\u2019t look like a hill to me. Closet doors came off their sliders. Little objects crept slowly this way or that until they fell off tables or counters. Some say it wasn\u2019t crooked when he moved in.\nLittle girls had nightmares too, and they were visited by a variety of dark and strange men, or things that looked like men to them.\n\u201cHe\u2019d sit on my chest just like a cat and look at me even though I couldn\u2019t see his eyes. He used to make me dream he was beautiful, and when I woke up I\u2019d want to marry him in the few seconds it took me to see that he was a black and cruel little man. He was like a cat you don\u2019t want in your bed anymore because he\u2019s been there all night. Like my momma\u2019s old cat Monkey. She called him that \u2019cause he was black.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else did you dream of?\u201d\nA car hit the rumble strip in the middle of the road and made a sound like the world unzipping, see what\u2019s inside?\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cI said I still do. I still have the nightmares. There\u2019s one with lots of shoelaces tying me down to the ground. Trees all around. Someone callin\u2019 for help, and it isn\u2019t me, but I should be. Some big bug or somethin\u2019 comes down from the trees. Scares the shit outta me every time even though I expect it now.\u201d\n\u201cDo you see him anymore? The catlike man?\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a cat.\u201d\n\u201cI know. But do you still see him?\u201d\n\u201cOnce in a while. He\u2019s gotten bigger, like he grew up right alongside me. I used to be pretty, you know. Don\u2019t laugh. I see you smiling.\u201d She smiled too. \u201cBut him. He got uglier. Bigger and uglier. I wonder where he\u2019ll go when I die. I don\u2019t like the nighttime anymore.\u201d\n* * *\nHe had a vision of a horse ridden wild in the night sweating in the stall the morning after.\n\u201cMara.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t so much a sound as a thing to be touched, like a brilliant streamer in the wind.\nHe reached out and touched it.\n\u201cWhy did you let me design your life? You follow every word and request.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that would happen?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It happens sometimes though. It must.\u201d\n\u201cAll those creeping crawlers. Supposed to scare me?\u201d\nThey came to him then, up to his chin. An inchworm did its pause-and-pull walk across the bridge of his nose, and he laughed.\n\u201cYou like them.\u201d\n\u201cI love them,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d\nShe nodded somewhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what I like. You know me, Mara.\u201d\n\u201cThe only one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and he could hear it echoing as he awakened.\n\u201cMara?\u201d\nThe sky was a dark bruise. He wondered if it might not rain.\n\u201cAre you here?\u201d he said, but he knew she was not: he could move and breathe, after all.\nHe unzipped the tent (a sound that always sent him back, and it was not the sound of a jacket zipper or the one on a suitcase: it was the sound of a tent being closed for the night and his body being tucked into a sleeping bag in which he would dream bright wonders, or a tent opened in the morning and his feet tripping on the little part at the bottom that didn\u2019t unzip because he was eager to be out and alive) and crawled inside. He lit the kerosene lantern that hissed all night. He only needed a radio now to make the image complete. That and his father, laughing and humming and busying his hands with this or that. He could almost see the fire through the wall of the tent and his father\u2019s silhouette, his hands dancing in the night. His own private puppet show.\nHis hair flew up in a knot, and she was there.\nHe laughed at what she did to his hair. \u201cYou better untangle that after you\u2019re done. Hey, can I see you now?\u201d Halden asked.\n\u201cShhhh. Not yet. Time to rest.\u201d\n\u201cHow about now?\u201d\n\u201cShh.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember how we met?\u201d\nShe showed him that she did.\nHalden was eight or nine again, waking in the middle of the night, made paralyzed and breathless by a weight on his chest: a spot of darkness blacker than the black room around him. He saw the gleam of tooth or eye or horn in passing moonlight. He slept past one, two, three alarms.\n\u201cGod, Mom, give me a break, she rode me all night.\u201d Halden laughed. \u201cI actually told her that, didn\u2019t I? Something like that.\u201d\n\u201cWas I there?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But you are now. Come here.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\nHe was riding a deer down a dark soil road, its skull visible in the moonlight. Rain pooled in eerie three-toed footprints.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cWake me up.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care if you are asleep or awake?\u201d\n\u201cI want to be with you when I\u2019m awake.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d but he didn\u2019t know, or he didn\u2019t know how to say it. Maybe there was no difference after all, or one only his dream self perceived, or perhaps it was the other way around.\n\u201cNever mind. This is fine.\u201d The deer waded through fallen leaves and ate a few along the way. Halden did the same, and they tasted like almonds and beer. \u201cThis is great.\u201d\n\u201cI can make it better,\u201d she said, and she did.\n\u201cSee, this is why I\u2019m here, why I came.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cBut.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cMara, after you knew I liked you, when I was a boy, and you didn\u2019t go away. I\u2019ve never asked, but why did you ask all those things of me?\u201d\nLeaves swirled around him, hid him, and hid the world or the dream world or both.\n\u201cYou will find out soon,\u201d she said.\n* * *\nClusters of bagworms swung in the wind in the trees behind the crooked house. I didn\u2019t dream there, as if a screen or veil kept them from me, or perhaps there was a focus, like a rod for lightning: the others in the town who have grown up with their nightmares.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you move?\u201d I asked one of them.\n\u201cShe goes where I go.\u201d\nI asked if he could tell me what she looks like (those eyes!) but he couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to, and so I let him be.\nIn the crooked house, a sampler above the front door reads, \u201cCaterpillars and baby caterpillars, I am going, follow me.\u201d I said it aloud like a chant many times, but they never came. I was alone most of the summer, and I went to the campground alone.\nI hiked through fern-engulfed glades and broke through the forest and stepped onto a rocky road that wound up and down the hills, small campsites along the way like beads on a rope. They were marked with posts driven into the earth. The numbers were just little smudges now.\nWhere did he sleep and dream: number eight, number fourteen, or all of them at one time or another? I looked in the burnt-out shells where campfires burned a decade ago and into the trees above, as if his dreams might be hovering there still. Mullein stalks stood in an empty campsite, two tall, two short, like parents and their children. I walked up and down the stony road. Had he wandered there after a rain storm and looked to the road and found his gaze met by the fossil eyes of a Petoskey stone? Maybe he collected them and secreted them away somewhere in the crooked house, and I would find them if nothing else, something to take back for my trouble.\nI sat at one of the picnic tables, the weeds beneath grown so thick and tall that they hugged my legs and grew through the spaces between the boards on top. The tassels overlooked my pen and paper, as if about to make corrections. Maybe they would tell me how it all went.\nBut there was nothing there. No name chiseled on a picnic table or heart carved into a tree. As I was leaving, I saw a woman sitting by the lake. She was holding a burden that turned out to be a baby.\nShe liked the peace of the place.\n\u201cThe baby doesn\u2019t cry as much here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDoes he have nightmares?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSorry. I thought maybe that\u2019s why he cried.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yeah. Maybe.\u201d She thought for a moment and then recognized me. It was my question that gave it away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d she said. \u201cHe left his family. How could he do that? What would make a man just up and leave like that?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to find out.\u201d\n\u201cBut why would you want to? Who cares? Just let everyone forget that old bastard.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we at least try to understand? Maybe then we could\u2014\u201d but she didn\u2019t agree and stopped paying attention, so I left and accidentally carried a big wooly worm into town.\n* * *\nHalden pulled into the gas station, the only place his old cell phone received a signal. He flipped open the scarred cover and called her.\n\u201cOh my God, Halden? Halden, it\u2019s been three weeks.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know it had been that long. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sorry? What the hell are you doing? Do you know what I\u2019ve been going through? Halden, are you, are you leaving me?\u201d Words were lost in sobs.\nHalden tossed the phone into the dirt, ran his fingers through his hair, and picked it up again. He put it to his ear, but she wasn\u2019t done.\n\u201cListen,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo, you listen,\u201d and she went on, but he heard a boy\u2019s voice between her cries (\u201cDad? Is it Dad?\u201d).\n\u201cIs that Jacob?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. But\u2014\u201d\nThe other one, then. He smiled. \u201cMake sure you tickle his back when you tuck him in. Hey. Listen to me. Please. Shut up for a second. I left you what I\u2019ve saved. Most of it anyway. You know where it is. Tell your parents whatever you want. Everything\u2019s worked out with Mom. And take care of the boys and tell them that. That I. Uh,\u201d but he couldn\u2019t think of anything that might make sense and wondered if it would matter anyway to them, who both always seemed so distant: polite and reserved, not like they were with their mother\u2014always joking, laughing, playing silly little games\u2014whom they must love so much more.\n\u201cTell them I love them, I guess.\u201d\nHe held the phone at his waist and let her cry herself out and say whatever she wished to say. A crow landed nearby and poked at something in the gravel and cawed, as if warning Halden not to take it.\nHalden smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours,\u201d he said.\nThe crow muttered, speared his meal, and\u2014dead mouse dangling from his beak\u2014flew to the branch of a tree.\nHalden returned the phone to his ear.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d his wife said. \u201cWhat stole you from me?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. No, really, really you can\u2019t imagine. You never had much of an imagination. Not like the boys.\u201d\nBut she wasn\u2019t listening.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Halden said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t try to forgive me. And don\u2019t try to find me.\u201d He snapped the phone shut with a click like a crow\u2019s beak closing.\nThat was the last they heard of him for a long time, but he didn\u2019t think about that on the way back to the campground, the lake, sleep.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Halden said.\nSomething small and many-legged crawled up his arm, and then he was crawling up one of its legs.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does anyone love anything?\u201d The bug\u2019s legs became nests for giant birds that fed on Halden\u2019s skin. Their singing beaks tickled his flesh.\n\u201cWake up.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d He jumped out of a nest and he was there in the tent. Sunlight had made an oven of it. \u201cHuh? Are you here?\u201d\nShe giggled.\n\u201cYou are.\u201d He opened the windows and the door and let in a cool breeze off the lake.\n\u201cMara?\u201d\n\u201cI told you I cannot love like you.\u201d\nHalden tried to grab her.\n\u201cYou will always miss.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d He tried again and sighed. \u201cMara.\u201d\n\u201cHalden?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re told a lot about love, and some people even tell us how to love, like the church. My mom.\u201d A doe fed just beyond the picnic table, and Halden wondered how long it had been there. \u201cSee that doe there? Can you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know I love that doe? Not as much as you, but I do. And she probably doesn\u2019t even know it. And that\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t need anything back. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve had enough, I think.\u201d\nHe fell back and scratched his big round belly and the belly button that spilled out of its bowl just a little. \u201cI still want to see you though. That won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\u201cYou will hate me.\u201d\n\u201cMara.\u201d\n\u201cYou will.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise. I\u2019ll love you more.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not know that.\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Just let me see, oh!\u201d and he did, but she was smooth and flat and full of muscle and had a thin trail of hair that led to a curled horn between his legs.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Halden rubbed his chin. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cSee. You hate me.\u201d\n\u201cHey, no, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind. Look.\u201d He laughed and pulled off his long johns. \u201cSee.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cMara. Yes. Come here.\u201d\nThe great horn unfurled.\n* * *\nNo one knows where he went after he left the crooked house, and some say he never left at all.\nI felt silly looking in closets and the attic\u2014pulling the cord to unfold flimsy zigzag steps\u2014but I wasn\u2019t really looking for a living man, only a body or signs that one was once there. There were no old journals or letters left behind. There were no secret chambers, no messages spelled out in rat turds. There was hardly anything that meant a man had lived there at all, nothing to indicate that he had suddenly stood and walked out the door into the night.\nI was sitting on the porch watching iridescent green beetles skitter across the sidewalk and wondering if he had done the same when a car pulled into the driveway. A woman stepped out, a bandage wrapped around the crook of her elbow as if she had just given blood. There was something wrong with her legs.\n\u201cI\u2019m here about the nightmares,\u201d she said and smiled.\nI could tell she wasn\u2019t afraid, and we sat on the porch and shared her story.\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t believe in ghosts. And I don\u2019t believe in demons or witches or any of that, but I can tell you there\u2019s something in my room at night.\u201d\n\u201cHave you heard the rhyme?\u201d She hadn\u2019t, and I recited it for her. I still had the napkin in my back pocket, but I didn\u2019t need it.\nShe chuckled. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s a little too simple though. The rhyming makes it sound like a game.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like that? It\u2019s more serious.\u201d\n\u201cWell. This whole thing messed with a lot of lives.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI never met the man you\u2019re asking about, but\u201d\u2014she reached out and brushed something from my shoulder\u2014\u201cyou know, it\u2019s all right. A lot of the others whine about it, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some real pain there. You\u2019ve talked to them.\u201d\n\u201cSome of them.\u201d There was a strand of silk from my hair to my shoulder. \u201cBut some wouldn\u2019t talk to me. And the parents or uncles and aunts, the old ones that were here when he was here, who saw him or talked to him, they didn\u2019t even want to look at me.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\u201cBut you came.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I dunno. I\u2019m fine, I guess. The older I get and the weaker I get\u2014my legs are going, you know\u2014the more I like sleeping. I sleep all day sometimes. Just to dream. I mean, there\u2019s a real presence there sometimes. Like the others say, yeah, I\u2019ve heard all about it, we share stories and dreams, but you know what?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI kinda like my nightmares.\u201d\n* * *\nHalden returned to the campground even after it was closed because the state couldn\u2019t afford it anymore. A rusty red gate swung shut, and it was as if he had been closed out of the next life: the end of the road.\nHe bought a crooked house nearby and hunted for food and sometimes stole what he needed on moonless nights. He lost his phone. His hair grew longer. And he didn\u2019t dream during those days, as if something fed upon them before they reached him.\nHalden would walk out into the night and call for him.\n\u201cMara. Mara. Mara?\u201d\nBut the streamer was silent in the wind.\nHe was gone then, and Halden felt in that loss every abandonment and divorce he had ever felt: the shattering of childhood at the gate to adolescence; moving away from his parents and his first home; the hardening of his heart for earthly love; the little jobs lost and the familiar faces moving away and the loneliness of a hospital visit; and the very fact that he had even once been removed by force\u2014his tiny hands grabbing roots on the shore and not letting go\u2014from the forest of ferns and old oaks by the lake he had been to in the womb.\nHis world seemed darker (moonlit, he thought) as the days went on, and his thoughts were not his own. He thought he saw heavy bags hanging from the ceiling, and he shot arrows through the walls. In brief moments of clarity, he had to wonder.\n\u201cMara?\u201d\nA wasp with a long body like a wizard\u2019s bottle alighted on his hand, and Halden watched as it drove its stinger into the flesh between his thumb and first finger. He brushed it away and walked into the house to wipe it with the damp green marker his mother always used for beestings and bug bites. In the hallway he began to tingle, as if he had washed himself with peppermint soap. He fell asleep a moment later, and that began a perpetual ascending and descending to and from a dreamless land of sleep, but Mara wasn\u2019t there.\nHis head filled with swirls and whirls. His vision blurred, as if his eyes were covered in dew, condensation from all the fog inside his head. He became drowsier as the days went on, and he lost weeks and months\u2014he didn\u2019t know how long\u2014to dizziness and headaches. He often woke in a tangle of limbs and sheets, and once he was so famished that he rushed out the front door and onto the lawn. Before he knew it, he was nibbling clover petals.\nHe could imagine what it must taste like to the insects that sipped its nectar: such a delicate sweetness to him, but to them, ambrosia. He plucked a few petals from the center of the pale purple flower and bit into the ends and by sundown he had left none for the butterflies. The day after, he ate the patterned leaves instead.\nHe made and ate salads of petunia and raspberry and mint and thistle. He liked the fragrant moistness of tomato stems and the puffy pods of milkweed. He ate bull thistle, chickweed, giant foxtail, and sweet little leaves of lambsquarters. He learned how buttercups got their name.\nSeasons changed.\nHe gathered every blanket in the house and pressed them to his body. He tore the curtains down and pulled the covers from the couch cushions. He coiled them all around him and fell back on his pillow into a dreamless slumber that lasted days and days.\nHe awakened just before sunrise (a sliver of sun not yet mounting the horizon), his head full and fluttering, and there was a sensation as of wings unfolding just behind his eyes: a hundred moths as big as a hand suddenly released from pulsing cocoons and flying away in all directions.\n* * *\nThe last rain of that summer drenched me as I sat in the front yard of the crooked house trying to untangle the story of the man who brought nightmares to Tahquamenon. A blade of grass was brought to second life with a tremble when struck from above by something it probably could not fathom. It was the first drop of rain. Many more followed.\nI stayed at the crooked house until the end of summer, when the first leaves fell like little yellow butterflies swooping down for a drink. I left on the morning after the night I finally had a dream.\nMy shoes beat a path to the trunk of a tree in which lived an old, old man. He came out and sat on the limbs with his eyes closed, and his weight was enough to make the branches sag and nearly break. There was a tiny hole in his head through which dreams could come and go and he held a ball of caterpillars to the moon. There was another man at the bottom of the tree who wasn\u2019t me. He had long, wild hair. He kept looking up at the branches, and the old man popped out of the tree when he wasn\u2019t looking, like a cuckoo in an ancient clock, but he finally caught a glimpse of him and smiled. The man with the wild hair looked at me then and my dream self wasn\u2019t surprised when he spoke. We had a nice talk.\nI still can\u2019t be sure it was all a dream.\nKyle E.

A place of two worlds\u2014she has inhabited neither for many a year. Dragons run riot in both, but can only be seen in one. She prepares herself now to ride another dragon to a new, redder place, hoping her old companion won\u2019t be jealous.\nHer head instinctively dodges a long-disappeared orrery. Knees and elbows jostle for space next to the tiny desk now empty of science trophies, single bed still covered in a faded candlewick spread, and denuded walls showing their tan lines. There\u2019s a ghost of spilled perfume intertwined with the heat from a vacuum cleaner motor. Just far enough away, and years ago, a lawn mower mutters over the whomp of Nika\u2019s embarrassing vinyl, sent to her by her brother in South Africa, and a symphony of heat creaks. This is suburbia, watched over by the forty-hour knights.\nOnce guarded over by shining godlings and the humbling eye of the Hubble, the wardrobe was, is, where things are Kept.\nFor those times she would silently grab her jacket and make a dash for it, Ani used to keep the hinges well oiled, though Gareth never much liked the smell. Busy with oiling minds and hearts to an esoteric task, she has left the hinges and dragon a long while untended.\n\u201cSo, an epic journey, is it?\u201d rumbles a voice that could fill valleys and tumble peaks if allowed to perform opera. The voice is muffled by the scant inches of wood and time.\nNo apologies are called for, such is Gareth\u2019s way. A sigh Ani has learned well to use only in the safe space of alone escapes. Her brown fingers, dented with a few more years than should have been proper to open this door, clasp the door knob, and turn.\n\u201cAn engineer\u2019s hand,\u201d Gareth observes from beneath bronze eye feathers and coat hangers singing a lament to satin that had never dressed their shoulders. Gareth passes Ani a box of Wonder Woman toys. She contemplates the contents, looking from the \u201cKeep\u201d to the \u201cRecycle\u201d to the \u201cCharity\u201d box.\n\u201cPhysicist,\u201d Ani clarifies, selecting the least battered figurine and placing the rest carefully in the charity box.\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve figured out how I can fly in your gravity?\u201d Gareth chuckles, nostrils whuffing up dust bunnies and the decaying carcasses of blowflies.\n\u201cA long time ago, my love. Third-form science fair project.\u201d Ani ventures a smile, but Gareth snorts more dust for the practised response.\nHer lips falter, then curve up and down at the same time, amusement trapped against teeth that had not been as small or as straight as Tina Cooper\u2019s. Gareth keeps his council now on performing smiles for dragon favours; he remembers those arguments and how Ani learned to breathe fire before he did.\nGareth passes over a box of books, and just for good measure opens that final school magazine, a giant claw delicately tapping a photo full of atrocious hairstyles and sidelong looks. \u201cAnd where is Tina Cooper now?\u201d\nAni offers up a shrug more suited to her petulant thirteen-year-old self, who is watching from the corner\u2014back and forth, recursive in time, filling up the room with sweat and hair and silence\u2014fingers screwed tight around equal first prize certificate and monies split two ways.\n\u201cRunning a gardening centre I suspect.\u201d Ani\u2019s mother has made sure she does not suspect, but she wants to throw away the battered certificate without the regret that oozes out of the pores of the walls. Sixteen-year-old Ani steps forward, shakes her head slicked smooth and silky black, plucks the useless papers from her fingers, and throws them into the recycle box.\n\u201cAnd where are you?\u201d Gareth rests his long chin in his claws, dribbles of smoke mixing with the dust that dances sideways down sunlight and genuflects to the carpet.\n\u201cMars,\u201d Ani says, as matter-of-fact as she can. She has been practising.\n\u201cAh, the red place.\u201d Gareth nods slowly, setting the coat hangers off into a Wagnerian treatise to faded denim. Ani shuts them up with a gather of one hand. They mutter a fractious refrain from the recycle box, then lie still.\n\u201cRed, just like me,\u201d Gareth says in response to Ani\u2019s silence. She rewards him with a look much louder than usual, even in response to such a falsehood. \u201cWell, I could be red again. It\u2019s completely up to you.\u201d\nEight-year-old Ani sits at the desk shaping Gareth out of red play dough. It\u2019s not the real, store-bought dough, a school treat smooth and fine and warm beneath her searching fingers. She does not create fat plaited hair like other girls have done, imitated with sideways smirks at her thick woollen bunch. No, this dough is cobbled together from flour, water, and salt, splotched with Nika\u2019s limited pantry of colours.\nDough Gareth is red, like the tips of her fingers, which she licks small bites of dough from, a substitute for the always-empty biscuit tin. Ani is displeased with the inadequate, crumbling representation of her dragon that does nothing to show his grandeur, but Nika smiles regardless.\nNika smiles less when fourteen-year-old Ani is still drawing Gareth, but that might not be her daughter\u2019s or the dragon\u2019s fault. Red is not the colour of proper dreams.\nThe wardrobe is now almost empty. Only a couple of bags of school papers remain, and they go into the recycle box with barely a glance from Ani sixteen. There are other papers much more important, but they sit in places and boxes Nika or Tina Cooper or even Gareth would be unlikely to open.\nAnd now, there is only Gareth, neck cricked at an impossible angle beneath the shelf. Eye feathers sweep scaled cheeks as they share regard.\n\u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d She has allowed herself many sighs this day, having stored them up to share only with herself. It is good practise for the long, cramped months ahead, the storing, collecting, and cataloguing of sighs and smiles, shoulders and hands just so, no threat.\n\u201cWhat you have always done,\u201d Gareth replies, head easing out and hovering over the lintel of the wardrobe, but never transgressing. \u201cTake me with you.\u201d\n\u201cBut where I\u2019m going the wardrobe is so very, very small. It\u2019s not even a wardrobe at all.\u201d Ani shapes her hands, just so by just so. \u201cAnd I definitely have no weight allowance for a dragon.\u201d\n\u201cBut where is your head, girl!\u201d Gareth cries, and somewhere behind him sheep startle and skitter down a grassy meadow.\n\u201cIn the clouds, obviously.\u201d Ani appropriates the imprecation and a slow smirk. She has forgotten how good it feels to be dangerous around her dragon.\n\u201cI told you that\u2019s where it should stay,\u201d Gareth scolds, his eyes twinkling a king\u2019s ransom to belie the sting of his words.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve always listened to you, dear heart, even when I thought I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Ani reaches up to scratch where his right wing meets the shoulder, a place he can never reach. Gareth bends into the caress, rumbling and purring, eyes oozing shut.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fit into any space you put me in,\u201d Gareth says, his voice ticking with pleasure, like the small coolings of the house late on a summer\u2019s evening.\n\u201cBut you will be so cramped.\u201d Ani\u2019s protests are feeble, because each one of her in that room has already made up her mind.\n\u201cTish. Just so long as I have a back door, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nAni tries to peer past her large lizard friend into the depths of the old wardrobe. \u201cIs that what you\u2019ve always had back there? An escape hatch for when I wasn\u2019t looking? So you could go fly with your dragon friends?\u201d\n\u201cAnd run with the unicorns, yes.\u201d Gareth has never worried about his smile scaring anyone off, despite the number of teeth. The larger the smile, the better.\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that like\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, it is nothing like that other place,\u201d Gareth snorts. A small puff of smoke redolent of cigars and beeswax curls around their heads. \u201cIt snows when it is supposed to in July, you don\u2019t need winter coats where we go, and everyone can eat whatever lollies they jolly well please.\u201d\nAni laughs, a strange sound, and the ears of the room prick up. A seventeen-year-old Ani with braids tight against her skull glares at them from the desk, fingers poised over a battered laptop, writing a physics paper that will furrow the brow of her teacher.\n\u201cYou are so very young, dear Gareth,\u201d she whispers. \u201cI just can\u2019t bring myself to put you in any of those boxes.\u201d\nGareth brings a wing around for a better view. He beams again, dragonish, for the red hue of his scales.\nAni is buttoning a shirt pocket as her mother enters the room, hands dusty from other years. \u201cAll done?\u201d Nika asks, a quaver, a semitone.\n\u201cAll done,\u201d Ani confirms, indicating the three boxes, one quite empty, one quite full. \u201cDon\u2019t need much where I\u2019m going.\u201d\nNika frowns at this, as she does every time, but says nothing, as she does every time. She folds the box tops closed, not even bothering to recatalogue the contents.\nOn the way out with the heaviest box first, she stops, turns, and nods at the open wardrobe door, her long braids clicking. \u201cWhat about Gareth?\u201d\nAni freezes, rearranging her face to neutrality.\nNika pierces her with a look over the top of her glasses, the first smile in days hinting at the corner of her plump lips.\n\u201cShe knows. She\u2019s always known,\u201d Gareth whispers from her pocket. \u201cWhy did you think otherwise?\u201d\nAni nods. For just a moment, she wishes she could take her mother with her.\nAnd then it is gone.\nAni pats the pocket over her left breast, reassuring the warm lump of dragon curled there as well as her mother. Nika drops a single nod and looks away before anything else gets unsaid.\n\u201cGood. Help me carry these out to the truck. Tokyo won\u2019t wait forever, ya know.\u201d\nAni straps herself into her seat for another day of hurry-up-and-wait, headaches and tasteless food, surrounded by a world of tiny lights, metal, and promise. She\u2019s a long way from the bedroom wardrobe, a long way from anything.\nWhen watching the diamond-studded black becomes old real quick, there\u2019s always weathering the barbs and arrows of endless, elegant equations that someone wants to argue over\u2014hers more than others\u2014as a tinge of desperate sweat recycles in the air. Come along red planet, head in the clouds.\nBai Ryu, more cattle herder than commander, settles into the seat beside Ani and smiles pleasantly enough over at her, hands poised above a screen ready for her own exacting equations.\nAni experiments with a smile back. She likes their robust team leader with her perpetual smile around the eyes and nicely proportioned skull beneath the number one\u2014Ani of just six months ago tests her own bumpy scalp with her hands\u2014but in the confines of the ship, elbow to elbow with just a few dozen, Ani must practise the courtesy she was chosen for. She\u2019s good at it. It serves her well.\nGareth squirms against Ani\u2019s chest, and she habitually pats the left pocket of her jumpsuit.\nA movement out the corner of her eye\u2014Ryu is mimicking her, patting her own left pocket. Ani reassesses the freckles and small blemishes on the woman\u2019s face. Usually a master at the quick judgment, she can\u2019t read the commander at all in that moment. Ani looks away, trying but failing not to stare at the woman\u2019s chest.\nA tiny black scaled head is poking out of Ryu\u2019s breast pocket. The commander absently scratches its head as tiny golden eyes and forked tongue flicker in pleasure.\nRyu cuts a glance, the side of her mouth to Ani curling up ever so slightly.\nAni glances back, scratching Gareth\u2019s red head. She bites the corner of her mouth into an unfamiliar smile that startles her face and her dragon friend.\nAJ Fitzwater is a dragon wrangler of high repute from Christchurch, New Zealand (a.k.a.

Easy.\nI liked the scarcity of those sorts of events in my career, that mostly I fought muggers or foiled bank heists or stopped the poaching for taxidermy of extradimensional creatures.\nI suppose I do deserve better. For certain definitions of the word.\n* * *\n6. Have Mrs. Johansen purge all files in \u201cRetirement Plans\u201d folder on network; shred hard copies. (Note: get back to Fantastica\u2019s text re: sidekick recruitment\u2014news travels so fucking fast. No.)\n2c. Sphinx (cont.)\n\u2014Museum donation? (That would be a card: \u201cSphinx [provenance, species, genus unknown; existence unconfirmed], donated by the Harrier, masked vigilante [existence unconfirmed], originally captured, killed, and taxidermied by Dr. Epoch [rumored; existence also unconfirmed] October 2013\u201d)\n\u2014Nick\u2019s face the first time he saw that thing looming up out of the shadows. Utter terror. The scream echoed off the walls and lingered in the air as he breathed hard. Served him right for breaking in here in the first place.\n* * *\nEidolon was such a goddamned hero\u2014dusting the sphinx, for one thing, and how many eighteen-year-olds can broker an interdimensional peace treaty with their mentor on the floor, bleeding from injuries sustained trying to fight people the size of a building? The same one who rappelled down a building using a grappling hook to catch a cat burglar; the one who parkoured up a building after the Gecko, cape billowing behind him. Always grinning. \u201cThat was too easy.\u201d\nWell. He wasn\u2019t grinning when he was shouting so the giants could hear him. He glanced at me every few minutes, but otherwise you\u2019d never know he was anything but calm.\nAnd ridiculously intelligent\u2014knew that from Day 1, didn\u2019t I? Took the tech the giants gave him as a thank you for the treaty and built the leviathan gun.\n* * *\n7. Seal Brobdingnagian Rift\n\u2014Since I\u2019m repairing things, anyway, may as well seal that up. It\u2019s been years since the last giant invasion, but they always liked Eidolon and the treaty won\u2019t last forever. Agreements never do.\n8. Redecoration\n\u2014Maybe some color. I\u2019m no kid anymore; the white and chrome aesthetic could use an upgrade\u2014it looks like a computer store in here. Something warmer. Wood?\n* * *\nHe said he touched nothing besides that goddamned gun, which is of course a lie. He\u2019s all over this place, now: the air, the echoes; splashed over the trophies, the walls, the consoles, and the chair like paint or blood or ectoplasm.\nAt least I was smart enough to keep the Sanctuary well away from the house.\nSat in my chair. Smiled at me with all his teeth.\nCrumpled on the floor behind him, Eidolon\u2019s cape, a boot on its side, shadows too thick to see the rest. And I knew what I was looking at, once I saw that. I feel like I should have expected it.\n* * *\n9. Uniform\n\u2014Cleaning of Eidolon uniform; have Mrs. Johansen prepare it for placement in the display case.\n\u2014Move display case to back of HQ, possibly where sphinx is currently placed.\n10. Future Reference\n\u2014\u201cThe Daemon\u2019s\u201d suit: dark red and black (maybe dark blue, hard to tell; that\u2019s a dark area back there, command central; he had Mrs. Johansen on the main screen, the little bastard, though he\u2019s in for a goddamned surprise if he goes after her; even thirty years later that alien assassin training\u2019s no joke). Anarchy symbol\u2014how original, like the colors, no, you don\u2019t look like a jackass at all\u2014etched into the front. (Note: reach out to all costumers in the area with queries. Also internet alerts, need keywords.)\n\u2014Mask: red as well, no cowl, covers eyes only, tied in the back like a bloody pirate, which will not end well; apparently paying attention to history and tactics was too much effort.\n* * *\nHe was so fucking proud of himself the first time, for breaking the lock, bypassing the security system, getting all the way down here. And then the damn stuffed sphinx made him scream. Not even the Harrier emerging from the shadows made him react like that; no, when he saw me, he got the biggest goddamned toothy grin on his face. Like he couldn\u2019t believe he got to do this.\nHe didn\u2019t have to break in or bypass anything today.\nSame smile, though: aimed right at me as he pointed his gun at the outer wall and pulled the trigger.\nLaura E.

For stupid reasons and for good ones, too. You can wait for them in places where people gather, in places that might have mattered.\n2.\nMost of the machines are small, subtle. Keep an eye out for gaudy jewelry, nice watches, too-heavy suitcases. Look for people who rummage in fanny packs, and watch for the unseasonably dressed. They forget the weather; they come from ice ages or desert earths and they dress for those, they misjudge or misremember the climate of the past. For a November wedding, they\u2019ll arrive in a thin violet button-up, no coat or sweater. They\u2019ll look up at the sky and smile wryly at the flurry, like it\u2019s a prank and someone has gotten them good.\n3.\nWhen they\u2019re sleeping, look for birthmarks and deformities. A knob below the sternum, a bump along the spine. Like metal, like a ball bearing, just beneath the soft skin of the throat. Sometimes this is the machine, secreted away in the body of the traveler.\n4.\nThey may be touchy or distant. They may not know how to keep a conversation going. Don\u2019t be discouraged if they only want to talk about you. Don\u2019t be discouraged if they only want to talk about themselves. They could be historians drinking away their travel grants. They could be tourists or exiles. They won\u2019t tell you exactly who they are. Offer them water if they\u2019re thirsty or too nauseous to speak. They may need a place to stay.\n5.\nThey can\u2019t take you home with them, or they won\u2019t. If you have a getaway plan, if you\u2019re hoping to hitch a ride into another eventuality, forget about it. If you ask them why that is, why they can\u2019t carry you forward, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s a problem of futures, that you have too many.\n6.\nYou\u2019ll lose them quickly, but don\u2019t hold that against them. You\u2019ll find and lose and find them again. Look for the ones who set fire to park benches, who linger in bowling alleys but never bowl. Who on sidewalks outside churches speak wistfully of their many scattered husbands. Look for the ones who stop to shovel dead deer from funeral roads. Spend the day following them. Spend the week following them. They won\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re doing, or not at first, so you will have to keep on asking.\n7.\nAre you visiting family? Are you here on business?\n8.\nYou want to stock up on brussels sprouts while you still can, they\u2019ll say. Or, You got to see what\u2019s going up in the old Blockbuster lot. You may not be able to tell when they\u2019re teasing you.\n9.\nLook for the tired eyed. The past is exhausting. If they take notes, read them. If they keep a journal, read it. Devise little tests: ask if they want to visit imaginary cities, eat invented dishes. Figure out what they know about the past and what they don\u2019t. Figure out what they know about you and what they don\u2019t. Think about the way they wake up, what it says about them. Do they get up before the alarm, or do they sleep through? Do they stare at the ceiling, persuading themselves to wake up, or do they turn over and hold you? Do they use all your hot water? You may have to teach them things they should already know: how to work a cell phone, how to open a bottle of wine.\n10.\nRemember: you can\u2019t make them appear. All you can do is wait in the right places.\n11.\nThey disappear. They come back. Winking in and out like bad bulbs. For a long time, this is how it will be. They disappear on the train to Branch Avenue, no warning or goodbye. They come back, months later, for your coworker\u2019s wedding. For your sister\u2019s awful potluck. For your uncle\u2019s funeral. Stupid reasons and good ones, too. Sometimes they\u2019ll come back smiling, better dressed than before, the heart of the party. Confusing your friends, tipsily trashing movies that never existed.\n12.\nBut you\u2019re as likely to find them sullen, clogging your brother-in-law\u2019s toilet with paper towels two years after you thought they were gone. If you\u2019re persistent, in these moments, you might wring a real answer out of them. They might tell you it\u2019s an art, chronological graffiti. The art is in the difference, a timeline changed and measured against the original, measured against what it was going to be. Watch them wad up a paper towel and stuff it down the pipe, wet to the elbow. You might not know what to say, from here on out. Do they look a little pleased with themselves? Ask them what they changed, even if you don\u2019t expect an answer. Maybe they\u2019ll tell you: little things that add up. A burning bench, a bad joke, some scooped-up roadkill.\n13.\nIf you ask how it was supposed to be, they\u2019ll say you don\u2019t understand, that there was never one right way for the world. You\u2019re not wrong to feel wistful for things that never happened. Just keep asking how it was going to be, what would have been if another future had never come along.\nx.\nYou\u2019ll find yourself searching your apartment now and then, not sure at first what you want to find. Look on the couch, behind the shower curtain. Look in the bed, when the covers are bunched up enough that maybe someone is curled up underneath. Get up in the middle of the night and walk through each of your rooms, even if you only have two, look in the kitchen, look on the fire escape. Stand there and wish you smoked, look down at the street below, the lights in the next building. Go back inside and look at where the dishes are piling up. Stand in your living room in the dark, listen for creaking floorboards. Try to find the places that might have mattered.\nEric Gregory\u2019s stories have appeared in Lightspeed, Lady Churchill\u2019s Rosebud Wristlet, Shine from Solaris Books, Zombies: More Recent Dead from Prime Books, and elsewhere.

That\u2019s the baseline for a healthy kid, right? You\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be a bonus, what with eighteen fingers. Guess they all have to function before you count them.\nAs Deficiencies go, mine\u2019s not so bad. The Skew was a hell of a thing, and everyone on the Rim\u2019s still feeling it. I knew a guy once had a fully formed jaw down around his nuts. I only wish I was kidding. On the upside, the hinge didn\u2019t work, or it would\u2019ve been a nightmare sitting down.\nSo, yeah, I have extra digits grown out from the top of my primary knuckles. You get used to working around them, though. Makes some things tenser for me when I\u2019m elbow-deep in an engine than it does for people without them, but it only took once or twice pinching them before my reflexes amped up. And, like I said: could be worse.\n\u201cAcaja!\u201d\nCase in point: I could have a mouth that doesn\u2019t close all the way like my boss, Harvey. He literally never shuts his trap.\n\u201cAcaja, get the hell over here!\u201d\nNo matter how much I wish he would.\n\u201cYes, Harvey?\u201d I call back, loud but polite, wiping off my hands and making my way across the shop. We just got our shipment in from this month\u2019s lineup with planetside, so the place is a bit crazy. All the parts we\u2019ve been sitting on our asses waiting for are finally here. Mostly.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you working on the Beej?\u201d Harvey snaps, jabbing a fat thumb at the Billings 33-J barely peeking out from under its tarp.\n\u201cSidestep unit didn\u2019t come in on the lift.\u201d\nAt one point, that oversized cannonball was top of the line in inter-roid transport, but too many close calls with a faulty sidestep unit wound up crushing two of the starboard thrusters. Nearly took out the pilot.\nThere\u2019s probably a half-dozen folks around who are sad it didn\u2019t. The wait list to be on jumper crews could wrap two times around the Rim, seems like. I used to be stupid enough to be on it.\n\u201cWhat do you mean it didn\u2019t come in?\u201d Harvey barks, flipping through his manifest. He slurps a little to keep the drool from leaking out from his oversized jaw.\n\u201cA little slower, just because I like you, Harv,\u201d I answer, moving my hands in a phony sign language as I say, \u201cDid. Not. Come. In.\u201d\n\u201cYou do know what it is, Ace?\u201d Harv sneers back.\nI sigh and walk over to the Beej. \u201cIntegrated radar and limited AI,\u201d I say, popping open the front panel. \u201cGoes home here, ties into the thruster arrays,\u201d I add, gesturing to the ports all along the surface of the jump ship.\n\u201cNo, what it is, is the most expensive piece of tech anyone on this entire roid\u2019s even breathed near,\u201d Harv growls.\n\u201cAtmocite converter core probably gives it a run for its money,\u201d I counter, leaning up against the Beej. \u201cI mean, thing turns rock into air, it\u2019s gotta be tougher to make than\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFor the love of . . . without a sidestep, this?\u201d Harv pounds on the glossy metallic shell, \u201cMight as well roll right into the scrapyard!\u201d\n\u201cHarv? Think we\u2019ve established I\u2019m aware,\u201d I snipe back. \u201cAren\u2019t any pilots on jump rotation can dodge the rock coming at them from every whichway all on their own.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. And we\u2019ve been sitting on this thing for a lift cycle and a half.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, I want that thing more than anybody. I could totally use the space for about half a dozen other repairs I can get done with what we actually have.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s right the hell here on the manifest!\u201d Harv screams, pointing.\n\u201cWell, if you can turn the words on your screen into a part, then we\u2019re all set. If you can\u2019t, then you need to talk to someone planetside, because I\u2019m telling you: no sidestep unit.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know that I can really blame Harv for being so upset. Sidestep unit\u2019s pretty much the key to the whole shebang for a jumper. Which is why I stole the thing in the first place.\n* * *\nRixzah is fine as far as roids go, I guess. But when the world\u2019s the size of an asteroid, it doesn\u2019t take long before you want to find another one. And kids\u2019ll dream their days away wondering what that might be like if you let them.\nThose kids born without any surface signs of Skew can fill their heads imagining a planet full of plants and clouds and rainbows and whatever else they have down planetside. And when they\u2019re old enough, they might even test clean and get to see that.\nBut for a little girl with extra parts out where everyone could always see them, there wasn\u2019t any kind of hope for that. Didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t dream, just meant it was a different kind. So, I sat in my room, teaching myself how to braid my hair without catching my spare digits in it. And watching spacefarer vids.\nHanson Reag was my favorite. Any time my folks managed to snag one from a skimmer, I ate that stuff up. Hanson Reag and the Particle Planet. Hanson Reag and the River Ring. Hanson Reag and the Amazon Atoll. Hanson\u2019s writers liked alliteration.\nOr maybe they just liked a lot of the same, because if I\u2019m being honest, those vids weren\u2019t exactly new each time around. Hanson would always start out in some kind of trouble from an adventure you hadn\u2019t seen, but that you knew was probably all sorts of fantastic. And then he\u2019d hide or get lost or malfunction his way onto the new planet. There was the local nice guy who wanted to help Hanson, and the local authority that thought he had the wrong look about him. Sometimes that was more literal than others; the Insect Insiders figured they shouldn\u2019t trust anyone without antennae and compound eyes. The Viridian Void\u2019s leader thought someone without green skin just looked sickly.\nBut Hanson always found a way to charm his way into their good graces, manage to find out just what was Secretly Going Wrong, and land himself a woman. Didn\u2019t matter where the hell he wound up, Hanson found some curvy piece of ass who fell into his arms at one point or another. Sometimes she turned him down flat when they met. Sometimes she swooned at the sight of him. But there was always some place, usually in the middle of the third-act chase scene or gun battle, definitely before the nasty authority figure met his poetic demise, when Hanson and his woman-shaped alien locked lips. And I\u2019ll tell you, I didn\u2019t mind that part at all. It was one more reason I wanted to be just like Hanson.\nI\u2019d curl up under my thin sheet, sucking on a tasteless vita-stick, and watch my vid-player with its hairline crack across the left side. Over and over and over again I watched until I had it memorized, and then I\u2019d play it over and over again in my head. Only, maybe Hanson was tanned more, and maybe he was a girl, and maybe she had a long, thick braid, and maybe her name started with an A.\nOf course it was all a bunch of crap. But even with the Rim making it impossible to send a ship between planets, I guess those folks planetside had some of the same dreams, \u2019cause Hanson and the guys like him were always landing somewhere new.\nThe closest real thing a girl like me could hope for was making it onto a jump crew. There weren\u2019t aliens out there, but there were other roids, and those folks crazy enough to push a sleek bit of metal through the always-shifting maze of rock between one Skew colony roid and another were even brassier explorers than Reag.\n\u201cDaaamit,\u201d Harv grouses, running his meaty fingers through hair that looks like he used the same lubricant we keep for lift joists. I look around the shop, where everyone else has his or her head planted firm in an engine or a servo unit or whatever other big block of metal and plastic keeps them from having to make eye contact with Harv. Me, I\u2019m stuck here till he lets me go. Isn\u2019t a single bit of metal to hide my eyes in, so I just start wiping my hands again, slow and careful and not looking him in his slack-jawed face.\nDoesn\u2019t really help, since his eyes land right on me again eventually, and he frowns. His version of a frown, anyway, which looks a little like he\u2019s ready to hock up a hairball.\n\u201cAnd how long were you gonna screw around tightening bolts on that low-end backup hauler before you grew a set and told me, Ace?\u201d he says. I shrug.\n\u201cOughta trash all your damn credits for the week,\u201d he growls. \u201cNothing but trouble outta you, I swear. All high minded and trained up and nothing but. . . .\u201d The rest of it flies off into something between a moan and a howl as he punches the air above his head for a minute.\n\u201cI got more important throats to rip out,\u201d he says when he remembers what words are. \u201cHelp Cassette on lift upgrade and stay the hell out of my way the rest of the day.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a prince, Harv,\u201d I say, trying to keep the sarcasm bright. I\u2019d get his hackles up even more if I suddenly started acting like I respected his authority. Gotta stay normal. For however normal any of us are up here.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch, Acaja,\u201d he tosses back, but he seems to be done with me for now, stomping off to his office, where some poor sod is about to have every member of his extended family threatened for the mix-up, I\u2019m sure. I stuff my rag in my back pocket and hustle over to the open lift unit, where I can hear Cass clanking around.\n* * *\nBy Green standards, I suppose the Officiant\u2019s office is corrupt, but credits and favors keep the air moving up here. We don\u2019t have a pretty arboretum to live in. We\u2019ve got a mess, and you need folks who are willing to rake the muck in order to get by.\nBribes are less about greed and more about insurance. Ours is an eat-or-be-eaten life. It\u2019s all about what you can get for yourself in the time you\u2019ve got. If the government weren\u2019t greasing the slide, we\u2019d probably have gutted each other six times over by now.\nNot that I knew that when I was younger. Most of us Defs are sterile; few who manage to reproduce, then, get a lot of perks. Folks who shoot out a kid who doesn\u2019t show clear signs of the Skew can manage even more. Which is, of course, why my parents were so disappointed when they saw my hands. Still, there was a chance I might be fertile, so we got a bit of extra comfort. And my parents used that to help shield me from the way the rest of the roid worked. At least for a while.\nI had no idea just how much it cost my parents to get that half-working vid player, or how many favors and credits each skimmed copy of a spacefarer adventure cost them. I thought good people got good things. Sometimes there were obstacles, but if you were just bold enough, you always ended on a high note, like Hanson.\nSo I burned even more of their credits getting all the training vids to be a jump pilot. Braided my credential medals into the crazy-thick rope of hair I\u2019d grown\u2014I didn\u2019t even have to look to keep my spares out of the tangle by then. I ran reaction sims in my head when I couldn\u2019t log into the network. Worked my body for the rigors of travel. Ate as well as we could afford. I signed up for the jumper list when I was old enough, and waited for my turn.\nKept right on waiting. See, having me gave my parents some perks, but those weren\u2019t near enough to move me up the list. Which, the way things work on the Rim, basically meant I just slowly moved down the list as people with the credits or clout pushed ahead of me.\nThere wasn\u2019t quite so big a blockade around jumper maintenance, at least. It\u2019s a gig a lot of folks still want, mind you, but no one ever made adventure epics about intrepid grease monkeys going nowhere but from one end of the shop to another. I went through all the maintenance training in hopes of making myself a more well-rounded jumper candidate, before I realized qualifications weren\u2019t what anyone running that program was looking for. Between my maintenance certs and having gotten better than average with my weird hands, though, I got in the doors, at least. Got to run all eighteen digits along the smooth surface of jump ships and lift rockets.\nBut I wasn\u2019t ever going to fly one. Not just sitting around, anyway.\n\u201cThat was a fun bit of strafing, now wasn\u2019t it?\u201d comes Cass\u2019s mellow bass echoing through the open chassis.\n\u201cOh, that?\u201d I brush off. \u201cThat was barely a ding.\u201d\nCass laughs, his dark, calloused hands hooking the outside of the engine he\u2019s been in and sliding him and his sled out.\n\u201cSomeday you are going to hit the wrong nerve on that one,\u201d he says, shaking his shaved head as he slides himself onto his chair and taps the button to lower himself back down.\nCass is probably the only person here can give me a run for my cred when it comes to maintenance. Probably why he\u2019s the only one around here ever earns a real smile out of me. Usually by flashing his own bright one first.\nHe wipes his hands off and swivels the chair, cocking his head to one side.\n\u201cLast time I saw you like this, you were all worked up \u2019cause you lost contact with that cyber-lay of yours,\u201d Cass says.\n\u201cAw, you\u2019re such a romantic,\u201d I answer, trying to convince my heart that it needs to stay right where it is. The beating on the inside of my rib cage tells me it doesn\u2019t quite buy what I\u2019m selling. Cass just shakes his head and waits.\n\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d I finally mutter.\n\u201cAlways is,\u201d Cass says with a wink. \u201cSo, you hand me the spanner and we\u2019ll work on something simple, like upgrading geo-synch ascension protocols and reworking emergency oxygen sensors.\u201d\nHe raises one black eyebrow, and I can\u2019t help but chuckle as I dig up the spanner.\nCass has a knack for sussing out what\u2019s wrong, and not just with machines. He\u2019s been fixing those since he replaced the motor on his chair at twelve years old, but despite the look of him\u2014all broad shoulders and muscles from the waist up, where you can\u2019t see what the Skew shriveled\u2014the man\u2019s got a light touch when it\u2019s called for.\nThe day I lost my transmit link with Heady, I\u2019d been exhausted and hyperagitated all morning. Nearly fried the circuits on a hydro pump. Cass pulled me aside, listened to me whine about this girl on another roid whom I\u2019d never even seen, but whom I just had to talk to again. Must have been pathetic.\n\u201cDo me a favor and pitch this, would you?\u201d he said, holding out a contact chip when I\u2019d finished grousing. \u201cSome asshat wanting to sell me skimmer gear. Like I need that kind of headache, you know?\u201d\nI stood there a second as he held the chip, and couldn\u2019t quite manage words. Then he sighed, a heavy thing coming from that barrel chest of his. He opened my hand, turned it palm up, shoved the chip in, and wrapped my hand closed around it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing can get a body in trouble, you know?\u201d he said, one thick eyebrow arching up, and I caught the glint in his clear, brown eyes. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t even toss it here. Maybe take it out by the strip, over in the slate quarter.\u201d\nI looked back down at my hand, with one set of fingers held tight, the other swaying up and down slightly. I looked back up at him and smiled. He spun his chair away and motored over to salvage the hydro pump before I could even thank him. For more than one thing; Cass\u2019s skimmer contact is how I first got practice sneaking parts across town. Skimmers don\u2019t want creds. They can get those with barely a few minutes in the hypernet. They need tech.\nProbably why the scrapyard sticks around to begin with. Space is at a premium, so you\u2019d think a sprawl of old parts wouldn\u2019t rate. But there\u2019s only so far behind we can lag before no one planetside makes what we need. At that point, it\u2019s shell out credit most of us don\u2019t have for the newer models, or find a way to keep it running with what\u2019s lying about.\nI guess I owe it to whatever part of me had given over to the doubt, since it meant I was still working off shifts doing inventory at the scrapyard despite the maintenance gig. Which also meant doing security, but it only took a couple of times showing the looters the wiry girl isn\u2019t worth messing with. You\u2019d be surprised what whipping a guy in the face with a braid full of credential medals can do to earn you a rep.\nMost nights, it was just me and the scrap. Good thing about scrap, unlike a lot of other garbage, is that old parts don\u2019t tend to smell much different than new ones. Some more oil wafting around, that little bite of rust in the air, but nothing organic. Parts decay, eventually, but more slowly, and they never go rotten.\nOver a week, I scammed three power conversion units and a quintet of prismatic optics out of the scrapyard for Cass\u2019s skimmer contact, and at the end of it all, I could talk to Heady again.\nI was afraid I said something to upset you, she typed.\nHell, no. Damn unit fried, and I only had that one by accident. I thought I might never talk to you again.\nType.\nHeh. Yeah, type.\nI\u2019d love to talk, though, came the characters, and I groaned into the night, setting the straps creaking in the makeshift hammock-lounger I built with cables and pipes, deep back in the maze of scrap where even personnel aren\u2019t keen on schlepping. Maybe when you finally get onto a jumper crew.\nYeah, sure, I typed back, my eyes drifting to the jumper husk in the far alcove. I can\u2019t be on the bottom of the list forever, right?\nThat\u2019s the way, she typed, and right then I was so very glad I hadn\u2019t been able to find the subcortical node the skimmer wanted as trade for a vid unit. Much as I wanted to see Heady, I didn\u2019t want her to see me right then. I was never going to have the creds or connections to push myself up the list. I was about as likely to take a trip between roids as that stupid, burned out jumper shell.\n* * *\nI haven\u2019t had a day drag so long as this one in, honestly, ever. But somehow, I get through Cass\u2019s sidelong glances and Harv\u2019s growling and even a stint spent scrubbing old thruster housings, and finally\u2014finally\u2014I can clock out.\n\u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d I hear Harv bellowing as my fingers are reaching for the exit. I swear under my breath.\n\u201cGo,\u201d Cass says, waving at the door while he spins his chair back toward the shop. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him he just missed you.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a tank,\u201d Cass says, patting the arm of his chair. \u201cHarv can\u2019t do anything to me. And you got whatever it is with that girl of yours to work out.\u201d\nI turn over in my head whether it\u2019ll be more suspicious if I stay and take Harv\u2019s tantrum. Any other day, though, I\u2019d flip him double birds and walk at the end of my shift.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a prince, Cass,\u201d I say, and scramble outside.\n\u201cI\u2019m the whole royal family, sweetheart,\u201d I hear him say as the door slips shut.\nI shove my hands in my jacket pockets to keep anyone from seeing them shake. Keep my eyes down, which isn\u2019t really out of character; never know who\u2019s going to decide to take offense from eye contact and decide you\u2019re staring at their scaly skin or head fin or missing joints.\nI grunt at security and scan my badge, hustle off into the crowd of after-work Defs who are all just trying to get the hell home. They want their little boxes, vaguely edible rations, and maybe a shoddy vid unit if they\u2019re lucky. A good night here is getting away from all the other folks who are just a big, ugly reminder of how broken we all are. Or getting smash drunk and managing to blur them all out of your head. Maybe both.\nMe, I\u2019ve got a bunk and most of my stuff in a back room of the scrapyard office to get to. I do the crowd-bumping dance, throw enough attitude that I don\u2019t have to stop and deal with anyone who gets a nose or lack-of-nose out of whack from the jostling.\nI give a dead-handed wave to the day staff leaving the scrapyard. Tap in for the night. Drum my fingers on the desk just long enough to make sure no one\u2019s coming back for something he forgot. Then I practically bounce to the back of the office to grab my transmit unit.\nFinally got the sidestep, I type.\nThat\u2019s amazing! comes the response onscreen, and I try to ignore the warmth in my cheeks. How long before you think you can get it installed?\nMaybe half an hour? I type back. Between extracting the old one and running the testing routine to make sure the new one\u2019s up to snuff. The intercept light on the unit flashes orange and I sigh.\nThey\u2019re doing a sweep, I read before I have time to type it myself. Contact again when you\u2019re here. I can\u2019t wait!\nI tap the power off on the unit. I trust Cass\u2019s skimmer well enough, but it\u2019s been a good year now, and the Greens planetside have a lot more resources than we do. I don\u2019t want to test out whether his hack holds up to mask my location. The last thing I need right now is some hypernet bot frying my only way to keep in touch with Heady.\nI fall back on the lumpy pallet in my little room when I feel that warmth in my cheeks again. I\u2019ve never even seen her. But she\u2019s been a lifeline for so long, I just. . . .\nYeah. So I guess there\u2019s still a little dreamer in me after all this time.\nHonestly, there\u2019d have to be for me to be trying to pull this job off in the first place. Harv isn\u2019t just the maintenance supervisor. No one that high up is \u201cjust\u201d in any of the senses of the word. Like making it onto a jumper crew, you make it to being in charge by pulling the right strings and doing the right favors for the right people.\nThat the right people are usually doing what the Greens would call wrong is just the way it works up here.\nWhen there\u2019s almost no good source for quality local tech, it only makes sense that you\u2019d have someone in Harv\u2019s position to facilitate acquisitions. The high-end stuff\u2014like the sidestep\u2014takes a lot of sweet-talking and finagling. Most of the rest, though: given how old just about everything we work with is, it doesn\u2019t really faze the order takers planetside when Harv puts in for extras. If sending up cheap, mass-produced tech keeps us out of their atmosphere, I expect the Greens are happy to shuttle it up in whatever quantities get ordered. At least for as long as they\u2019re still making it.\nIt takes me all of five minutes to gather the last of my gear in my knapsack. Then I key in the code logging me for a patrol and slide out into the scrap stacks.\nSure it\u2019s my job, but I actually like walking back through the maze of metal and plastic, especially when I\u2019m agitated. Piles of gears and tires and windscreens and circuits and . . . yeah. Everything we ever made that lasted, that got better? It\u2019s here. Not exactly broken, but not exactly the best, either. There\u2019s the pile of rudders from the obsolete surveillance bots. Two more twists to the left, and I\u2019m in the containers of switches. Every modality someone might want to alter, we\u2019ve managed to make toggles, flip bits, or knobs for it.\nI like running the tips of my real fingers over the monitors. Some of them are hard as metal, others bend with a touch. We sort them by size in the yard, so I can slide my touch over all the cycles, from when we needed to see everything at the size of our room walls until pictures burned into the back of our eyes, to when we needed to have it locked on our wrists despite the squinting. Every size for your artificial-viewing needs.\nRight around here\u2014a switchback and a half or so\u2014is where folks generally lose interest. No one wants to be hauling parts from this far back in the yard. By design and out of habit, the parts start falling into true graveyard categories by now. I can\u2019t really remember the last time anyone asked for outmoded cable pulls for a mobile crusher unit, for example, so they all hang like some kind of rubberized vineyard along the wall I\u2019m passing. We could probably fully trash them, but staff isn\u2019t any more inclined to haul a mess of old parts from this far back as any citizen is.\nMakes it the perfect place for my little assembly lab. It started out as practice for my maintenance certs. Nobody may want them, but the fact is, once I was able to reassemble some outdated engines, the easy-make variety we have now wound up giving me no trouble at all. At the end of the day, I also wound up with a clunky but rideable floater bike. I only really take it out for rides in the rock desert behind the yard, though. Greens banned the things for exhaust violation ages ago.\nI pat the old girl when I see her again, then flop my knapsack on the top of my old screener. You see, after the bike, I got nostalgic for that vid-player from when I was a kid. Took a bit longer on that one, but eventually I had a full-sized version, not the little portable model I remembered. I did manage to find a screen with a crack in exactly the same place, though. Set it all up in the empty front-end shell of an atmocite trawler. So, when I got to wanting a distraction but didn\u2019t feel like taking the bike out, I\u2019d load up some old Hanson Reags into the player, lean back on the creaky cables, and pretend I was that stupid kid under the covers again.\nThat\u2019s how I first picked up Heady\u2019s signal. I wasn\u2019t as good with the vid tech, so while I was swapping a burned-out board one night, trying to figure out which one could actually decode my old vid files, one of them turned out to be a half-working transmit board.\nCome on you piece of shit and work, I typed into the console. Yeah, it was late. I was annoyed. I didn\u2019t think I was doing anything other than getting out my frustration.\nHello? Do I know you?\nSo, not as dashing a first meet as Hanson, but Heady\u2019s got a sense of humor, so we moved past it pretty quickly, and I stopped looking for the vid conversion card. Instead, when I came back to take a break, I\u2019d type with Heady, instead. Weren\u2019t any pictures, but I had plenty of old Hanson Reag stored up in my head, so it worked out all right.\nWe had a lot in common, turns out. She was bright as I was, though Heady\u2019s skills were more medical.\nI\u2019ve never been very good with people, I told her.\nYou seem to be doing all right now.\nCharmer.\nBack at you.\nHeady kept me from freaking out whenever I was waiting on new cert results. I told her about all my tinkering. She told me about her stumper cases and her stroke-of-luck saves. We both vented about our hard-nosed supervisors. Heady was the first person I told about landing the job in maintenance.\nSo, I guess we won\u2019t be able to chat as often?\nAll right, so maybe I didn\u2019t keep the scrapyard job entirely out of pessimism.\nThat transmit unit didn\u2019t last too long. Outdated tech, poorly maintained by me? It was bound to fry from a scrambler signal eventually. That was a night: me ripping through the boards, trying to match another up to the one I had, which was fused and melted so it wasn\u2019t exactly a pristine template, now was it?\nI never did find another board in the scrapyard, but in all my running around, digging for things, I found the jumper husk\u2014another Beej. Hooked up the floater bike and half-careened that thing back to my tinkering arena. There was a pattern of micrometeorite burn along the starboard curve. A huge dent in the aft from some other collision, surrounded by a radiating patina of tarnish and oxidization. But, all things considered? It looked like a jumper.\nI look up at her now. I slide my false fingers along the places where I sealed up the micro breaches. There\u2019s still rusty streaks from where they were, but the surface is intact now. The dent\u2019s been bumped back out for a while, though I left the radiating patina. I thought it gave her character. I unzip my jacket and pull the new sidestep unit from my inner pocket. I hold up the cylinder to the front assembly armor plating.\n\u201cYou see that, Little Beater?\u201d I say, turning that stupid-small rod of transparent steel and circuitry in my hand with a grin so large it makes my cheeks ache. \u201cTonight, we\u2019re fixing you up for good.\u201d\nI point upward, patting Little Beater\u2019s shell and getting a hollow, echoing thunk that makes my stomach jump a bit.\n\u201cThen you and me are off to rescue the princess.\u201d\nI know the creaking sounds are just the frame settling, but part of me likes to think it\u2019s the ship smiling big as me at the thought of doing what she was born to do. I pat her hull a little softer this time, watch the stars and bits of rock at play in the night above us a minute. Then I open her up and get to work.\n* * *\nLittle by little, telling myself it was just a hobby, just something to keep my hands from going idle, I managed to cobble together what was missing in the jumper. Then, in a stray fit of insanity, I told Heady.\nYou *built* a jump ship?\nReconstructed. It\u2019s not nearly as hard. Replaced the fuel lines. Reshopped gears. Soldered loose connections.\nNone of that sounds easy.\nIt\u2019s not all exactly up to code, mind.\nThere are codes for bringing a jump ship back from the dead?\nHa ha. Well, like: I converted a geo-positioner into a route calculator. Replaced a few lost guidance fins with parts from the scrapyard\u2019s rudder pile. Cobbled two flex screens and the castoffs of an old armored crowd control unit into a working front end\/navigation display.\nBut that\u2019s. . . . Okay, that\u2019s just amazing.\nIt\u2019s still not much better than decoration.\nWell, I still think it\u2019s amazing. And look at how much you found already that you never thought you would? You\u2019re bound to find the rest sometime soon.\nIs everyone on your roid such a crazy optimist? I typed, though I could feel the twitch from the smile I was trying to hide, even though she couldn\u2019t see it anyway.\nI\u2019m one of a kind, she answered.\nIndeed.\nAnd then that other Beej landed in our shop, and I had a sidestep. It was busted, sure. It couldn\u2019t engage autoevasion, but it would complete the thruster control panel by bridging its connection to the collision sensors. I lodged the unit in, strapped myself down. I probably sat in that seat a good fifteen minutes, staring at the control panels and the monitors. Finally, I initiated the test sequence.\nI\u2019m pretty sure I screamed louder than the engines when she lifted ten feet up and spun me onto my head. I reversed the controls and set her down in a hurry. There were always loud noises from one corner or another on Rixzah, but I didn\u2019t need too much attention.\nThat was nearly it. It could actually work. Some stupid, hare-brained scheme that made about as much sense as something Reag would come up with, and I was just one overpriced piece of tech away from having it work.\nI\u2019ve been turning that stupid little tube of half-working tech in my hand for a good ten minutes now, ever since I yanked it out of the bridging panel to replace it. It\u2019s about the size and shape of the handlebars on my floater bike. Wrapped half in conductive metals, half in transparent plastics where it needs to let the laser relays through. It all comes to a point on one end, which is covered in the fine circuit mesh that translates the sensor warnings into thruster commands. I hold it up next to the pristine, new unit, and sure, the new one shines better, but damned if they aren\u2019t both ridiculous feats of engineering.\n\u201cThink you forgot to return some equipment to the job site, Ace,\u201d comes a voice from behind me.\nHarv. Dammit.\n\u201cWhat, this?\u201d I ask, holding the old sidestep over my head as I slide the new one behind the ridge in the open panel. \u201cHarv, this thing doesn\u2019t work. You can\u2019t refurb sidesteps. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d give a\u2014?\u201d\nI\u2019ve turned around now, and the gun in his hand says this is probably a whole lot deeper hole I\u2019ve dug myself than I would have thought.\n\u201cI know you think I\u2019m a moron, girl,\u201d Harv says. \u201cYou think \u2019cause you can make just about anything run, that makes you better than me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say? I was born with the right hands for the job,\u201d I quip, though my throat\u2019s threatening to close up. I slip the old sidestep unit into my jacket and slowly raise my hands.\n\u201cDo I look like I want to take any shit from you, girl?\u201d Harv says. Most people would be gritting their teeth right now, but, well: Harv. \u201cI already had to screw around with Cassette covering for your ass.\u201d\nMy throat really does close up for a second. I have to cough to make the words come out.\n\u201cIs Cass all right? He didn\u2019t have anything to do with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI told you I\u2019m not a moron, bitch,\u201d Harv growls. \u201cI did not get where I am by being stupid. I did not get where I am by buying what the rabble is selling. And I will not lose what I have because two little shits\u2014 who read too many manuals and never got their hands dirty\u2014have it in their heads they deserve a reward.\u201d\n\u201cMy hands are in engines every day, Harv. They\u2019re plenty dirty,\u201d I counter.\n\u201cNot the right kind,\u201d he says. He brings the gun up, sighting along the top, balances it with his other hand, and steps closer. I\u2019m trying not to show it, but the certs in my braid jangle from my shaking.\n\u201cI lose that unit, I lose everything,\u201d Harv says, slowly closing on me. I see the sweat dripping down from his temples, and it clicks.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t told anyone.\u201d\n\u201cJust hand it over, and no one needs to know,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou spent the day tracking it, seeing whose screwup it was, and when you figured out the trail was solid all the way up, you realized it was gonna land on you.\u201d\nHarv doesn\u2019t say anything, but he\u2019s close enough now that I can hear the energy converter on the gun humming.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt Cass,\u201d I say, and I feel one of the knots in my stomach let go. \u201c\u2019Cause if you did, you\u2019d need someone to clean it up, and you\u2019d have to tell them why you hurt him, and you couldn\u2019t do any of that until you had the sidestep back.\u201d\n\u201cAbout to get it back now, though, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he says, his gaping smile broken up in the middle by the crystal lens at the end of the gun barrel. One little finger twitch, and there would be a big, burning hole in the center of my chest. He can\u2019t miss, given how close he\u2019s gotten.\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t have to be careful not to hurt anyone else, do I?\u201d he says. \u201cThat stupid, self-important braid full of certs ain\u2019t nothing to brag about now, is it?\u201d\nHis smile falters when he sees mine creep into place.\n\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d he asks.\nThat\u2019s when I swing my head down and knock his hands aside with my credential-heavy braid.\n\u201cStill think the braid might be something to brag about,\u201d I say as I close the distance and smash my elbow into the hand still holding the gun. It falls to the ground, and I kick it out of the way.\nSurprise only lasts so long, though. It\u2019s clear pretty fast that Harv wasn\u2019t blowing smoke about getting his hands dirty. I know how to fight, but he\u2019s definitely got more practice. And about fifty pounds of muscle on me. He\u2019ll be bruised tomorrow, but I\u2019m pretty sure the shooting pain in my chest means I\u2019ve got at least a couple broken ribs. Makes it hard to catch my breath, and when I take the half-second to wipe the blood away from my right eye before I lose the use of it, Harv lands another haymaker. Pain shoots up my back as my spine smashes hard into the ridge of the open panel on the jumper.\n\u201cGive me the unit,\u201d Harv growls, stomping toward me.\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d I scream, holding up one hand as I reach with the other down to where I slid the new sidestep.\n\u201cThatta girl,\u201d he says. \u201cHand it over, and everything gets fixed.\u201d\nHe looms over me, and that gaping, blood-coated smile tells me he\u2019s going to kill me. Once he has the sidestep, he\u2019s going to kill me, and then he\u2019s going to kill Cass. If he finds the transmit, he\u2019ll probably send people after Heady, too.\nI wrap my hand around the smooth cylinder of the new sidestep, and all I can think is, I hate you, Hanson Reag.\nI rush forward with as much force as I have left, slamming my body into Harv\u2019s chest. It\u2019s not enough to knock him over, but keeping on his feet takes him just enough time for me to swing my arm up and shove the pointed end of the sidestep straight into the soft spot behind Harv\u2019s chin.\nHe chokes out something, but given that he\u2019s got metal skewered up through his tongue, it\u2019s probably nothing I was ever going to understand. Harv staggers backward, clutching for the bit of the cylinder still sticking out below his chin. While he\u2019s trying to get ahold and pull it out, I manage one breath, find my balance, then whip my braid around his neck.\nI jump up, wrapping my legs around his waist from behind. Grab hold of the braid with all eighteen digits and pull. Harv lurches left, then right, and my credentials jangle as he gargle-moans something.\nMy grip almost falters from the jolt through my body as we fall to the ground, but I hold on. I hold on as he rolls on top of me. Hold on as he flails and gurgles out more insults. Hold on as I hear something loud and wet crack and don\u2019t know which of us it is. Hold on until the last, ugly rattle, and for at least a minute after Harv stops moving.\nIt takes some time before I can finagle my knees enough to get leverage and roll Harv off of me. I take a second and a few, painful breaths, then I look.\nTurns out the wet cracking was Harv. For the first time in his life, his jaw is completely closed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I croak as I grit my teeth and twist the sidestep out of him. I know before I look: the thing\u2019s trash. One of the optic ports is cracked, and the circuit mesh is pretty much circuit mush now.\nI drop it on the ground and push myself to my feet. A few unsteady steps get me back to the open side port, and I pull the old sidestep out of my jacket. This one\u2019s still intact. At least, as intact as it ever was. The thrusters would fire. The collision alerts would sound. But there\u2019s no functional AI to connect the two. Just a Deficient I.\nI look up at the debris field lying between me and Heady, the smooth metal of the cylinder sliding across my fingers as I twirl it on instinct. Might as well be explosive mines. I close my eyes a second and shake my head, credentials clattering in the quiet.\nThe old sidestep slides in place and I twist it secure, latch the panel back down. I limp my way inside. Latch myself in the control chair with a wince as the straps pinch one of my broken ribs. Initiate the startup sequence.\nHarv\u2019s right. You don\u2019t get on a jumper crew by acing the training, setting reaction records, and knowing the control board like the back of your disfigured hand. The schlubs who ride these things need the ship to do the driving for them, because they spent too much time working the system to get into this seat and not enough figuring out what they could do once they were in it.\nBut that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been thinking about, all I\u2019ve been training to do, since I was staring at a cracked vid-player screen under a thin, cheap sheet. Well, that, and one other thing. The thrusters rumble to life with the sensor displays, and the busted metal husk I\u2019ve been rebuilding and filling with dreams I never had the right to lifts off.\nIt\u2019s time to go kiss the girl.\nJason Kimble left the tornadoes of Michigan for the hurricanes of Florida, because spinning air is better when it\u2019s warm.

Place has nothing to do with the story, or almost nothing, since it started by a lake where a mechanic was fishing off the dock. We can say it was Lake Erie if that makes you happy, but the important thing is that he caught a fish, a nondescript fish that looked much like a walleye, except this fish could talk, which is not common among walleye, except for the most learned ones. This fish was also magical, which no walleye are to the best of my knowledge.\n\u201cI will give you three wishes if you let me go,\u201d said the fish that was not a walleye, and this is where we get to important stuff, so you should pay attention if you weren\u2019t before.\nThe mechanic figured that wishes were better than fishes, especially since he didn\u2019t like walleye much, so he asked for a new motorboat so he wouldn\u2019t have fish off the dock, and a plastic grocery bag with a jar of peanut butter that would never be empty and a loaf of bread that would never get moldy or run out, and he wanted his son to go into the mechanic business since the boy was a layabout who\u2019d be content to deliver pizzas and play video games forever.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do the last one,\u201d said the fish. \u201cWould you like a motorcycle instead?\u201d\n\u201cBut he gets up at two in the afternoon, lies around until five, and eats all the potato chips when I\u2019m at work,\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cI need him to have ambition.\u201d\n\u201cNo can do,\u201d said the fish, shaking his head sadly before the man cut it off, deciding that he was hungry enough to eat walleye after all. Thinking about his son made him grouchy. He took the fish home, deboned it, fried the filets, and had awful indigestion all night, reminding him why he didn\u2019t eat walleye often.\nThe stranger thing happened the next day, when the mechanic started to have odd compulsions. When a customer had him cornered in the mechanic\u2019s shop, lost in an argument about prices or parts, the mechanic had to offer him three wishes so the customer would let him get back to work. He did not like or understand the phenomenon, only knew that if he didn\u2019t offer the wishes he\u2019d start to get an awful stomachache, and it didn\u2019t put him in a good mood. He wanted to work on cars, and didn\u2019t enjoy talking to people for extended periods of time.\n\u201cYou grant wishes?\u201d said one of his customers, who\u2019d been arguing over the price of a transmission rebuild. \u201cFuck that.\u201d\n\u201cJust try me,\u201d said the mechanic, who wanted the man out of his shop.\n\u201cRed sports car,\u201d he said, \u201cyou choose the make and the model.\u201d\nThe mechanic didn\u2019t know how the sports car appeared in the lot beside his garage, but his customer looked like he\u2019d shit his pants, which the mechanic found gratifying in a sour way that made him smirk for the rest of the morning.\nThe mechanic had a peanut butter sandwich for lunch. His son was still a lout, but the mechanic had moved him to the basement where there was a couch and TV, so he didn\u2019t have to see his offspring quite as much. You might say he should have thought of that before, and I would agree with you and go further as to say the boy should have found his own apartment, but that didn\u2019t do much to solve the mechanic\u2019s more pressing problem. This wish-granting issue was annoying. He wondered if there was a fish bone caught in his throat and the instinct would pass like a disease if he dislodged it, but a month went by, then two, then three, and he was still a reluctant magician. None of his clients believed he could fulfill wishes, but perhaps it had to do with the mechanic\u2019s delivery.\nHe crossed his arms when the genie urge struck him and said, \u201cOkay, so I\u2019ve got to give you three wishes. What do you want, anyway, and hurry it up because I haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d\nActually he did have all day, he had as long as it took, but he didn\u2019t want the people who got wishes to know that. A lot of them wished for dumb stuff regardless of time limits, so he didn\u2019t think it mattered. He\u2019d wished for practical things, like the never-ending jar of peanut butter and bag of bread, which showed a little forethought, but once he could grant wishes to anyone, he lost his small amount of respect for the human race. I don\u2019t have time to tell you all the silly things people wished for, the story is too short for that, so you must use your imagination, but I trust that will suffice. The mechanic decided all the people he granted wishes to were crazy or dumb as a post. Sometimes both. He gave them cars and winning lottery tickets and got them the hell out of his garage so he could return to the engine rebuild.\nThe mechanic couldn\u2019t tell people what to wish for, but he could give them directed guidance, like the young man who had just opened his own garage and tried to wheedle the mechanic down on the price of a used station wagon he wanted to sell. He wanted four grand for the car, and the young man would only give him three, and before long the mechanic found himself in a corner of the garage by the register, and the young man was irritated since he was low on funds.\nYou\u2019d think the mechanic would have learned to avoid arguments by this time, but he hadn\u2019t, so wishes had to be offered.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said the young man. \u201cThen I want the car for free.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s dumb,\u201d said the mechanic, \u201cbut whatever, it\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d said the young man.\n\u201cOne wish down, two to go,\u201d said the mechanic.\n\u201cThen I want a ring for my girlfriend,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d said the mechanic. I make no excuse for his lack of tact. It had never been one of his strong points. \u201cWhat you need are improvements to your shop.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want to get married, and rings are expensive,\u201d said the young man.\nThe mechanic sighed. He was bound to this kid until he made all his wishes, but in this case he could devote a little extra time to the project. It was for a good cause.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple logic,\u201d he said, \u201cgive a man a ring and he\u2019ll get a wife. Show a man how to build a great mechanic shop, and he\u2019ll be able to buy a shitload of jewelry for his wife in the future and not need any damn genie.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a genie,\u201d said the young man.\n\u201cDo you think I fucking care about that?\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m shutting down for the day. We\u2019re going to your garage.\u201d\nThey drove there in the old station wagon. The older mechanic advised the younger one that he needed better tools, and once those were wished for he had to teach the young man how to use them. That\u2019s why, when the young man wished for the mechanic to repair the motor on an expensive sports car, the mechanic wouldn\u2019t let him waste a wish. (This practice of wish-denial probably breaks some rule of genie-hood, but I do not claim to be an expert on the profession, so you\u2019ll have to investigate the matter for yourself.)\n\u201cYou have to learn how to do this on your own,\u201d he said, \u201cor else you\u2019ll fuck up the next job.\u201d He spent one day, then two, then three at the young man\u2019s shop, but the kid needed guidance, and the mechanic had an endless supply of peanut butter sandwiches. He could miss a few customers since he had to help the young man build a loyal customer base for the garage. Of course they worked twelve- and thirteen-hour days.\nThe young man was a good student with a careful hand\u2014the mechanic admitted his son the pizza-delivering lout would have done much worse at the profession\u2014but after a month of blood, sweat, and motor oil, the young man\u2019s girlfriend was complaining about him being at the shop until nine every night, and how she never saw him anymore.\n\u201cTough,\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re starting a business.\u201d\nI daresay this mode of thinking also explained why the mechanic was no longer married, but he had also realized this particular logic years ago, and come to the conclusion that his first love would always be his shop.\nHis passion for the profession might explain why, when the young man made his final wish, it was one the mechanic didn\u2019t expect.\n\u201cI want out of the business,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here forever trying to get the job done right so I don\u2019t piss off a customer, then my girlfriend gets pissed instead, and I just can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d said the mechanic.\n\u201cI hate worrying about rent and electricity and how much I\u2019m charging for a job and if it\u2019s more or less than other guys,\u201d said the young man.\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d said the mechanic.\n\u201cAnd customers get mad when I fix one problem and next week there\u2019s another, like that\u2019s my fault, and they don\u2019t listen when I say they should get a new car,\u201d said the young man. \u201cYou have so many good ideas, you choose a new profession for me. That\u2019s my wish. I\u2019m going home.\u201d\nThe mechanic had to follow him, still bound to the young man by a final wish he didn\u2019t want to grant, and he wasn\u2019t even sure if he could.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smart, and things will get better,\u201d he said as they drove home in the young man\u2019s station wagon. The mechanic never imagined this job would be so difficult, and he realized the fish\u2019s dilemma. He could grant things, cash and cars and endless bags of peanut butter sandwiches, but he couldn\u2019t manifest changes in people. He couldn\u2019t make them happy. Somewhere, I know, the ghost of that magic fish was smirking, but what became of him is an entirely different and yet equally engaging story we shall save for another time.\nAt the young man\u2019s house the mechanic took off his grease-stained ball cap, nodded to the frowning girlfriend, and manifested a pizza and a six-pack to apologize for the intrusion. They spent the evening watching car races, and the mechanic shut up about brakes and transmissions. He convinced the young man to come to his garage the next day, just to hang out and watch him work. And talk. He promised Chinese food for dinner, and that they would close at five for the day. He hoped to inspire the young man, but an hour of talking only made him more depressed, which explained why the mechanic had gone into auto repair instead of job counseling.\n\u201cI want to be ten years older and have a successful career and be happy,\u201d the young man said. \u201cBut you probably can\u2019t do that for me. Or you\u2019d tell me why it\u2019s a stupid idea.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stupid idea,\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just make you happy. You have to figure out how that works.\u201d\n\u201cThen what good are you?\u201d said the young man.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cI\u2019m still new at this wish thing.\u201d\n\u201cCould have fooled me,\u201d said the young man.\n\u201cI ruined your love for the profession,\u201d said the mechanic, who was becoming rather depressed himself. \u201cI pushed you too hard.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the young man. \u201cMy dad always worked for other people, and he thought being your own boss would be the best thing in the world. I was sure I wanted to do that and have my own shop, but now I want someone else to have the responsibility and just tell me what to do. Nicely. I\u2019m too stressed out and I\u2019m not even doing anything important like saving lives or kittens.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re making sure brakes and engines are functioning,\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty damn important if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d said the young man, \u201cbut I should have trained to be a firefighter. Then you know you\u2019re doing something that helps people. If your job keeps you up late at night, you have a good reason to wander around the house eating cheese crackers and being worried. It\u2019s not like worrying if you messed something up on the oil change.\u201d\n\u201cDriving a car is like driving a battering ram,\u201d said the mechanic. \u201cLives are in your hands.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d said the young man, who was texting on his cell phone, which was unwise to do in the company of genies, but the mechanic was used to being ignored by his lout of a son who was still living in the basement.\nThe mechanic closed the shop at five, materialized white boxes of Chinese takeout in the back seat of the station wagon, and tried to console the young man on the drive home.\n\u201cStarting a business is hard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to stick with it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd not go bankrupt,\u201d said the young man. \u201cMy girlfriend works at this stained glass supply store and does work on commission. It\u2019s not a lot of money, but she\u2019s got a regular paycheck. I feel like I\u2019m pretending to be an adult and someday people will figure out that I\u2019m really a six year old playing under the hood of their car and poking at wires. This friend of mine from high school is a volunteer firefighter. They have training exercises where they set buildings on fire and put them out. He could die trying to save someone\u2019s life. I could die having a car fall on me.\u201d\nThe mechanic wished for the stupid people and stupid wishes of a month and a half ago, when he\u2019d cheerfully derided and then granted dumb requests, and gotten on with his life. Did other genie types run into this problem, he wondered. The hard part wasn\u2019t the people who wanted dumb shit, it was the people who thought about what they wanted and realized his limitations.\n\u201cMaybe you can work for me,\u201d he said, \u201cin at eight, out at five. I\u2019ll worry about the lights and the electric bill and pissing off customers. You can take time off your own shop and figure out what you want to do. You\u2019ve got another wish, kid.\u201d\nMaybe the young man didn\u2019t hate cars, but he didn\u2019t want to marry a business. The mechanic could give him the paycheck he wanted, and he wouldn\u2019t have to grant wishes to anyone else for the time being. But it only took five days of working and pondering life in the mechanic\u2019s shop for the young man to decide he wanted to train to be a firefighter. He also didn\u2019t want to waste a wish on that goal, he assured the mechanic, since he needed to endure the requisite physical tests and understand more about the science of fire.\nWhen he made the announcement to his girlfriend at dinner, she was not happy.\n\u201cYou want to make a difference and I want to keep you around,\u201d she said, banging her knife on the table because the mechanic had materialized steaks and baked potatoes.\n\u201cBased on statistical rates of death in different professions,\u201d said the mechanic, \u201cfirefighting isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d The girlfriend gave him a death glare. The mechanic realized he was worse with relationship counseling than career counseling.\n\u201cWhy does he get all the wishes, and nobody\u2019s asking my opinion?\u201d said the girlfriend. \u201cIf anyone cares to know, and you probably don\u2019t, I\u2019d like two reliable cars, a good 401(k) retirement plan, and a three-bedroom house for when we have kids.\u201d\nThe mechanic nodded. Very practical. But he wasn\u2019t under her command, so all he could do was materialize a chocolate cake and sit on the couch to watch auto racing as the argument whirled around him, with words hurled at dizzying rates. In comparison, it was soothing to watch cars speed around the track over and over. The drivers didn\u2019t question their mission, and didn\u2019t worry about dying for a good or bad reason. That was why he admired them. There was no hesitation about the importance of going fast for the sake of speed, the adrenalin thrill, bringing entertainment to others who were too smart to try it themselves. He materialized another six pack of beer as the young couple bickered over who loved who more, and the wish lay on the coffee table, gleaming and forgotten.\nTeresa Milbrodt has published a short story collection, Bearded Women: Stories (ChiZine Publications); a novel, The Patron Saint of Unattractive People (Boxfire Press); and a flash fiction collection, Larissa Takes Flight: Stories (Pressgang).

There was a thing under the asphalt, and it was under the woodchips around the slide and the swings and the wooden bridge. You couldn\u2019t see it but it was really cool. It understood.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know it was cool if you couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d Lucy asked, and we ignored her. Lucy was only our second-best friend.\n\u201cWell, I had my weird dream all week,\u201d Sara Beth said, crossing her dark, skinny arms. \u201cIt laughed but I didn\u2019t know why, and I thought it was funny but then my tummy started to hurt and there were clouds and it was dark and I was scared \u2019cause I just knew.\u201d\n\u201cI had mine for a month,\u201d Lizzie Beth said. She was lying; we both know this now, but Sara Beth only suspected then. \u201cThe laugh tasted like ice cream, like right before you eat too much ice cream when you think you could eat all the ice cream in the world. The best feeling.\u201d\n\u201cIn my dream, there\u2019s a wall\u2014\u201d Lucy began, but then the bell rang, and we bolted for the classroom, leaving her behind like always because no one could run as fast as us, no one in the whole wide world.\n* * *\nFirst is the worst\nSecond is the best\nThird is the one with the treasure chest\nThat was our favorite rhyme. Before the playground rhymes broke the world, sometimes Miss Cranton would have us stay inside during our recess and be her little helpers and we would yell it at the kids racing in, or sometimes we\u2019d yell it racing in ourselves, faster then slower then faster, trying to get that second or third place.\n\u201cFirst is the worst!\u201d and we slowed down so that Anthony Michaels went tripping through the door before us, and \u201cSecond is the best!\u201d as we burst through like one body, triumphant, and \u201cThird is the one with the treasure chest!\u201d as Harry Esposito pushed Jenny Chen out of the way, and\u2014\nAnd then that perfect bang-it-out word-rhythm, the way it hit the floor and the walls and the smooth tops of the desks, would falter and fall apart.\n\u201cFourth is the one\u2014\u201d Sara Beth would start, as Tommy Jankowski came skidding in.\n\u201cIs a dwarf!\u201d Lizzie Beth would shout over her, Tommy crashing into his desk, Derek and Amy going too fast to keep from piling up against him too.\n\u201cIn the wedding dress!\u201d Sara Beth would insist, a few other kids chorusing weakly behind her.\nSara Beth would say that fourth is the one in the wedding dress was better because then girls could race for it like a good thing and if a boy got it then it was really funny. Lizzie Beth would say it was fourth is a dwarf, because the last line should rhyme the way the first line did, it sounded better. Also she\u2019d seen that hobbit movie and dwarves were cool. Sara Beth would roll her eyes and say it wasn\u2019t that kind of dwarf, it was a real person dwarf, the kind grown-ups got mad if you said dwarf or midget instead of little person, and so that rhyme was mean. Lizzie Beth would shoot back that Sara Beth was a baby.\nMiss Cranston would give us her \u2018Not This Again, Don\u2019t You Dare\u2019 look, so Lizzie Beth would glare like she could laser-beam melt Sara Beth\u2019s brain into her way of thinking, and Sara Beth would look at everything besides Lizzie Beth, just waiting until Miss Cranston brought out the math book and Lizzie Beth needed her help with addition enough to stop caring about her stupid wrong version of the rhyme.\nWe fought over that rhyme worse than we ever fought over broken Barbies or unsent birthday invitations or favorite Baby-Sitters Club books or anything. We fought over it that stupid stabbing angry-spitting way you fight with your best friend when you realize you\u2019re not the same person and never will be and it hurts like you\u2019re being torn in half, like your heart is just going to ache and bleed forever and ever.\nWe can\u2019t really fight over it anymore.\n* * *\nThe playground rhymes were waiting that day, under the asphalt and under the wood chips, and we knew it even if we didn\u2019t know it. We knew something was there, the thing from the dream, the whispers and the laughs and the wanting, the pounding against a cracking glass wall there under the dirt, there in the backs of our minds. We knew and we could taste it on our tongues, sweet like chocolate and salty like blood.\nLizzie Beth\u2019s it, had a fit, kissed a German idiot!\nIt was a crackling buttery-hot fizzy feel, like popcorn and soda pop in our stomachs while we waited for the purple velvet curtain to rise. It made us run faster, breathe harder, rubber soles slapping against the wooden bridge, the blue plastic slide, skidding on the woodchips. We ran and we lunged, leapt, stomped, jumped, shoved\u2014we burned our palms on the ropes and scraped our knees on the wood and banged our elbows against the plastic, and the burn and blood and the pain just made us grin, just made us feel like wolves with our teeth out, leaping up with our hearts pumping, rejoining the pack, bringing down the prey\u2014\nSara Beth\u2019s it, had a fit, kissed a German idiot!\nSara Beth loved the game and she loved playing it with Lizzie Beth, loved the flow of it like a back-and-forth river as you tagged a kid and a kid tagged you and you tagged your best friend in the whole wide world. Lizzie Beth loved the game, and she loved the words, the sparkle and flash and snap of them, the way her and Sara Beth\u2019s and all the other kids\u2019 voices blended together into one, the sizzle and soar and bigger-than-you sugar-salt words as you chanted them and felt them blast into you and out of you and stamp you on the world. She loved the hit of the tongue and lips and teeth as the air came up from your lungs, as a curl of something dark and secret-sweet curled up nice and neat in her heart\u2014\nLucy\u2019s it, had a fit, kissed a German idiot!\nAnd we were fast, too fast for Lucy, too fast for the world. And everyone else was faster too, and we were wolves and cheetahs and our teeth were sharp and Lucy was prey, Lucy was always prey with her watery blue eyes and her soft pale skin and we laughed as we darted away from her pudgy pink hands, so slow, so soft and slow, and we could feel the thing under the asphalt and the woodchips and it was strong like us and so it reached up and pushed\u2014\n\u201cLucy\u2019s IT\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou guys\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHad a FIT\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop it, you guys\u2014\u201d\nAnd we were laughing, Lizzie Beth was laughing and Sara Beth was laughing but she was thinking that maybe\u2014\n\u201cPlease, you guys\u2014\u201d\nLucy was twitching\u2014\n\u201cKISSED A GER-MAN ID-EE-IT!\u201d\nAnd Lucy tripped on her untied shoelace, and she hit the ground, and the world broke open beneath her and the first part of the Thing broke through Lucy.\nHer head shrank, and her left eye shrank inside her head, and she was clutching at her heart and we tasted blood and milk chocolate as the spots popped up all over her skin, yellow and red and black, and we laughed (and felt ice up our spines) and we laughed (hearts on a rollercoaster) and her lopsided eyes went misty far-away and she lurched up Not-Lucy, and Sara Beth started to say, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, but\u2014\u201d and Lizzie Beth started to say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anyth\u2014\u201d\nAnd the thing from under the asphalt and the woodchips and the dirt below, the thing in Not-Lucy, the rhyme that was part of some larger Rhyme, the Id-Ee-It, reached out inside us, long dark licorice-sweet tendrils.\nJamie and Jason, said the Idiot. Sitting in a tree\nK-I-S-S-I-N-G\nFirst comes love, then comes marriage\nThen comes a baby in a baby carriage\nAnd it was right. There stood Jamie and Jason, panting with effort from chasing, from being chased, hand in hand. Best friends like Sara Beth and Lizzie Beth, and who did they think they were, trying to be best friends like Sara Beth and Lizzie Beth? Didn\u2019t they know how the world worked? Didn\u2019t they know that Jason was a boy and Jamie was a girl? What did they think was going to happen?\n\u201cJamie and Jason,\u201d Lizzie snarled, and the rest of the kids took it up behind her, \u201csitting in a tree!\u201d\nAnd Jamie and Jason\u2019s fingers started melting together, not quite disappearing into flesh, no, stretching, lengthening, pushing through it like tree roots through clay\u2014\n\u201cKay Aye Ess Ess Aye En Gee!\u201d\n\u2014stretching out over and through each other\u2019s skin like tree roots pushing, pushing, pushing until their whole bodies were fused together and there was a thing pushing out of them, a face, a soft puffy baby face with fat cheeks and little eyes and a little nose and a little mouth, and the little baby face waved its Jason and Jamie arms, and gurgled and laughed and it said:\nChinese, Japanese, dirty knees, look at these!\nAnd like a pack of wolves we turned, swooped down on Jenny Chen.\nNo, thought Sara. No. She tried to remember why she was thinking this.\nChinese, Japanese, dirty knees, look at these!\nYes, Lizzie thought. Yes. Because the rhyme was right, because look at Jenny Chen, really look at her, just realizing something is happening to her. Look at that fat face with its quick-blushing cheeks disappearing her always-weeping eyes behind her glasses, look at that dumb book she hides behind. Listen to her name, Jenny Chen, Jenny Chen, Jenny Chen, she wants to rhyme, she wants to be broken into, she\u2019s asking for it\u2014\n\u201cChinese, Japanese!\u201d the words burst ripe and blood-full and true from Lizzie\u2019s lips, leading the chorus.\n\u201cDirty knees,\u201d Sara whispered, and it was like holding back a wolf to make her voice whisper, the rhyme was curling her heart, saying it wasn\u2019t so bad, not so bad, who did Jenny think she was, getting to be different. She bit her lip but the words pushed out, a strangled sound lost beneath the other children\u2019s roar: \u201cLook at these. . . .\u201d\nAnd on the last line some of the kids grabbed their crotches or their butts or their fronts where girls would get breasts someday, and some of the kids were still twisting the skin around their eyes. And where they grabbed they began to swell and bulge out like faulty balloons, and where they were twisting and pulling their fingers stuck, and they were still chanting, and Jenny Chen was shrinking\u2014no, only parts of her were shrinking, her head and her torso and the tops of her legs, all her fat sliding down her body to lump around her grass-stained knees as the legs beneath her knees stretched, stork-like\u2014\nAnd worse than everything was the taste of guilt in Sara\u2019s mouth, flat and metallic like tinfoil, and the weight of the guilt pressing down on her with all the ways she didn\u2019t have words for it, and Sara was dizzy, and everywhere Sara looked were kids halfway-turning into things like the things she wasn\u2019t ever supposed to look at, dark thrift store dolls with liver lips and too many teeth, oily-skinned plastic dolls out of the back pages of bad magazines, banana-skinned villains out of old comic books. And Lizzie was smiling and Lizzie was her friend, so it had to be all right, didn\u2019t it? Didn\u2019t Sara have to be wrong?\nAnd all the other rhymes were still continuing, spiraling off in fractures and disputed areas, the K-I-S-S-I-N-G splitting into:\nBouncing off the walls, playin\u2019 basketball, drinkin\u2019 alcohol. . . .\nAnd they were ringed all around us, the Idiot, the Dirty Knees, the K-I-S-S-I-N-G, herding us forward\u2014though Lizzie needed no herding, Lizzie grabbed Sara\u2019s hand and pulled her along with those others not yet fully changed\u2014towards the popular girls with pigtails, jumping rope on the blacktop, and we heard the drumbeat machine-gun fire of their words in time with the jumping rope and the basketballs that no longer had hands bouncing them.\nThe Rhymes bowed to the jump-roping girls, to their coming Queen.\nThe eyes of the popular girls were panicked, the eyes of the popular girls sparkled with delight, their eyes were weeping with terror and joy, their mouths opening and closing like slapping shut automatons, their mouths savoring and slurping the rhyme as the thing behind the rhyme, the coming queen of all of the rhymes, the Rhyme itself, pushed through into the world and shattered all its laws forever:\nMiss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack\nAll dressed in black, black, black\nWith silver buttons, buttons, buttons\nAll down her back, back, back\nAnd the girls began to stretch as though their bones were lengthening but the rest of their bodies were not, the skin turning to black cloth and stretching over jagged spikes and their spines arching and glowing silver, their clothing ash-burning to black silk that draped them like governesses, and their mouths kept making the words pop out light and perfect and right\u2014\u201cMiss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack\u201d\u2014as their mouths stretched open like they were screaming, as they began to choke, to cough, and they retched black slime and quarters and silver buttons, buttons, buttons. . . .\nSara was lost, Sara was losing, Sara just wanted her parents to show up and make it stop, make the world make sense and go back in straight lines, but she could feel the Rhyme reaching for her, pushing rhymes up inside her, and she knew that it was feeding spreading sprawling fungus and there was nothing she could do.\nThe clinking sound as the buttons hit the blacktop was a light and silver laugh to Lizzie. She was dizzy, she was soaring, she was a bird of prey and she would strike and slash in service to her queen, and never have to say sorry again.\nI will serve you forever, thought Lizzie. I will be your lady-in-waiting, your princess, your white knight. She began to kneel.\nSara saw her friend begin to kneel.\nSara Beth grabbed her shoulder.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sara Beth, and it was so hard to get past her lips it seemed like it was all she could ever say, but when it popped out more not-rhyme words were waiting, pushing behind it. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t. Not that. Not ever that.\u201d\nThe bodies straightened. The faces went still.\nMiss Mary Mack in her seven bodies turned in one movement towards us, and we saw her eyes, and her necklaces.\nHer fourteen eyes were silver buttons, and her seven necks were strung with ivory cameos, carved with the screaming faces of seven little girls.\n\u201cRun!\u201d Sara Beth yelled at Lizzie Beth, and we ran towards the school, and the other kids followed us, and the rhymes were behind us, the servants of the High Court of Miss Mary Mack, they came on paws and tentacles and long legs and short legs and no legs, their claws cutting into the turf as they thundered behind us, their voices whispering, uncurling in our minds, stroking our thoughts for a handhold\u2014\nThe steamboat went to HELLO operator, please give me number nine\nAnd Lizzie Beth was running because Sara Beth was running but she didn\u2019t know why Sara Beth was running, the rhymes were beautiful, the rhymes were true, but if Sara Beth was running then she must be right\u2014\nSpiders crawling up your back\nAnd the arms and legs of the children around us split, extended, cracked twice in the middle and they waved them in the air\u2014\nAnd Sara Beth was slowing down because Lizzie Beth was slowing down, because she couldn\u2019t leave her behind\u2014\nCrack an egg on your head, let the blood run down\nAnd yolks dripped down heads next to us, and eyes dripped down, and the tops of heads slipped and slid and slurped down the faces like melting ice, skidding in dribbles and chunks down the fronts and backs, and the bodies lurching, lurching forward, and Sara Beth slipped in a puddle and a black-spotted hand reached out for her\u2014\nAnd Sara Beth\u2019s eyes got so wide that Lizzie Beth knew it was a bad thing\u2014\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lizzie Beth yelled, and stomped the hand, and pulled Sara Beth up, and pushed her into the school doorway. We were running for the principal, for the teacher, for people who we didn\u2019t know couldn\u2019t help us. We were almost to the classroom\u2014\nAnd our rhyme caught us.\nIt was like a dark tendril catching around the corners of our heart, a vine twining up our ribcage and around our lungs until it could slide the words up our throats and unfurl them past our lips.\nFirst is the worst\n\u201cFirst is the worst!\u201d\nAnd Alex was rolling on the floor, boneless, tentacles twitching from his gelatinous form\u2014\nSecond is the\u2014\n\u201c\u2014best!\u201d\nAnd Molly\u2019s skin cracked and through the cracks gleamed such golden light that it hurt to look at her, it hurt to look as the golden claws ripped through her fingernails and golden wings ripped out of her shoulder blades and red blood ran down her face as mouths with little golden fangs ripped through her skin\u2014\nThird\u2014\n\u201c\u2014is the one with the treasure chest!\u201d\nAnd Theo\u2019s back bent and snapped under the weight of his stomach, beams of wood bursting through his T-shirt and splintering as they spilled his guts to the ground\u2014\nAnd we could not stop the next line, our line, it pushed out of our mouths as we gripped each other\u2019s hands:\n\u201cFourth is\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014a dwarf!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014the one in the wedding dress!\u201d\nFourth is a dwarf\/the one in the wedding dress!\nAnd our voices broke apart, the way they always did, and our rhyme snagged\u2014it screamed\u2014the part of the Thing that was almost all the way into our heads meshed and tore and clanged and banged an off-key tune\u2014Sara Beth stumbled and Lizzie Beth fell, and our worlds pressed together, tore apart, blurred, fractured, melted and melded together at uneven seams\u2014\nAnd when we could finally stand, the rhymes did not pursue us.\n* * *\nWhen playground rhymes broke into the world, other things came through.\nAfter we ran from our school, we saw some families, grown-ups and toddlers, trying to defend themselves with nursery rhymes. The grown-ups chanted and the babies listened and the little kids\u2019 belief hung life on the word-skeletons. But the things we saw them call up were soft and bloated, light pink and blue balloons of flesh, Disney cartoons of the sharp and scratching power that nursery rhymes might have been if third-graders like us had done the calling for them. Lizzie Beth said it was because the grown-ups weren\u2019t mean enough, didn\u2019t like being mean enough. Sara Beth said it was because the toddlers didn\u2019t know enough words, couldn\u2019t concentrate. We watched the nursery rhymes bumble back and forth, bumping into each other and the walls, their anime eyes blank and vacant. The nursery rhymes just stood there as the playground rhymes came for the families.\nWe just stood there too.\nLizzie Beth wanted to fight them, but Sara Beth was too afraid. What happened at school might have been a one-time miracle.\nWe stayed in the shadows. Stalked a group of slam poets for a week, tall teenagers slouching along in a pink pickup truck with a boom box blaring from the back, the poets rapping along with hard-hitting consonants and long low mournful vowels, pushing back the playground rhymes with the weapons they called up, words so raw and hard and rough that Sara Beth and Lizzie Beth couldn\u2019t believe the poets\u2019 throats didn\u2019t rip as they roared out their own monsters, dark scuttling spidery things with eyes made of mirror shards, and razor blade legs that slashed and ripped the playground rhymes to shreds in seconds.\nWe had favorites, of course. Lizzie Beth loved Ty, all brooding dark eyes and copper-skinned muscles stretching the fit of the T-shirt that read BITCH I KNOW WHAT AN ANAPEST IS. Sara Beth loved Mariana, with her rainbow hair and cobra earrings and the way her voice stretched and broke on certain words, like she couldn\u2019t believe how beautiful they were, like she\u2019d opened up a dictionary and found a stained glass window.\nWe had favorites, but it was hard to argue anymore.\nThe poets were big, and brave, and beautiful, and we watched them like the good guys in a Saturday morning superhero show, waiting to see how they would save the world.\nThey were almost grown-ups. They must have had a plan to save the world.\nBut it only takes one crack to let in a rhyme.\nA sailor went to the sea, sea, sea\nTo see what he could see, see, see\nBut all that he could see, see, see\nWas the bottom of the deep blue sea, sea, sea!\nAnd the See came into their circle and into their minds, its rippling blue gaze and its smell of brine, and it came to see what it could see and all that it could see was itself, and so the slam poets and their poems were blued, were salted, were drowned, were unseen into nothingness, were washed away and re-seen to become the bottom layer of the deep blue Sea, Sea, See.\nBut the See could not see us.\n* * *\nMonths afterward, we saw a homeless man untaken, muttering under his breath as he walked, \u201cAnd his eyes had all the seeming of a demon\u2019s that is dreaming, that is dreaming, that is dreaming, and his eyes had all the seeming\u2014\u201d And his shadow stretching out behind him rippled in a parliament of ravens, and he kept walking.\nHe was the last real person we saw.\n* * *\nWhy us, why playground rhymes? We asked ourselves those questions in all those months after everyone died, after the laws of reality took a holiday, after the world broke into a place where screams were music and loneliness was yellow and the taste of lemon flew through the air on the backs of nine-eyed camels and flesh was an accessory worn by rhymes from the place we had unlocked. The months when our hair grew long and nails went uncut and our stomachs growled and questions were all we had. The months that became years that we lost track of.\nWe used to go to libraries and read the books, to see if we could have answers too. But the books were written by grown-ups, and it seems that grown-ups did not want to remember the things they chanted in playgrounds so long ago.\nBut it was their fault too. The rhymes were underneath their playgrounds too, their grass and asphalt and sand. We couldn\u2019t have done it all ourselves.\nIt couldn\u2019t have just been us.\nNot us.\n* * *\nWho are we?\nWe\u2019re Lizzie Beth and Sara Beth.\nJust don\u2019t ask who\u2019s who.\nWe try to look but we can\u2019t see. We know that Sara Beth and Lizzie Beth run together, we hear our footsteps side by side, but we cannot turn our heads to determine who is the other, and which one we are. Mirrors and shop windows and puddles blur before our eyes. We catch sideways glimpses\u2014Sara Beth\u2019s braids with the pink and purple beads, long grown out to slap against our knees; Lizzie Beth\u2019s short-bitten nails scratching an itch (on whose nose?). We remember all that Sara Beth and Lizzie Beth were, and we are all that Lizzie Beth and Sara Beth could have been, and we wonder which one we are right now, where we could draw the line. On the bad days, which are less and less as we relearn the world, Sara Beth cries for her Mommy and her Mom and Mr. Whiskers and her big brother Ralph, and Lizzie Beth beats our fists against trees and wails for her Gramma and Grampa and Daddy and Orange the Dog. Together we mourn all the things that were ours, and all the things that might not have been. Which is which? Who is who? We do not, cannot know.\nAnd neither can anyone else.\nThe thing that broke the world and was broken into Miss Mary Mack and her legion of courtiers cannot sense us. We were never broken into, only broken; cracked and half-mended and left fused together, not ourselves but something somewhere in between.\nWe catch hints, sometimes, of the rhyme that was meant for us. A wisp of the white Wedding Dress as it withdraws behind a window, sequins sparkling in the fading sunlight, or the rasp of its fine lace train as it wavers uncertainly behind us. We hear the quick clomp of the Dwarf\u2019s iron-crusted boots, the scrape of its pickaxe along the street (and within us-ourself, Lizzie Beth is triumphant, because it was the hobbit movie kind of dwarf after all). But we don\u2019t see them full on, because they never made it all the way here, never got to be one solid thing. We stopped them. They stumble on behind, uncertain of us, uncertain of theirself\/themselves, whispering, Fourth is. . . .\nBut Sara Beth and Lizzie Beth are never quite there, so our Rhyme can never quite come through.\nAnd so we run and run and run, until the rubber soles are flapping and the bottoms of our feet are bleeding and then we steal brand-new Nikes off the shelves at Walmart, and we cut holes in the ceilings of CVS Pharmacies and make fires in the middle of the aisles where we roast marshmallows and make them catch on fire on purpose and mash the carbon crust between chocolate and graham crackers and dare each-other-ourselves to climb the shelves and ride the bikes and crash all the jeeps in the parking lot into each other. Our teeth fall out black and our hands are smoke- and dirt-smeared and we burn down libraries because even if it makes her sick inside, Sara Beth hopes that losing the words that they\u2019re made of will send all the rhymes back, and we burn down libraries because Lizzie Beth only feels right anymore when she looks at the fire. We look out for ourselves-each-other. We run and we\u2019re wolves, we\u2019re wild, we\u2019re never going to grow up and leave each other behind.\nWe\u2019ll be best friends forever.\nGabriela Santiago lives and works in St. Paul, Minnesota, where despite the fact that she writes stories like this one, two separate organizations have entrusted her with the minds of small children.

Miller","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"There was once a city near these dunes, dunes as purple as the King of Summer\u2019s prizest plums. But plums and peaches and sweet juicy things don\u2019t grow here and never have. Nothing grew here then and nothing grows here now except the sand.\nIn the kingdom of the purple dunes, anthills grow to grotesque dimensions, ziggurats teasing the sky, and antlions are forever funneling and escaping the collapse until they drown, their tiny bodies choked with sand. Nothing grows and nothing lasts, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been. Homes, families, bloodlines: all vanished under the rising tide of sand. And so did the spot on the beach where you liked to sit with your legs spread far apart and your toes in the water, where the sea brought you the coiled burrow of some pink and fleshy thing with one, two, three wavelets: and there it is, warm in your hands. Footprints were always the first to vanish. Your mother\u2019s, your daughter\u2019s, your lover\u2019s. Skypotter learned that better than anyone. Sculptress, mother, maker of homes, widow, and wanderer. Skypotter, who found a friend where others saw only an enemy. Maybe her heart has always been in the earth.\nMany many seasons ago, a few foolish men, acting out their endless courtship with all that is gaudy and glittering, made their home near a beach of purple sand. This was long before the sand put a day\u2019s walk between the city and the sea, and they thought they could fish and draw salt from the sea and eat gull eggs and spend their long lives basking in an endless summer\u2019s golden light. The King\u2019s molten medallion dangles bright above here still. The way it catches in the sand, turning the grains a little paler, almost pink, must have set their little boy hearts aflame.\nThe first funeral exposed the sand\u2019s true nature: a hand unburied the morning after, reaching for the King\u2019s rising medallion. There were no beasts to dig it up. Nothing is dumb enough to live in the dunes except men. But the body would not stay buried, pushed around and unearthed by the growing tide of sand. After that, there were sea burials and sky burials, excarnations by shark and gull. But the founders were proud of their city, proud of their strange sand and their stranger ways.\nIn Skypotter\u2019s time, many seasons later, it became the fashion to gather the sand in jars and cups. People liked to watch it grow, admire it as you might admire a soul expanding in the vessel of your daughter\u2019s body as she endures one summer after another. They gathered it in jars and sealed bottles and watched it creep up the sides day by day until it pushed the lids off their jars and broke the bottles with one mortal crack. The sand seeks the easiest path to the sun.\nMaybe Skypotter was the first to bring it inside the city, captured in one of her own earthen jars. She made them from the clay they pulled from distant wells. Her pots were like bubbles of earth. She molded figurines from the purple sand, binding all the grains together with glue from the bark of the spiral trees that grew far inland. She loved to watch them destroy themselves, an arm bursting here, a leg crumbling there. A chest swelling with pride and a purple heart bursting.\nPretty soon, she found out how difficult it is to remove every grain of sand from your house. If you left but one grain on the table or on the floor, fallen in a crack perhaps, you came home from sunbathing to find little purple mounds here and there. You found the first one with your bare foot, like a tiny pool of cool water. The hunt for the final grain began again, and only children have patience for such things.\nPeace ended the day Skypotter\u2019s only daughter died. She came home and found her baby sky blue and suffocated, a spoon still clenched in her fist. Her tongue lolled out, stained plum purple. The whole city heard Potter\u2019s wail. They dropped their fish nets and prayer wheels, their shell knives and grass baskets, and ran, but Skypotter was already gone.\nThey found her smiling like she\u2019d seen the vault of the seasons, all teeth and tight cheek wrinkles. She was gone, away. She had left them. Maybe she could see the vault, the season cycle, the great wheel of rebirth, and she glimpsed her last life or her next, or maybe all of them, ever, infinite and forever, all her lives flashing before her eyes, and what she saw made her drop all her grief and sorrow like a bag of sand on the beach. In the kingdom of the sun, your life flashes before your eyes when someone you love is lost. Maybe it breaks you, maybe it doesn\u2019t. Hearts are made differently, from stone or water or sand. Some are better at breaking.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d a shy little woman said. \u201cPotter. Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be just fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here if you need me,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cThanks, honey. But I won\u2019t.\u201d\nEveryone gathered before panic could spread. They decided that their children and their children\u2019s children were in danger, and they held council. Already a few foolish men were building barrows and fashioning shovels. They knew what the frightened mob would decide, the few voices of dissent pushed down.\n\u201cBy the King and Queen of Summer, I will see this sand thrown back into the sea!\u201d\n\u201cSkypotter, we\u2019ll not let it happen again.\u201d\n\u201cWe never should have brought this shit into our homes,\u201d an old woman said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Potter. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBut Skypotter was already walking away, putting distance between herself and the people, her long black locks dragging behind and making worm trails in the sand.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s she goin\u2019?\u201d they said. \u201cWhere\u2019s she goin\u2019?\u201d\nIf only they knew.\nThough the foolish men who built the city had all gone back to the wheel, others had replaced them. The wheel is full of foolish men. There are always more yet to be born. They made it their purpose to push the sand back into the sea. Some said it couldn\u2019t grow underwater, that it needed heat or sun or both, and that the sea was cool. But it was warm as bathwater and probably wouldn\u2019t have worked anyway, but that was what they decided, to gather it and drop it in the sea, spadeful by spadeful, barrowful by barrowful. Handful by handful.\nSkypotter never lifted a shovel. Though the sand had taken her daughter, it was that to which she gave her heart. Everyone needs a companion, and maybe it is as they say and everything is someone: every tree, bug, shell, and stone. Skypotter and the sand were just two lonely souls coming together, then.\n\u201cCome help us,\u201d someone would say to her. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing the sand back. It\u2019s working.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s work all right,\u201d Skypotter would say.\nOr: \u201cWhy bother? If we were meant for digging, we\u2019d have spades and picks for hands and feet. Like a shark has fins for water.\u201d\nIn their daylong toil, the people would ask, \u201cWhere are you going, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cTo the beach,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting any closer.\u201d\nAnd Skypotter sat in the dunes or on the beach between ribs of sand made by the wind. She drew sand up by the handful and let it glide between the crack of her joined hands. She wiped her palms, a few grains left in the creases, the place she was the palest. She held still and saw two grains split into four. And she talked to the sand and the parade of people hauling bags and barrows of sand to the beach along the road they plowed anew each day. She mocked their work and laughed at their scorched and sweating faces, but seeing that no one seemed to hear or care\u2014because they were gone too, you see, away, in another direction\u2014she directed her attention to the sand.\nYou heard her from afar, paused, and listened to the waves of her voice, your shovel getting heavy in your hands, sweat dripping into your eyes.\n\u201cHot hot hot. It\u2019s taking seasons off my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sweating them off, see? They say it wasn\u2019t always so hot, oh no, not at all. They say the King of Winter reigned here. Snow and ice and all his other tricks. This was in history, or whatever they say, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t even remember where I put my shoes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m barefoot all the time, you know. Maybe you keep taking my shoes. How many do you need? Now wouldn\u2019t that be rich if after all their busyfootin\u2019, you just up and walked away.\u201d\nAnd she laughed like a flock of gulls circling over the bright plum dunes. And then you went back to shoveling, a little ashamed and sick in the deep of your stomach because just then all that work seemed so silly and Skypotter seemed so right.\nThere were nights Skypotter fell asleep in the dunes and woke a little farther away from home. Just the way she liked it. Her home was one of the first to fall. People said she didn\u2019t even notice.\nNo one understood. The collective sorrow of her daughter\u2019s death was replaced by fear of the expanding sand, and people were free to call Skypotter names behind her back. They said she was mad, sunstruck like the once-great founder Flybottle, who soaked the sand with his family\u2019s blood. One or two reached out to her, but they were too meek or tired to make a difference. All the others let her be, considered her lost. Too late for this one. She could have tried to reach them, but maybe she was too proud or stubborn or content with the way things were. Maybe she was beyond all of it then and could see things they couldn\u2019t see. She was buoyant in the days after her daughter\u2019s death, lit from within. Ascendant.\nSo she walked the dunes and talked to the sand. When the sand finally talked back, she was only surprised at what it had to say.\n\u201cMagical sand that comes alive before your very eyes, feel it move and watch it grow! Shape, mold, and play!\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Skypotter said. She thought a moment. \u201cWell, bless you. You tell \u2019em. Playing\u2019s what they need.\u201d And she looked over her shoulder at the line of bleary silhouettes on the horizon. They could have been a mirage.\nThe voice of the sand was far away, the voice was a whisper, something you heard when you laid down to sleep, and sometimes it repeated itself and sometimes it spoke before Skypotter did, resuming a conversation that never ended. In that way, they never had to say goodbye.\n\u201cWould all employees please come to meeting room 114A for today\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that,\u201d Skypotter said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be a baby and talk baby talk, I\u2019ll just go home.\u201d\nChildren and weary sand haulers traded tales of voices in the sand. A phantom, they said, and she had a voice like wind tearing sand from the earth.\nSkypotter spent more and more of her days in the dunes. She built her own city there, and she woke from a catnap to find her towers toppled and staircases elongated like sea worms reaching for an urchin to eat. She laughed to see them destroy themselves. She beachcombed, kicking aside the dead heads of fish and the rubbery bodies of rotting sharks. She was always sad when she found a snail dried up in its shell. They were her favorite, their shells tucked into every nook of her house. If she left them on the beach, the sand would swallow them, but maybe they were preserved somehow, somewhere far below, in the sand.\nMaybe everything that falls under the sand is fossilized or mummified by the sand and the sea salt, and there are crypts somewhere below, to be opened in another season by baffled men in strange dress and speaking a strange tongue from a season when another Queen sits on the throne. Mummified sharks on catafalques of purple sand. A mausoleum of melting cartilage and salted shell, fish skeletons piled in the corners of the undercroft.\nWell, she could dream.\nAnd so could the people around her, a sun dream of changing the shape of the earth.\n\u201cYou hear them up there?\u201d Skypotter asked the sand. \u201cHoller, bitch, and bicker. Don\u2019t work with your friends, you\u2019ll be sorry. Things are falling down up there. I wonder. I wonder.\u201d\nAnd the sand replied: \u201cNot all things are permanent, except your fascination with crazy sand!\u201d\nShe had nothing to say to that. Maybe the words all meant something to Skypotter, wise and queenly as she had become. Maybe she decoded some secret, and that\u2019s why she left the way she did. Maybe the words were the key to the whole wheel. But to the few others who heard them, they were nonsense, haunted voices from the past, their words ancient and unknowable. Who knows what magic they held in that world lost so long ago? What message might the sand have preserved and sent through time, space, and the seasons?\nOne day, Skypotter came closer to it. She found the sand\u2019s mouth between two folds of the dunes.\nShe stood before a big rectangle glowing darkness in the sunlit dunes. It was covered in a film of dust like a cloth draped over a table. Wires like the nerves of rotting teeth hung from the upper jaw: red, yellow, black cords shuddering in the breeze that blew from below. The roof was cracked and peeling, the tongue a strip of dark red dampness. The sand\u2019s breath smelled like salt and mold and thunderstorms.\nSkypotter circled the mouth and put out a hand to clear away the dust, but she froze, as if afraid of what she might find underneath the dust, afraid there would be nothing.\nBut that box had always been there for her to find. She had just been looking in all the wrong places. For days, she sat in front of the mouth and listened, a rapturous grin on her face. You\u2019d swear to the King she was floating a hand\u2019s breadth off the ground.\nThe sand\u2019s words were loud and clear: \u201cIncredible crazy sand. Reduces stress, keeps kids busy for hours. You\u2019ll never put it down!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I\u2019ll do,\u201d Skypotter said.\n\u201cExpands when heated. Just put it under the sun. No preparation required! Great for children and adults, at home or at the office. It\u2019s sand-tastic!\u201d\nSkypotter laughed. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d\n\u201cTry a free sample of our sand-tastic living growing crazy sand and get playing!\u201d\nSometimes she took its advice.\nAnd one day, after the people in the city had grown their wrinkles and grudges deep, Skypotter walked into the mouth.\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d she said, and stepped inside. She tripped on the lower lip and fell against the wall.\nA click, a ding, and then, \u201cI\u2019m coming, honey. I\u2019m coming.\u201d\nAnd the mouth closed. Skypotter descended. The sand continued to rise, and only one tired old woman saw her disappear, her lives flashing before her eyes in one long dazzling ribbon, and she knew then that they would never push the sand into the sea.\nKyle E.

Mom didn\u2019t know yet; it was our big-brother\/little-sister secret. Like the time he took me to see Night of the Worm People even though it was rated R, only not as fun and the nightmares didn\u2019t go away after a few days.\nStill, he took it well (he was cool like that), and sometimes he even joked about it, as if fitting his human skin over the mass of wings and black-feathered bodies and sharp blue-smoke beaks was no big deal. I knew he was joking for my sake.\nThe skin was my gift. I bought it from a witch at the edge of the Dark Lands, in exchange for the memories of my last five birthdays. It was the least I could do, since Elliot had lost his body to save me in the first place.\nThe skin worked well enough to fool the whole world. I was the only one, it seemed, who saw those moments when it twitched at the sudden flurry of buried wings, or when his eyes opened and a cluster of black beads peered out.\nWe shared a lot of secrets like that. We looked out for each other. Which was why I went back to the Dark Lands, and why I didn\u2019t tell him.\nOn the day before his birthday, I packed my book bag and left for school at the usual time. As soon as my house was out of sight, I slipped off the sidewalk and down into the woods, circling around to the old and twisted oak that marked the entrance. It was pretty hard to miss: its thick branches hung nearly to the ground, stark and leafless, and its bark was almost black. It was a tree that had died a long time ago but refused to fall over or rot completely away. A zombie tree. I circled it once and was through.\nIt\u2019s easy to tell the difference the moment you slip over to the other side. The air gets chilly and all the trees around you start looking like that zombie oak, and nettles and undergrowth carpet the woods, a deep rich green the color of dark emeralds. There\u2019s always a path, too, because the people of the Dark Lands are all about paths and whether you stick to them or not.\nProfessional Tip: sticking to the path won\u2019t keep you safe, but it will keep you marginally safer. Never confuse the two. All it really means is that anything trying to kill you or steal your eyes or whatever has to give you a fighting chance. Leave the path, and all bets are off.\nSo I stuck to the path, picked a direction and walked, figuring I\u2019d run into something sooner or later. I hadn\u2019t gone far when I saw a man (an elf? A fae? I was never a hundred percent sure on the terminology here) standing on the path, tugging on the leash of a shaggy dog about the size of a large pony. He was tall and sapling-thin, with a floppy green hat the same dark emerald color as the forest floor. A ridiculously large feather bobbed from its brim as he heaved against the dog, who had dug its paws into the soil and refused to budge. He snarled and swore at the poor thing, and the dog whined and shook its furry head.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, as politely as I could. \u201cIs there a problem I could help with?\u201d\nAnother Professional Tip: if you see something going down on the path, always interfere (unless you\u2019ve been told not to).\nThe elf man stopped tugging, but he didn\u2019t loosen his grip on the leash. He stood up straight, tipped his hat to me, and smiled. The smile slid across his face like butter across a hot griddle. He wasn\u2019t bad looking; in fact, he was one of the prettier beings I\u2019d seen here, and he smelled nice, like a flowery shampoo my mom uses. But his nose was sharp as an icicle, and his eyes were just as cold.\n\u201cGood evening, miss . . . ?\u201d he said, leaving me to supply my name.\n\u201cI am the Blueberry Knight,\u201d I said, since people didn\u2019t give out their real names here, just titles. I was wearing a hoodie with a trio of smiling blueberries over my heart, in that kawaii Japanese style that you find in import stores. Beneath them were the words \u201cHappy Day.\u201d Not the most impressive coat for a knight, but it was a coat nonetheless and the smiling blueberries cheered me up.\nI think it must\u2019ve been a birthday present, because I don\u2019t remember when I got it.\nThe elf man\u2019s smile didn\u2019t waver, though his eyes flicked to the blueberries and then to my face. I could tell that he\u2019d been hoping I\u2019d slip up and give my real name, and then he\u2019d have me. But I learned a few tricks the last time I was in the Dark Lands, after I\u2019d been suckered in here and spirited away in a flouncy black dress to be the bride of the Prince of Thorns. I wasn\u2019t going to be fooled again.\n\u201cCharmed,\u201d he said, bowing like a reed in a stiff breeze. \u201cYou may call me Hans.\u201d\nHans was a generic name, like Jack. It could mean anything. At minimum, it meant he was more dangerous than he looked.\n\u201cAnd what business brings you to these lands, Blueberry Knight?\u201d he went on.\nI threw back my chin and adopted what I hoped was a brave pose. \u201cI am here to restore my brother, Crowsbody, to his rightful form.\u201d\nHans chuckled softly. \u201cA valiant wish, to be sure!\u201d\n\u201cAnd where are you going, Hans?\u201d I asked. \u201cYour dog doesn\u2019t seem too eager to go with you.\u201d\nHe scowled at the dog and gave it another sharp tug\u2014not even to try to budge it, but just to hurt it. My stomach clenched. \u201cI am taking this cur here to market to be sold,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is no longer worth the trouble. Perhaps I can get something for her meat.\u201d\nI glanced at the dog, who peered out at me with one frightened eye from beneath long bangs of gray fur. What else could I do? \u201cHow much are you looking to sell her for?\u201d\nHans\u2019s eyes shot toward mine. There was that sly, buttery grin. \u201cI won\u2019t take any less than three magic beans for her,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have any, that is.\u201d He regarded his fingernails, which were in pretty good shape. Pretty good as in salon-quality, cheerleader nails.\nI pulled my book bag off my shoulders. I\u2019d brought a few things from home (the people here were big into bartering), but I wasn\u2019t sure if any of them were worth magic beans. I pulled out a cherrywood music box, turned the key, and let it play a few bars of \u201cMemory.\u201d \u201cWill you take this for her?\u201d\nBut his eyes slid past the music box to the inside of my book bag. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, and his long fingers jumped forward but stopped before they could reach uninvited into my stuff. \u201cAnd what is that you have there?\u201d He pointed to a Swiss Army knife.\nI wasn\u2019t too eager to barter that; it was just too practical. But he wouldn\u2019t even look at anything else I offered. So I pulled out the knife and handed it to him.\nHe flicked out the little blade and ran one finger over its flat edge. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is very well crafted. It is a fine exchange.\u201d He flicked the blade back into its shell. \u201cYou may have the dog for this.\u201d\nI glanced at the dog, whose eyes begged me. I nodded.\nHans\u2019s grin spread. The Swiss Army knife disappeared into his sleeve. He handed me the dog\u2019s leash. \u201cA pleasure doing business with you, Blueberry Knight,\u201d he said, and bowed low. The feather swept almost to the ground. With one last mean look at the dog, he turned and strode away down the path.\n\u201cThank goodness,\u201d said the dog. It had a soft, feminine voice. \u201cI thought I would never be free of him!\u201d She looked at me with deep brown puppy eyes. \u201cAnd thank you, lady knight.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd where are you going, lady knight?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI need to find a way to get my brother\u2019s human form back. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d know anyone who could help me?\u201d\nThe dog tilted her head and lifted one ear. \u201cI heard my master talking about a tournament that is to be held at the market today,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prize for the winner is a single wish.\u201d\nThat sounded promising. A single wish was all I needed. \u201cDo you know where the market is?\u201d\nShe turned and aimed her nose down the path, then looked back at me over her shoulder. \u201cA proper knight needs a proper mount,\u201d she said. \u201cClimb onto my back, and I will carry you there.\u201d\nI grinned. Who could say no to a cool shaggy riding dog? I sat on her back; her fur was incredibly soft. \u201cThanks. What should I call you?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cmy former master never called me anything besides cur or bitch.\u201d\n\u201cYou need a better name than that!\u201d I said. \u201cMay I call you Sasha?\u201d I dunno why the name popped into my head, but she looked like a Sasha. I guess you had to be there.\n\u201cYou may,\u201d said Sasha. She sounded pleased.\n* * *\nThe market was hard to miss. In a clearing where the land dipped low into a bowl was a cluster of bright tents in sunset reds and bright purples and parrot blues. The rim of the bowl was scooped out of the black soil and held in place by the giant, snaking roots of the zombie trees. A steady stream of the Dark Land\u2019s denizens flowed in and out, their arms full of baskets or wrapped bundles or whatever they had come to buy or sell.\nSasha carried me down the curve of the bowl and into the market, the Blueberry Knight on her shaggy dog steed. We got a lot of looks, some curious, others hostile. Maybe they thought I was looking too much like a hero, coming to stir up trouble.\nOn the far side of the market was a little enclosed green, and on the far side of the green was a stand under a big purple awning. It looked like it might be the sort of place to have a tournament, so I directed Sasha onto the green and looked around for, well, anybody.\n\u201cOh!\u201d came a high voice from the shadows under the awning. \u201cAnother player in the tournament! How marvelous!\u201d A figure stood and skipped out into the overcast daylight, clapping little white hands. She had that young-ageless look that was so popular around here: about my height, with a round girlish face that made her look a couple of years younger than me. In fact, she could\u2019ve passed for a Victorian doll brought to life, with her mass of honey-gold ringlets, purple dress that was about ninety percent lace and frills\u2014the works. She was probably at least a couple of thousand years old.\nStill, she grinned at me like a little girl who\u2019d just been given the proverbial pony for Christmas. Her poison-green eyes had slits in them, and when she smiled I saw sharp little fangs, like cat\u2019s teeth.\n\u201cWhat is your name, girl?\u201d she asked, leaning forward over the platform\u2019s railing.\n\u201cI am the Blueberry Knight,\u201d I said in my best knight-voice.\n\u201cThe Blueberry Knight, how marvelous!\u201d she squealed again. This was going to get old fast, I could tell. \u201cHere, let me explain the rules.\u201d She gestured sharply toward another figure on the platform, who came forward into the light with slow, stiff steps. He\u2019d been so still in the shadows, I hadn\u2019t even noticed him there. He was dressed in a faded gray pageboy uniform, and stared straight ahead with glassy gray eyes. All of him was pale and washed out, as if someone had dragged an eraser over him just to take off the top layer of pigment but didn\u2019t bother to remove him completely. He held out a piece of bright sky-blue cloth edged in black fringe.\nHis grayness only made the blue of the cloth and the bruise-purple of the elf-woman\u2019s dress stick out all the more. Next to her, he almost vanished. She took the cloth without so much as a thank you and gestured for me to step forward. She tied the cloth around my arm.\n\u201cThis is a sign that you\u2019re in the tournament,\u201d she said. \u201cEach duel is one-on-one. You may challenge anyone you see on the market grounds who bears this flag, and they may challenge you. The person who issues the challenge may choose its terms, so be on your toes.\u201d Her eyes flashed and she grinned a nasty grin, like she was sharing a mean joke with a friend. \u201cAt sunset, the first part of the tournament will end, and all those who are still in shall return to this spot, and depending on the number remaining\u2014if there is more than one remaining\u2014it will be decided then how to proceed with final eliminations.\u201d She patted the neat little knot just above my elbow. \u201cAll clear?\u201d\n\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I said.\nShe looked past me and smirked. I whirled just in time to see a short goblin with a similar blue flag on his arm. His mouth was already open and he was sucking in breath to speak.\n\u201cI challenge you!\u201d I cried, half in panic.\nThe elf-girl tittered behind me. The goblin scowled, and his thick fingers reached for a mace at his hip.\n\u201cWell, silly,\u201d came the high-pitched voice behind me, \u201cyou challenged first! Choose the terms.\u201d\n\u201cSpelling contest,\u201d I blurted out. I was decent enough at spelling. \u201cSingle elimination.\u201d\nThe goblin didn\u2019t have eyebrows, but his forehead slid up his skull and bunched into impressive wrinkles. The elf-girl smiled.\n\u201cI see you get the idea,\u201d she said. \u201cVery well, I will be the arbiter of this challenge. Blueberry Knight, please spell regal.\u201d\nHonestly, I was expecting something harder. But I wasn\u2019t gonna look a gift horse in the mouth. Not here. \u201cRegal,\u201d I said. \u201cAre. Eee. Gee. Ae. El. Regal.\u201d\nThe elf-girl smiled. \u201cCorrect. And Mister Gristlebottom, your turn. Spell perspicacious.\u201d\nIf possible, the furrows in his brow grew even deeper. I actually felt sorry for him. Maybe the elf-girl liked me, but it felt like cheating.\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the goblin, \u201cperstipashius. Purr with a stick in the middle, and a fish on the end. Nice cat-kabob goes down sweet, yes. Yes?\u201d He added that last \u2018yes\u2019 with a hopeful glance at the elf-girl.\nShe looked down on him as if he were a squashed bug beneath her pumps. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, in that way that suggested she really wasn\u2019t. \u201cThat is incorrect. Winner is the Blueberry Knight. You may turn in your blue flag.\u201d\nThe goblin growled and all but ripped the flag off his arm, throwing it at the feet of the gray pageboy.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201cgood try!\u201d I stuck out a hand. It never hurt to be gracious in the Dark Lands.\nHe harrumphed, glared at me, and stalked off.\nThe elf-girl\u2019s cat grin grew wider. \u201cWell, Blueberry Knight,\u201d she said, \u201cwe expect good things from you.\u201d Then she spun neatly on her heel and flounced back to her shadowed throne.\n* * *\nI figured out quickly how treacherous this tournament was. It was a game for the sneaky, the backstabbers, the kind of people who lingered in shadows and who knew how to hit first. Those who didn\u2019t were quickly eliminated. I felt paranoid turning every corner, afraid someone would spot me and issue a challenge to a duel by clubs or swords or flying fire-potion or God knows what else they have here that can kill or seriously maim you. I couldn\u2019t even enjoy the market stalls. What if I turned my back to look at some fairy pottery, and some troll came up behind me and challenged me before I knew he was there?\nI felt guilty about it. But it was for my brother, so if I had to be sneaky I\u2019d be sneaky. I beat them with anything I thought I could get away with: math, skipping rope, facts about American history. (I never thought I\u2019d say this, but thank goodness for homework!) I even beat a proud elf-lord with a challenge of humility. (He sneered at me and told me he would never partake in such a silly challenge. I told him that I won.)\nSince the sky was a solid sheet of dull gray clouds, I had to guess when sunset was. When it started to grow dark around the edges of the bowl, I climbed onto Sasha\u2019s back and rode to the little fenced-in green by the covered stands. I saw the outline of the elf-woman\u2019s puffy skirts in the shadows, and I guessed that the ghostly shape behind her was the pageboy. But no one else was milling about. I looked around, wary of being out in the open but also wondering if I were, miraculously, the only one left.\n\u201cI challenge you, Blueberry Knight!\u201d said a voice behind me.\nI nearly jumped straight off of Sasha\u2019s back. My whole insides clenched. I turned around and saw Hans and his slick smile. His long fingers flicked the blade of my Swiss Army knife in and out, in and out.\n\u201cBattle by knife,\u201d he added casually, almost as an afterthought.\nI was screwed.\n\u201cOh, marvelous!\u201d squealed the elf-lady from the stands, clapping her little white hands. I wished I could slap her.\nI stepped into the middle of the green with Hans, leaving my stomach on the ground behind me. Sasha licked my hand as I passed her, and the gesture made me feel just a smidge better.\nStill, how could I win a knife fight when I didn\u2019t even have a knife? I looked around; spectators were starting to line the enclosure, cheering on either Hans or myself.\nAt least I didn\u2019t spot anyone else with a blue flag. Hans and I were the last ones left. All I had to do for my wish was beat him. But that was the tricky part, wasn\u2019t it?\nHans slipped the Swiss Army knife into his sleeve and pulled out another knife, long and wicked and with an emerald-green hilt. The blade alone was as long as my forearm, and jagged near the hilt, like it was meant to be shoved in all the way and then ripped out.\nThe elf-lady strode to the railing of her private stand. \u201cThe final challenge will take place between the Blueberry Knight and the Roving Dagger,\u201d she said. The growing crowd responded with an assortment of cheers and oohs, and leaned forward to get a better look at us.\nWhy was I not at all surprised that Hans had a title like that?\nHe soaked it in. He took off his hat to reveal a head of pale silver-blond curls, and bowed like a dandy prince in my direction. Then he spun on his toes (he moved so easily! What, did he slick the bottom of his boots with butter, too? Or was this all his magic?) and bowed again to the crowd. The cheering grew. It looked like he had a reputation.\nThen he turned his gaze back on me, and drew close. \u201cNo knife of your own?\u201d he asked in a voice like frostbite.\nI glared at him.\nHis dagger flicked like a snake\u2019s tongue, and a thin line of pain ran over my cheek. I reached up and felt the sting of an open wound and the warm stickiness of blood. Several of the spectators crowed. I stepped back, pretty certain that I wasn\u2019t getting my brave face back anytime soon.\n\u201cDo you yield?\u201d he asked, running a finger over the edge of the knife.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\nHe danced past me. My hair stirred at the sudden movement of air, and a sharp pain in my ear told me he\u2019d nicked me there, too. I whirled to face him before he could get a clear shot at my back.\nHe cocked an eyebrow. He darted in close; I stepped back, barely dodging out of his reach, one arm protecting my belly. I did not want a dagger in my gut, especially not the one he held.\nMy back came up against the elf-lady\u2019s railing. She peered down at me, mouth slightly open so I got a good view of those creepy little cat-teeth.\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said, slightly annoyed, \u201cat least try to make this fight remotely interesting.\u201d And she reached down and held out a dagger, hilt-first.\nI took it and gave her a grateful smile, but she still looked annoyed and slipped out of view without another word.\nThe dagger she\u2019d given me was smooth and black and curved, like a crescent moon. Its edge was so thin it faded to transparency. I held it in front of me, trying to copy the way Hans held his.\nHe was still smiling. He jabbed cautiously at me, but I jumped aside and struck. I went wide, of course. But I wasn\u2019t out of the game yet.\nIf anything, his grin grew wider. He came at me at full tilt, aiming for my belly.\nHe would\u2019ve gotten me. But he tripped and lost his footing, and his arms flailed out in a ridiculous attempt at balance.\nIn that split second, I had two instincts: one, to hold out my hands and try to grab a person falling at me, and two, to duck down and get out of the way of the dagger sailing wild at my face. Those two instincts collided, and I ducked down and thrust my hands out in front of me\u2014and the curved black dagger slid into Hans\u2019s gut.\nHis eyes went wide; his fingers grasped at my sleeves as he slid to the grassy green. The crowd cheered.\nI felt sick. Not because I killed him\u2014the people here didn\u2019t die from a dagger in the belly, not in the way we\u2019d think\u2014but because I saw why he\u2019d tripped.\nThe curving loop of a vine, deep bruise-purple and bristling with thorns, retreated into the soft earth.\nHans curled up at my feet, defeated and still. He pressed a hand against his bleeding belly, and blood the color of an old scab oozed out between his pale fingers. I looked away, trying to hold down the contents of my stomach. A splatter of applause erupted from the shadowed stand, and the elf-lady strode forward.\n\u201cWonderful, marvelous!\u201d she squealed. \u201cCongratulations, Blueberry Knight. Myself and my lord are pleased beyond words. Now, step forward and receive your reward.\u201d\nMy heart skipped at the words \u2018my lord,\u2019 and not in the good way. I knew who her lord was, and I knew he\u2019d helped me, though I didn\u2019t know why and I didn\u2019t want to find out. Still, I stepped forward. I couldn\u2019t lose my chance at a wish, no matter who it came from.\nBehind the elf-lady and her washed-out pageboy, the shadows thickened and then parted, and the Prince of Thorns stepped forward to greet me.\n* * *\nI can\u2019t convey how sick and awful I felt, seeing him again. My nose was stuffed with the smell of sickly-sweet vegetation, my ears were clogged with the sound of beating wings and the cries of crows. The Prince of Thorns had a thing for crows. His castle bristled with them. That\u2019s why it was his parting shot to turn my brother into a murder of them, as if to say, \u201cYou may have gotten away, but you\u2019ll always be one of mine.\u201d\nI wanted to walk right up to him and slap him in the face. But even politely standing there in his purple and black velvets and silver buttons, smiling as if he\u2019d just run into a friend at the supermarket, he was too terrifying to approach. If I tried to attack him, I\u2019d be dead before anything connected. His thorns could move faster than Hans\u2019s dagger. I knew. I had watched them feed.\nThe girlish elf-lady giggled and slipped her arm into his, leaning against his side like some blushing bride. She wasn\u2019t some two-thousand-year-old magical princess, I realized with another sick jolt. She was a girl like me, and she\u2019d been stolen away to the prince\u2019s castle to be his replacement bride. But unlike me, she\u2019d given in to his charms and promises. And his power had warped her into the cat-fanged little goblin she was. I wondered if anyone had tried to rescue her.\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the Prince of Thorns, \u201cthe Blueberry Knight.\u201d He seemed to chew on the title, tasting it, matching it to my new appearance. He gave no public hint that we\u2019d met before, but I saw the sharp glint in his eyes\u2014a malicious glee meant only for me. \u201cWhispers of your skills have already reached us. And you have handily won the day, it seems!\u201d\nThe ground rumbled. I glanced back to see the unconscious Hans grasped by blind, feeling vines. Foot-long thorns pierced his skin, and he jerked back into semiconsciousness just in time to let loose a choking scream as they dragged him into the heaving black earth. I looked away until the sound cut off and the green was still.\nPeople here didn\u2019t die easily. Not unless you found their core, their heart, and destroyed it. Dragged underground and ripped apart by thorns, Hans the Roving Dagger wouldn\u2019t die\u2014he would just change. Willing or no, he was under the power of the Prince of Thorns now.\n\u201cTell me, brave lady knight,\u201d said the prince, in a tone that got under my skin like sharp nails, \u201cwhat is it you wish for your reward?\u201d He smiled, and his teeth were blazing white.\nMy fingers curled into fists. \u201cI want my brother, Crowsbody, restored to his rightful form,\u201d I said, looking him straight in the eyes as I said it.\nBeyond the lift of one perfect plucked eyebrow, the prince didn\u2019t react. The little princess on his arm snorted, but in that way that said she wanted to get in on the winning side of the mockery but wasn\u2019t sure what the joke was about.\nBut then the prince smiled and spread his hands in this big public show of generosity, and said, \u201cI believe that can be arranged.\u201d Next to me on the green, thick thorny vines shot from the ground and clumped and wove together into a huge carriage, and a pair of crows landed in front of it and morphed into tall black horses. But it was a carriage out of Cinderella\u2019s nightmares, and the crows obviously didn\u2019t know what horses looked like, because their heaving sides still sprouted the feathered stubs of vestigial wings, and their heads were freak-show crow heads that snapped their beaks on silver bits.\nWith his princess still clinging to his arm and smiling with her sharp little cat-teeth, the Prince of Thorns stepped from the stand and gestured for me to join them in the carriage. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cI know where you may find his human bones. Once they are joined together, Crowsbody will be restored.\u201d\n\u201cMy wish doesn\u2019t involve me going with you,\u201d I said. Sasha had drawn near and I slipped my fingers into the fur between her ears. I felt a little better knowing she was there.\nThe prince laughed. \u201cOh, no need to be shy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trip will bring you no harm. You are our guest! Besides, it is within my power to show you where the bones are interred. It is not in my power, however, to join them again.\u201d\nThe ghostly pageboy held the door open for me. I frowned at him, and at the prince. I wasn\u2019t going to trust them as far as I could throw them. Sasha growled, but the crow-horses snapped at her with a God-awful shriek, like a cross between a loud caw and a horse\u2019s whinny. She backed away and eyed me through her bangs.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said to the prince, patting Sasha on the head, \u201cbut I already have a mount. I\u2019ll ride behind you.\u201d\nThe prince hesitated only an instant, then smiled graciously. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, and helped his princess into the carriage before following her inside.\nThe pageboy shut the door after them and climbed up into the driver\u2019s seat. He whipped the horse-crows forward with a loud crack, and they responded with more of their terrible shrieks. The carriage rolled into motion. I climbed onto Sasha\u2019s back and gave her a reassuring scratch as we followed the carriage to the house of my enemy.\n* * *\nThe Dark Lands slid by in a panorama of shadowy woods, ashy fields, and finally brown, craggy mountains sharp as broken bottles. At the top, just as the air started to turn thin and cold, Thornhold erupted from the rock in a jumble of spiteful black spires and corpse-gray stones. Crows swarmed around the towers in roiling clouds and dotted the walls like a plague.\nMy heart twisted and shrank. I don\u2019t even know how the Prince of Thorns had once convinced me that this was some kind of paradise. No homework or parents or irritating big brother, just exploring a fantastic castle all day long and being waited on by servants and wooed by a handsome prince, and sitting in the smug knowledge that I was magical now, that I was somehow above it all.\nBut this? This sharp barrenness, this high-and-mighty loneliness? If being the Princess of Thorns meant becoming that mean-eyed bundle of lace and poisoned sugar in the carriage ahead of me, then I\u2019d been unbelievably lucky to come to my senses in time, and to have a brother like Elliot risk everything to get me back. Just in time, too, before I\u2019d been unlucky enough to eat anything and been stuck here forever.\nWe passed under the portcullis, which dropped behind us with the solemn ringing of a funeral bell. The carriage rode through the courtyard, where a garden full of\u2014you guessed it\u2014nettles and briars and thorny rose bushes burst out of the ground in long trails and tall, painful clumps. I could swear they twitched and reached for me as I passed.\nThat\u2019s another thing about the people here: they\u2019re not very creative. Give them a theme and they\u2019ll run it into the ground.\nThe carriage rolled to a stop. The prince took his sweet time getting out, letting his princess down as if she were some delicate bubble. The pageboy drifted from the driver\u2019s seat and shut the carriage door after them with the dead-eyed expression of someone who couldn\u2019t think of anything better to do; the carriage dissolved into loose vines that wriggled and scrambled into the garden\u2019s dark earth. The crow-horses turned back into proper birds and flew off.\nCharming.\nI was led inside to a passageway I had never explored during my last stay\u2014or maybe he\u2019d remodeled since then. It was dark, and the gray pageboy walked ahead of us carrying a lamp with a sickly little flame inside, which made him look even more transparent. The princess clung to the prince\u2019s arm with a fierce grip, as if she\u2019d been grafted onto him. Either she was desperate, or desperately trying to make me jealous. Her fingernails were painted the same garish purple as her dress.\nWe stopped at a tall, black wooden door. The pageboy unlocked it and led us inside to a long, thin stairway that soared down into the darkness in a bone-white arc. He drifted down the stairs and we followed until the pale light reached the bottom, revealing a pile of bones. More pale flames flicked into life around the room, which extended away from the stairs in a wide circle. Tiny things I couldn\u2019t identify skittered and squirmed away from the light.\nThe room was a sea of bones.\nIt must\u2019ve been three times the size of my school gymnasium, but the deep shadows and the faraway ceiling made it feel much bigger. It could\u2019ve stretched on forever. I didn\u2019t even know if there was a floor somewhere under all the bones; the stairs just dove right into them, and I didn\u2019t want to guess how much deeper it went.\nThe Prince and Princess of Thorns slipped behind me on the stairs, blocking the exit. The pageboy stepped aside and gestured me forward into the bonepile.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Prince of Thorns, smiling, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s around here somewhere. Good luck!\u201d\nThe princess tittered and tossed me a look I wanted to slap off her face, then flounced around on the stairs and began the long climb back up. The prince said nothing more, and followed her.\nI said every word I couldn\u2019t get away with saying at the dinner table, and stepped onto the pile of bones. Something snapped underfoot. I groaned.\nBut with my second step, a warm tingling shot up from my toe straight to my chest and bloomed there, and I thought of Elliot. I looked down and found a small knucklebone beneath the toe of my sneaker. It stuck out from all the other bones. Not visibly, not by glowing or being whiter or newer than the rest. But I knew, I just knew it belonged to my brother. It was a part of him.\nI picked it up, and the moment my fingers touched it I became certain. I slipped it into a pouch of my book bag.\nThe pageboy still lingered on the stairs, gazing straight ahead of him. Not like he had anything else to say, but like he needed to remember what he was supposed to do next.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I get any clues?\u201d I asked him, on the off chance that I might get lucky.\nHe slid his gaze in my direction, then over his shoulder, in the direction of his retreating master and mistress. Without another word or gesture or anything, he turned around and climbed after them, leaving me alone in a torchlit room full of bones.\n* * *\nTime in the Dark Lands doesn\u2019t move the way you\u2019d think. Days and nights, they can take as long as they want to. So when I say I was down there for a few days, picking through the bones for Elliot\u2019s remains, it could have been minutes or it could have been years.\nThe only marker I had was the pageboy, who came down once a day with a tray full of food. I didn\u2019t eat it, of course. I\u2019d packed enough food to last me at least a little while, and a couple of bottles of water, too. He\u2019d linger on the bottom step, staring straight ahead of him, and if I didn\u2019t come for the food after a few minutes, he would turn around and drift back upstairs and vanish into the light of the faraway door.\nI don\u2019t have to tell you I didn\u2019t have any luck. I picked up bone after bone and dropped them again. Besides that knucklebone (a teaser left by the prince, I\u2019m sure), not a single piece resonated with me, ringing in my head to tell me it belonged to Elliot. But I kept going, and whenever I thought about giving up, I\u2019d take the knucklebone out of my book bag and hold it for a few minutes, thinking of Elliot and his lopsided, dopey-big-brother smile. It was my turn to rescue him, and I couldn\u2019t give up now.\nI wasn\u2019t alone in the bone room. Remember those things I saw hiding from the light? Yeah, they were still there. Mice and spiders and snakes and things. I\u2019d\u2019ve royally freaked out about it, but it was painfully obvious they were terrified of me and kept away. But still I sometimes saw them at the edge of the light, rooting through the bones. I don\u2019t know what they expected to find down here, or what they ate. Every single bone was scraped clean and dry as dust.\nI was eating my lunch one day (a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a piece of jerky, some trail mix) when the pageboy wandered down with another meal I wouldn\u2019t eat. I think the Prince of Thorns was trying harder every day to tempt me into eating his food, because every day the pile of offerings grew. Today I could barely see the pageboy\u2019s face behind the bowls of huge, jewellike grapes and blocks of chocolate fudge and a whole roasted chicken.\nMy soggy PBJ looked, smelled, and probably tasted pretty pathetic next to that portable feast. But at least the PBJ was real.\nI looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches around here, do you?\u201d I asked. Not that I was expecting a response, but just to say something into the heavy silence.\nThe pageboy lowered the tray, looked at the sandwich in my hands, and blinked a little stupidly. I regretted having asked him. Some of these weaker fairies, they\u2019re so deep into their roles that if you try to talk to them about anything else they just bluescreen.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d I muttered.\n\u201cI . . . like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,\u201d said the pageboy, in a voice as thin and fragile as cobwebs.\nI nearly dropped my PBJ. \u201cYou do?\u201d I asked. I guess it was my turn to be stupid. I added, \u201cI didn\u2019t know they made them here.\u201d\nThe pageboy didn\u2019t answer for a long minute. Like he had to process the answer. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last, \u201cthey don\u2019t. Back home . . . Mom did. She . . . made them for me. I think.\u201d He frowned, as if remembering this fact required painful amounts of effort.\nMy jaw dropped. He was a stolen child, a changeling\u2014just like the Princess of Thorns. I looked at him, carefully this time, but there was hardly anything to him at all. He barely existed, like a ghost.\nI didn\u2019t have a lot of food. But seeing the way he stared at my sad PBJ, half confused and half desperate, I found myself cutting it in half with a plastic knife and holding the clean half up to him. \u201cDo you want some?\u201d I asked.\nAgain, he took his time to figure it out. But finally he set the tray down and took the oozing half-sandwich and ate it, holding it carefully between his gloved fingers. When he was done he stood blinking in the low light, his expression a mix of half-feelings, like he wasn\u2019t quite sure how to react. But he seemed to be a little less gray, a little more there.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, and fell silent again, gazing blankly ahead as if he\u2019d just reset.\nI wasn\u2019t gonna let this drop. \u201cHow did you end up here?\u201d I asked. I wondered what the Prince of Thorns had offered him, what wish he\u2019d had that the prince had convinced him he\u2019d fulfill.\nIt took him even longer to answer this question, and in the meantime he\u2019d picked up the tray of food and resumed his waiting-servant-pose on the bottom step. \u201cRen\u00e9e,\u201d he muttered at last. \u201cCame for . . . Ren\u00e9e.\u201d\nNow I did drop my sandwich. \u201cRen\u00e9e?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot the Princess of Thorns?\u201d\nHe squeezed his eyes shut and opened them wide again. Very slowly, he nodded. \u201cI came . . . to get my sister back.\u201d\nI leapt to my feet and grabbed him just below the shoulders. I wanted to stare him right in the face and see if this was some kind of deception, a trick sent by the Prince of Thorns. My hands sank half an inch into his cool, barely substantial arms. But there was no lie in his face, just vague misery. His fingers loosened, and the tray of food clattered off the steps and landed among the bones in an aromatic mess.\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t win, did you?\u201d I asked. And now the prince had the poor kid waiting hand and foot on his tittering, cat-goblin sister. Dangling his greatest wish two feet away from him, close enough to touch but always just out of reach. \u201cThat bastard! When I find all my brother\u2019s bones, I\u2014I\u2019ll do what I can to stop him!\u201d\nDon\u2019t ask me what I thought I would be able to do. He was a powerful fae of the Dark Lands, and I was just me, in a ridiculous hoodie with blueberries smiling over my trembling, terrified heart. But I wanted to do something. I couldn\u2019t allow this to stand.\nThe pageboy tilted his head. \u201cYou won\u2019t find your brother\u2019s bones,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThis is not a room for finding things. This is a room for forgetting things. The Prince of Thorns puts things here that he wishes to forget.\u201d He stared past my shoulder into the darkness. \u201cThey stay down here and he forgets about them. And . . . and they forget themselves, too, after a while.\u201d\nThe sound of skittering rose from the shadows. My spine shivered, as if the sound were crawling up my back. I let go of the pageboy and turned my attention to the mice and snakes and spiders that lurked at the edges of the room, nosing their way inside skulls and through ribcages, as if they too were searching for something they\u2019d lost but had forgotten what that thing was. An emerald-green snake lifted its head and regarded me, no bigger than the corn snakes Elliot used to catch and keep in an aquarium in his room. Its eyes were blue and human.\nI shuddered. I thought I would throw up. A mouse poking its way through an eye socket blinked at me, likewise, with tiny human eyes; I suspected the spiders had them too.\nEvery living thing in the room was a trapped person. How long had it taken them to forget themselves? Months, years? Centuries?\nNot even people truly died in the Dark Lands. They just changed.\nI whirled back to the pageboy. \u201cWhere are my brother\u2019s bones?\u201d I cried. \u201cThe Prince of Thorns promised me a wish, and he\u2019s obligated to grant it! That was the deal!\u201d\nThe pageboy trembled. His cheeks darkened to a pale rose\u2014the first spot of real color I\u2019d seen on him yet\u2014and he said, \u201cThe garden. They are in the garden.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. I grabbed my book bag and barreled up the stairs past him, all the way up and through the black door, and down the hallway till I reached a high-arched cloister that faced out into the courtyard. The garden was in the center of it all, a boiling mass of thorns erupting from black earth and grass the color of dark emeralds.\nI stepped gingerly out into the dull light of an overcast afternoon. High above me, the crows murmured to each other, circling lazily or nestled into little murders perched here and there on the turrets. I wondered how long it would take for the prince to find out I\u2019d left the bone room. I had to move fast. I was halfway to the garden when I heard something whining. There was Sasha on the other side of the courtyard, trapped in a cage, her head lolling dejectedly on her paws. She saw me, raised her head, and barked once, loudly.\nI put a finger to my lips and crossed the courtyard to her. She stuck her nose through the bars and I let her snuff at my palm. Her muzzle dropped open in a doggy smile. \u201cAre you all right, lady knight?\u201d she asked.\nI nodded. \u201cI think I might need your help, though,\u201d I said. \u201cHow good are you at finding bones?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she cried, a joyful bark in her voice, \u201cbones are a treasure and a delight!\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cHold on then,\u201d I said, looking around, \u201cI\u2019ll try to get you out. . . .\u201d But I couldn\u2019t find a lock on the cage, or even a hinge that suggested where it might open\n\u201cPlease,\u201d came a gray voice at my elbow, \u201cwill you let the dog out?\u201d\nThe iron bars twitched, and one side of the cage slid upward silently, just high enough for Sasha to crouch low and wriggle through.\nI turned. Behind me was the pageboy. Of course! He was the prince\u2019s all-purpose servant. The castle would listen to him. I flashed him a grateful smile.\nThe iron bars slammed down behind Sasha with a clang.\nThe crash echoed through the courtyard. The pageboy and I both jumped. The clouds of crows above my head burst into flight and began to swirl in a raw storm of croaks and caws and the beat of startled wings.\nI took that to be the alarm system. \u201cCome on!\u201d I said, and dashed for the garden. I didn\u2019t even know where to begin looking, but I let Sasha sniff the knucklebone and she put her nose to the ground. I looked for anything that resembled a shard of white in the dark soil.\nAn ear-piercing shriek rang out, dimming even the crows\u2019 noise for an instant. Ren\u00e9e, the Princess of Thorns, was stomping toward her brother across the courtyard. I ducked behind a bush.\nThe pageboy, her brother, crossed the courtyard to intercept her. She glared at him and sniffed.\n\u201cWill you tell those crows to be silent?\u201d she screeched, stomping her foot in time to her words. \u201cI can\u2019t hear myself think!\u201d\nThe pageboy blinked.\n\u201cOh, what good are you?\u201d she cried, waving a hand dismissively through the air. She\u2019d been in the castle too long, I could tell. Her once-purple manicured fingernails were now black and curved, like thorns growing from her fingertips. Sharp ears poked out from her honey-colored ringlets.\nThe pageboy said something, but he was too far away and his voice too quiet beneath the cacophony for me to hear what he said. But the princess slapped him, and he fell to the paving stones, as limp as a string-severed puppet.\nThe crows boiled, and the sky darkened with thunderheads as heavy and iron-gray as anvils. The wind that cut around the castle rose to a shriek. The Prince of Thorns stepped out of the air next to the girl, and looked down at the pageboy with narrowed eyes.\n\u201cWhat is the matter, my dear?\u201d he asked in a voice as smooth and cold as syrup from the fridge. \u201cHas this . . . thing . . . displeased you?\u201d\nEven from this distance, I could see the pageboy\u2019s slight coloring washing out again, even as the Prince of Thorns grew taller, more present, like all light was bending toward him.\nI looked around for something to wield as a weapon. And there it was, as if it had just been wished into existence: my Swiss Army knife, nestled in a tangle of briars. I picked it carefully out from among the leaves.\nThe briars twisted and wove together into a man-sized shape. I stepped back, unfolding the knife as I moved. The shape resolved into Hans\u2019s long, lanky body and his all-too-familiar face, formed entirely of thorny wooden vines like some mad topiary. His legs were a tangle that rooted him to the earth. He was not smiling.\nHoles opened in his face where his eyes should have been. \u201cThat\u2019s my knife,\u201d he growled.\nI took another step back. He swiped at me with an arm jagged with long, spiny thorns, but he was still rooted to the ground and I easily jumped out of his reach. A vine burst from the ground and curled around my ankle. I staggered, lost my balance, and fell.\nSomething warm and familiar tingled beneath the soil. I saw Elliot in my head, telling me to go on without him even as his body flaked away into clouds of ebony feathers and raw bird-cries.\n\u201cSasha!\u201d I cried. \u201cHere! Dig here!\u201d I severed the vine that clung to my ankle, climbed to my feet, and dashed away toward the center of the garden, hoping that Hans would go after me and let her do her work. And another idea was beginning to bud in my head. If Hans was rooted to the plants here, he would move more slowly, and I could defeat him if I cut him off. There had to be a central root ball, and I had a feeling it would be in the center of the garden, beneath the largest clump of briars I could see.\nIn the corner of my eye, I could see Hans\u2019s vines reaching for me. And I saw something else, too. The Prince of Thorns, still unaware of me, was picking up the pageboy by his collar and dangling him in the air. The boy was barely visible, more mist than person.\nI wished I\u2019d thought to ask him his name. I would have shouted it out to him, given him something to anchor himself with. But I hadn\u2019t asked. All I knew about him was that he liked\u2014\n\u201cPeanut butter and jelly sandwiches!\u201d I yelled. It was the strangest rallying cry in the world. I hoped it would work.\nThe Prince of Thorns saw me. But it was only for a split second, because the pageboy twitched and thickened into substance. One pale hand grabbed the prince\u2019s arm and wrenched his attention away from me.\n\u201cYou took my sister,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou took my sister. LET HER GO!\u201d\nHans was almost on top of me. I dove for the briar clump and dug my knife into its base, where the trunks met the soil. One thick, woody vine came loose. Hans cried out, and half his left arm went limp and fell away.\nThe briar clump was aware of me, too. The vines contracted around my hands, and thorns dug into my skin. Tears burned in my eyes and a scream rose in my throat, but I pressed my eyes shut and bit back the scream and pushed the knife further into the soil, just like Mom had taught me how to weed. You had to get the roots out.\nHans\u2019s scream withered behind me. The sky roiled and darkened further, as if the sun had just decided to give up and set. I shoved harder\u2014and thick, black fluid welled up from the soil.\nA high-pitched wail rose from somewhere in the courtyard, a sound I didn\u2019t recognize. It cut off just as suddenly, and the briar clump parted and the Prince of Thorns stepped out in front of me.\nHis face was pale. Not that elegant-powdered-princely pale, but ashen and sharp-angled. His eyes flicked down at me, with my lacerated hands still wrist-deep in the sticky soil. A shaky smile spread across his purple-gray lips.\n\u201cBlueberry Knight,\u201d he said, in a soothing whine, \u201cthere is no need for this. I will give you your brother\u2019s bones if you wish. I will give you anything you want.\u201d His soft, cool fingers brushed along my cheek. My heart cringed. My whole body tingled with goose bumps, and my throat tightened into a knot. I hated how handsome and hurt he looked. \u201cAll you need to do is let go of the knife. And I will give you everything.\u201d\nThe vines still cut into my flesh. But as long as I didn\u2019t pull, as long as I didn\u2019t struggle, the pain was held back in stasis. A soothing coolness filled my hands. All I had to do was not fight back.\nI looked down at the smiling blueberries and their incongruous \u201cHappy Day.\u201d I wondered who had given the hoodie to me. I wondered if it had been Elliot. My eyes drifted up to the Prince of Thorns, who was handsome and hurt and helpless, and utterly lying with every fiber of his being.\n\u201cForget you,\u201d I said, and drove the knife all the way down, straight into the source of his blood.\nThe people here don\u2019t die easily. Not unless you find their heart and destroy it.\nHe opened his mouth, but he didn\u2019t scream. The crows did, however: one single resounding shriek before they blew away like ash on the wind. A loud sharp boom nearly split my eardrums, like the stone castle had cracked right down the middle. The Prince of Thorns turned gray, withered, and curled up like a starved stem. The sun came back, and when its light hit the courtyard and the garden with its shriveled briars, the prince was gone, a shadow burned away in the daylight.\nGingerly I pulled my hands from the thorny vines and staggered towards Sasha. She lifted her head from a hole she\u2019d been digging\u2014a hole full of bones\u2014and padded forward to lick the dirt and blood from my hands. Beyond the grassy edge of the garden, Ren\u00e9e had collapsed in a cloud of purple lace and satin, and the pageboy\u2014still gray, but fully solid\u2014was staggering to his feet beside her. I gave him a minute to see to his sister first, to make sure she wasn\u2019t dead or anything, and when he came to me at last I told him I had a first aid kit in my book bag.\n\u201cIs she okay?\u201d I asked, thrusting my chin in his sister\u2019s direction as he bandaged my fingers and my scraped palms.\nHe nodded. \u201cUnconscious, stunned I think. But I think she\u2019ll recover.\u201d He winced. \u201cShe won\u2019t be very happy.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll get over it,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd when that day comes, she\u2019ll know you were there to stick up for her.\u201d\nHe ducked his head and blushed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without your help,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back with me, right? We can get you home, back to your family. . . .\u201d I trailed off at the tragic look on his face.\n\u201cShe\u2019s already eaten the food here,\u201d he said, not looking me in the eye. \u201cAnd so have I.\u201d\n\u201cOh. . . .\u201d\nSasha nosed up to him and whined. He scratched her behind the ears. \u201cI think . . . I think I\u2019ll stay here. The castle listens to me, and maybe I can help the others still in the bone room. Help them remember who they were.\u201d\nI forced a smile, but it was a sad smile and my heart felt like lead in my chest. \u201cSasha will take care of you, I\u2019m sure. Won\u2019t you, girl?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can make a home here.\u201d\nThe pageboy gave a shy and grateful smile. When he secured the last of my bandages, he leaned against Sasha a little, and I could tell they both appreciated the gesture.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, your real name?\u201d\nThe pageboy gave me that stunned, blank look and for a minute I was afraid he\u2019d forgotten it completely. But then he said, \u201cGary. My name\u2019s Gary.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, sticking out my hand, \u201cI won\u2019t forget you, Gary.\u201d\nHe shook my hand\u2014carefully, of course\u2014and smiled, really smiled, for the first time since I\u2019d met him. \u201cI won\u2019t forget you either.\u201d\nWe didn\u2019t talk much after that, not that we needed to. He gathered up all the bones that Sasha had dug up, and packed them carefully into a large satchel he found in one of the castle rooms. Sasha offered to take me back to the gateway home, and as she carried me over the drawbridge I turned and waved to Gary high up on the castle wall.\nIt\u2019s true, you know. I never did forget him.\n* * *\nElliot was waiting for me when I came out by the zombie tree. All the crows that made up \u2018him\u2019 were perched on its branches, and when the real world popped into focus, with the sun setting through the trees over the rise, he started up with such an irritated cawing that I could almost hear the words in it all. Where were you, what in God\u2019s name were you thinking, you could\u2019ve been stuck there, why didn\u2019t you tell me.\nWell, he is my big brother, he\u2019s supposed to be worried sick when I do something stupid. But he changed his tune when I told him I\u2019d brought him a present for his birthday, and opened the satchel to show him his own bones.\nWe hid them under his bed on a piece of tarp. It took me a couple of days to put them all together, with him supervising and with help from a couple of library books on human anatomy. But I finally fumbled the last knucklebone into place, and there was a bright glamour-glow and a shower of fairy glitter as all the crows of his false form burned up like flakes of fire and poured into the skeleton. You know, the usual pyrotechnics.\nAnd then my brother, in his real, true body, was lying on the tarp gasping breath into his lungs, feeling his arms and his face and grinning like a loon.\nNo, not like a loon. Not like any sort of bird. Like a dopey big brother. I hugged him, and he told me that I should never do anything that stupid again as long as I lived, and what a great little sister I was, and how he\u2019d never forget this.\nIt\u2019s true, you know. He never did forget.\nWe\u2019re still never gonna tell Mom, though.\nJennifer Hykes lives with her husband and two cats just outside of Pittsburgh.

Which one are you now? he will say, and she will draw her blue paisley shawl tighter around her shoulders and try to remember the names he has given them, for his convenience. She doesn\u2019t like the way they feel on her tongue\u2014like lumps of clay, or matchsticks.\n* * *\nThey have been married for just over a year. He is a real estate lawyer at a large firm. Their apartment looks down on the harried heart of the city he grew up in.\nIn the first months after the wedding, he would come home each Friday evening with a bouquet of daffodils clutched to his chest. She would let her teaching skin slip away and call another to the surface, a wide-eyed child who admired the flowers with innocent delight. She would pour water into a fluted glass vase and set it in the middle of the dining room table. While they ate, she would look up at the flowers with her chin in her hands and smile. But he would be troubled. Do you really like them? he would say. Or are you just pretending?\n* * *\nShe teaches introductory language courses at the community college. The program is new; her classes are in great demand. She is simplifying her syllabus considerably this year. The rudiments of her language give her students more trouble than she had expected.\nSometimes, while she is teaching, a face will appear in the long wire-reinforced window in the door, then vanish when she turns to look. Her students take photos with cell phones held underneath their desks. She doesn\u2019t understand it. As far as she can tell, she looks just like any of them.\n* * *\nHe says he isn\u2019t sure if all of them love him. She doesn\u2019t know how to answer him, and because she is in the skin that likes to read dictionaries for hours at a stretch, she stares at him unblinking and without particular sympathy. Of course not all of them love him. Some of them love him enough to leap from cliffs for him. Some of them love only themselves. At least one of them would like to pluck out his ribs and use them for drumsticks. Several can\u2019t stand the smell of his mouthwash, but so far the consensus is not to say anything about it.\n* * *\nOnly one of them loves apples. Today for many hours she has been the one who loves apples. He is surprised and pleased by her easy smile, her languid, sprawling posture in a chair. Some of them suspect that the one who loves apples is the one he really fell in love with.\n* * *\nWhen they met, he was a tourist. She was laying the candles along the path at the Ceremony of Twining Rivers. Normally a foreigner would not have been permitted inside the temple, but he was a close personal friend of the Minister of Doors, who had invited him. The minister wore his most formal skin and kept a hand on his friend\u2019s arm at all times.\nHe came up to her after the humming had ceased and they were allowed to open their eyes. A vault layered with gold leaf hung over their heads; she rested an easy hand on one of the pillars that supported it. She was in a skin of great spiritual ecstasy and bestowed upon him a smile like the beating of wings.\n* * *\nSometimes he comes into the kitchen and his voice falters in midsentence. When she asks, he says, Nothing. Sorry, I just didn\u2019t recognize you at first. This troubles her. She grows new skins like branching twigs, but she is always the same tree. She doesn\u2019t know why it alarms him so.\n* * *\nThey don\u2019t look so different from each other, except for how they do. They stand differently. One of them always clasps her hands behind her back; one of them never stays still for more than a minute, her foot jiggling impatiently when she sits. They like to wear different colors. Some of them paint their faces with significant patterns or write words on their hands or hide their eyes beneath the shade of wide-brimmed hats. One of them keeps trying to dye her hair bright green, but the others can usually stop her in time.\n* * *\nI don\u2019t mind at all, he said. There\u2019s so much to learn about you. You know how many men would love to marry a bunch of different women at once? I\u2019ll never get bored. At the time, she was the one who could swim like a seal. She nestled closer to his side and sleepily nuzzled his ear.\n* * *\nSomething has been troubling her lately. She is finding it harder to shift out of certain skins. They aren\u2019t the ones she likes best. They are hard and irritable and unconcerned with the feelings of others. One of them eats burnt toast. One of them almost kicks a toy poodle that a silver-haired man is taking for a walk. The poodle is the tipping point. After the man and poodle have passed, she runs back into the apartment and slams the door, leaning her back against it. She runs her fingers through her hair. This has never happened to her before. She isn\u2019t sure what to do.\n* * *\nDon\u2019t go, her sisters told her. They were reclining on couches that smelled of freshly mown grass, eating the first berries of the summer. You deserve more than a man with just one face. There are plenty of good men here, and women too. The one who laughs loudly at rude jokes stuffed her mouth with berries and ignored them. The juice stained her lips purple, and she licked it off. I like him, she said with a coy smile. I like his one face.\n* * *\nShe has never mentioned the one who once ate a raw squirrel to him. That one hasn\u2019t been out in a long time, anyway. She isn\u2019t sure, but she thinks it might upset him.\n* * *\nToday she has failed at social niceties. Their next-door neighbor is an old man and lives alone; she was not supposed to stare coolly at the door to their apartment and then disappear inside without speaking to him. She was supposed to smile and offer to help carry groceries.\nHer husband will not let it go. I can\u2019t believe you did that, he keeps saying. She turns her back to him and clenches her fists before the squirrel-eater can leap out and knock him to the ground. It wants very badly to gnaw on his neck. The others pacify it by smashing a lamp on the floor. He backs away from her with an affronted look. Where I come from, he says, adults don\u2019t do things like that.\nShe turns her face away to hide her laughter. Some of her are not adults.\n* * *\nShe remembers the first time she left the apartment alone to buy eggs at the market. People stared at her strange eyes, her strange clothes. The long draperies of patterned silk stood out like a beacon in the crowd. The hems trail in the dirt, here. She scrubs the mud out every night by hand. But the attention doesn\u2019t bother her as much as it used to. When she goes out now, she wears a skin of icy, exalted indifference.\n* * *\nHer back is against the bedroom door, her face wet. She reaches for the comforting skin that makes her think of sinking into down pillows, but it isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s like leaning on a wall that\u2019s farther away than she expects. She gropes around and finds two more blank spots, gaping holes with ragged edges, like moth-eaten fabric.\n* * *\nHe is always wanting something. But some of them have more important things on their minds. Some of them have to protect themselves. Why can\u2019t you just, he says.\n* * *\nHe took her hand and kissed it. He asked her to come with him, and she said, Yes, I will. At the time, she was the one who could diagram the flights of birds, but that wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted to see more of the world. She felt large inside, like a milkweed pod before it scatters its seeds.\n* * *\nNow she is full of empty places. She has to splinter her existing skins to fill them. The skins become more specific but less nuanced, narrower in scope. The one who likes to read dictionaries used to enjoy crocheting as well, but now she has forgotten how.\n* * *\nHe goes straight into the bedroom without speaking to her. If she follows him and asks, he will be angry with her; can\u2019t she see that he wants to be left alone? He will slam his briefcase down on the dresser, scattering her perfume bottles. Why doesn\u2019t she understand? If she doesn\u2019t ask, she will be self-absorbed and cruel; he should have known better than to marry her in the first place. Did she ever care about him at all? She tries to shift to the one who laughs at rude jokes, but she isn\u2019t there. She gropes through emptiness and feels herself falling.\n* * *\nEverything is vertigo. She is shedding skins like ash. She wakes up and stares at the sun rising over the grubby rooftops and can\u2019t remember who she is. She doesn\u2019t know who she wants to be. She tries to be someone else, but she can\u2019t find her when she looks. Finally she puts someone on like a mask and goes about her daily routine. He doesn\u2019t notice the difference.\n* * *\nShe has even lost the one who loves apples.\n* * *\nHe is not home. He will be home soon. Roast lamb is in the oven. She is tired of fighting. It is as good a time as any. She closes the oven door. She shuts her eyes and takes a deep breath, then drops her shoulders and releases it. A tide has been battering at her and now all she has to do is let go, and the water comes flooding in. In the water all the colors bleed, diluted, red and orange and purple and blue all swirling together until there\u2019s nothing left but a murky grayish brown. But it isn\u2019t so bad, really. She doesn\u2019t know why she fought it for so long. She lets the water close over her head.\n* * *\nShe sits patiently on the sofa with her hands clasped in her lap. He comes in with his briefcase and a bouquet of daffodils. He lays the flowers on the coffee table. Their cellophane wrapper rustles, and she smiles. When he asks her if she loves him, she looks up at him in perfect contentment. Yes, she says, completely.\nLydia Waldman grew up in Rochester, NY, and currently lives in Philadelphia.

The detective is interrogating a suspect. The high school girls are bitching about some other high school girls. The high school girl detective is bitching at a suspect. The vampires are brooding sexily. This is all first-act stuff, I don\u2019t pay much attention to it. The dialogue is bad. I\u2019m waiting for the story beats to catch up, for the good stuff.\nMy friend Farai and I get high by watching faces on TV together. I forgot he was here for a second. He\u2019s bitching at me now, like a high school girl detective. He wants the remote. He wants to skip between shows faster. I like a slow burn.\n\u201cShut up, Farai,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMy TV, my rules.\u201d\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s my TV,\u201d Farai objects, like he always does.\n\u201cNot when I\u2019m here.\u201d\n* * *\nFarai is one of those guys who will never amount to anything. His dada tells him so, and he believes it, and I believe him when he tells me. He flunked out of school in a fit of nihilism and is caught in a trap of existential, Lovecraftian dread which he can only survive by making sure his life is too pathetic not to be subject to judgement.\n* * *\nWhen we\u2019re high and watching faces on TV, when we hit slomo, when we\u2019re paying attention, everything is naked before us. Every little tic is blatant. Mid-interrogation, the detective\u2019s stern face flickers to embarrassment for a quarter-second.\n\u201cShe\u2019s remembered she left the tap on,\u201d Farai crows. His eyes flicker, oversized, in imitation. \u201cThe apartment will be flooded when she gets home.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s remembered she\u2019s a D-list actress,\u201d I say, \u201con the third-worst police procedural on TV. That was shame.\u201d\n\u201cShe wanted to be an astronaut when she grew up,\u201d Farai says.\n* * *\nThe detective is chasing a suspect around an anonymous urban neighbourhood. The high school girls are organizing a school dance at which there will be a dramatic denouement later on.\n\u201cChekhov\u2019s Prom,\u201d I say, pointing at it. Farai laughs himself into a coughing fit. The room\u2019s full of smoke. I\u2019d open a window but the second acts are on.\n* * *\nWhen Farai\u2019s mama was a teenager, she once told him (and he told me), she had wanted to be a stewardess. She thought that was cool and glamourous. When Farai was a kid he wanted to be a rapper. Neither of us understood the stewardess thing until they made retro TV shows glamourizing the old days when you could smoke on planes.\n* * *\nWe don\u2019t get high watching great actors. It\u2019s the bad actors we want, saying their lines in quiet desperation, contorting their faces into clumsy approximations of emotion. We count the anxieties in their eyes, in their wrinkles, in their twitches, in the compulsive tightenings in the jaws and foreheads.\nTheir real anxieties, I mean, not the ones they\u2019re ineptly pretending to have. Their jagged, unstable lives, their families, their homes, their debts, their obligations, their shame and public humiliations.\nThe brooding sexy vampires and the tiny penises they\u2019re secretly ashamed of, the furtive eBay orders for pumps and suspicious enlargement pills.\nThe too-old-for-it men and women playing high school boys and girls, their fake foghorn youth.\nThe detective, who clearly has real problems on her mind\u2014loveless marriage? sick kids? credit card debt?\u2014as she tries to make it seem authentic that she would sacrifice peripheral vision during a chase scene just to have perfectly coiffed hair. How did her life come to this? Didn\u2019t she believe in art, once? Wasn\u2019t she going to be a star?\nThis is what we love. All that truly authentic human emotion you can only see on a bad actor\u2019s face.\n* * *\nThe detective has solved the murder. It was the third suspicious guy introduced at the beginning of the episode, not the second one\u2014a surprise twist! The detective\u2019s lips tighten, too grim for someone who\u2019s just solved a murder and saved the day.\n\u201cNext year I\u2019ll hold out for a better gig,\u201d Farai whispers softly. He does the voice of wistful regret too often. It\u2019s annoying.\n\u201cNext year I\u2019ll do some art house films.\u201d I match his tone, obligingly. I\u2019m imitating his expression, not the detective. \u201cPay off my credit card, get better kids\u2014\u201d\nFarai glares at me. He acts like he wants me to take the game seriously, and it makes me laugh.\n* * *\nI watch Farai sometimes instead of the screen, watching the working of his jaw. I know he\u2019s thinking about what his dada said last week about how he\u2019s a grown-ass man now and needs to get a fucking job and stop whining about the economy.\nWhen he laughs at something on TV, it\u2019s a little too high-pitched, like a drowning rat being held just below the waterline, and I can almost feel the water sloshing around my hands, wetting my sleeves.\n* * *\nThe high school girl detective solved the episode\u2019s case with the greatest of ease, but the season arc got way more complicated. She\u2019s juggling up to five potential romantic interests. She\u2019s still young enough to consider this job a step up. Farai and I watch the quirky, knowing grin she wraps around those perfect quips. Her lower lip is very shiny when she bites it.\n\u201cThis face I\u2019m making right now will go viral,\u201d I say.\n\u201cGIF me, fandoms,\u201d Farai says. \u201cGIF me now and forever until the hour of my death.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I say. \u201cShe\u2019ll never die.\u201d\n\u201cThe petit mort of cancellation.\u201d Farai gestures. \u201cI give her another season, max.\u201d\n* * *\nIf we were a TV show, Farai says, I\u2019d be his imaginary ghost friend that only he can see. Charming at first, but increasingly creepy.\n\u201cDada would say I need to grow up,\u201d Farai adds, \u201cand we\u2019d have a scene where I storm off. Everybody thinks I\u2019m crazy, except the audience. No, maybe even the audience.\u201d\n\u201cThen I kill you in the finale,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then I wear your face as a hat.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s way too dark for network TV,\u201d Farai says. \u201cAre we on cable?\u201d\n* * *\nThe vampires are doing a low-budget bottle episode. It\u2019s terrible and wonderful. We think they have real tears in their eyes.\n\u201cOh, for the day when they can Photoshop in the teeth,\u201d I intone. \u201cThese prosthetics, they hurt me so.\u201d\nThe bad actors are pretending to cry and are summoning up sad thoughts like their acting coaches told them in workshop. There\u2019s always one or two that inadvertently summon up demons worse than they intended. Oh, those absent parents, those early heartbreaks, the cruel things we\u2019ve said to the ones we loved, the hollow disappointment of this role. This is the crowning glory of the game, the perfect storm of inauthenticity.\nWhen it happens, Farai and I end up with our arms around the TV, sobbing along. My face is warm against the glow of the screen and I\u2019m squinting through my eyelashes because it\u2019s too bright.\n\u201cWell, that was cathartic,\u201d Farai says, eventually. The shows are over and we\u2019re both coming down. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand.\nI watch him, in slomo. His face is naked, tracked with tear trails.\n\u201cThat thing where you wipe your face with the back of your hand,\u201d I point out. \u201cYou learned that from TV, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNormal people do it like this.\u201d I demonstrate, using my fingers.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n* * *\nLater, I watch Farai sleep. Puffy clouds of breath in the cold. He doesn\u2019t like it when I watch him sleep, but it\u2019s my favourite of all the faces he wears. I like to curl up close while he sleeps. He\u2019s so warm.\nLater still, I go to the bathroom where I can switch the light on without his parents seeing. In the mirror I look at my face in slomo and I make my faces. I say my lines and I practice them.\n\u201cNormal people do it like this,\u201d I say, and I watch the crinkling where there\u2019ll never be crow\u2019s feet, and the shallow pools of terror in my eyes.\nVajra Chandrasekera lives in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Mum used to say that at me all the time when I\u2019d come in hot with the tinboots on my heels. She would cross her arms and ask what I had done. And I would say, because it was as true as I could be and keep a whole hide, that I\u2019d done nothing. And she\u2019d give that sigh like she was looking through me and say those seven little words.\nThey\u2019re lies, though. I don\u2019t think my mum did a bad thing in her life, and it didn\u2019t save her when the cops came gliding along the zip lines on their crisp metal shoes and shot up the laundromat she\u2019d been standing in. There had been a tip that drugs were falling out of the place like rain over the upper levels, and the damned tinboots hadn\u2019t missed a step. Rumor was the place was full of guns and some hot frags and dopers so why bother with subtlety, only they crossed a line somewhere and ended up at the wrong place, so instead of a den of slime they came down like a hammer on Mum and a family of four cleaning their underthings.\nI\u2019m standing in the belly of a sub-line bin, standing because things like seats have long ago been stripped out of the lowly sub-lines. There aren\u2019t even rails unless you\u2019re big and lucky and that\u2019s where the picks are waiting anyway, or the scanners with small pads that will lift the money right from your cards. So I\u2019m standing, legs braced, ready in case a sudden jolt sends me leaning into someone else, which is why the pervs hang out along the walls, hoping to get a feel.\nI get to Big Dive without having to pull a knife, though, and I\u2019m out of that bin the second the doors open and racing through the narrow confines to Holly\u2019s. Hol\u2019s the Ring of the area, the boss, the brains that keeps the lowlies like me alive and running. I\u2019ve been on snatches for the last week, managed to bank big at a few half-hoity hotels where the bag boys would take their eyes off cases of snobs they didn\u2019t like long enough for me to slip in and relieve them of some key trophies. I run in the front door and Hol\u2019s where she always is, behind an honest desk like this was a reception area.\nAround her, though, are the rest of the lot, Madge and Pie, Looper and Cut1, Cut2, and Cut3, and Mad Mumbles. Mumbles is raving as usual, voice like a bagpipe and just as intelligible.\n\u201cNothing, they say,\u201d Mumbles mumbles. \u201cNothing in and nothing out and nothing all the way between. And they wonder, I bet, why we take their leavings and try to choke them with it. Maybe if something in then something out and not all this nothing, nothing, nothing all over.\u201d\nThe others aren\u2019t paying mind but look up when I\u2019m in. Hol waits as I cross and put the small stack of cards on the desk, prepaid little darlings that we always deal in. She eyes me suspicious like and leans forward, reading the amounts on the cards. As soon as she does the math she\u2019s smiling.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to see, Non,\u201d she says, and I\u2019m beaming at the others. \u201cJust what I expect from one of my best.\u201d\n\u201cOne of nothing,\u201d I say, pouting. \u201cThe best. One and only.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d she says, leaning back, \u201cyou up for another job?\u201d\nI\u2019ve been hoping for some time down for a while, but the way she set me up I can\u2019t say no. Besides, maybe I\u2019m liking the way the others are all dismay and shame at what might be a coming promotion. I nod, and Hol hands me an address.\n\u201cGuy needs a runner,\u201d she says. \u201cTold him I have the best, and looks like I was right.\u201d\n\u201cJust a running?\u201d I say and quick memorize the address and then crumple it, drop it on the floor. \u201cWon\u2019t take but a moment, then.\u201d\nI\u2019ll be mighty when I return, I know, and that\u2019s something. Or, at the slimmest, not nothing.\n\u201cJust be sure to collect payment,\u201d Hol says. \u201cGuy\u2019s a bit of a nutter, but loaded full of wealth. Some political whack-a-mole. Get it done and there\u2019s a two-day pleasure dock for you.\u201d\nI keep the excited yell from exploding from my mouth, but I beam all the same and turn to the others and give a wink and then am gone out the door and back into the endless twists of Big Dive. A two-day in the pleasure docks is extravagant, more than Holly ever offers. Means the job is sketch at best, but also that she wants to show she glories good work, and I\u2019ve been working hard. Still, a two-day in the lavish pleasure docks, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve fantasized about since turning sixteen last year and being officially of age.\nI race the runs of Big Dive, staying away from the darkest streets and territories that Holly doesn\u2019t deal with. Most places it\u2019s all understood who can be touched and who is above. It\u2019s life in Big Dive, in all the lower levels. Maybe upside, where they say the rains never stop, it\u2019s different. Maybe there there\u2019s no need for hand signs and brands that say who you run for, but I\u2019ve never been topside, never even saw the sky but in the adverts at the half-hoity boutiques and clothiers.\nThe address turns out to be a track den, a place with nothing but screens showing bot races and crawler races and human races and every other sort of race. Not a nice place, filled with jittering chance junkies, but the security is tops. I hand over my knife at the door and let myself be patted down by a woman looks could break me in half on her knee. Still, good to know they\u2019re thorough, and then I\u2019m inside and flashing the brand on my shoulder, knowing that anyone looking for me would know to look for Hol\u2019s mark.\nIt takes only a moment for a tall guy to slide over. I\u2019m half-shocked at how nice his clothes are, a full white suit and tie and hat that look untouched by the dirt of Big Dive. He wears glasses low on his nose like he doesn\u2019t need them to see and I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re really tech, because even as he approaches me he seems distracted by something else. He\u2019s full hoity, full dangerous because people like that only come down to Big Dive to play at illegals.\n\u201cYou the runner?\u201d he asks, eyes staring at me through his tech. I nod, not really wanting to talk. He doesn\u2019t smell right, doesn\u2019t walk like one accustomed to the crowd, like he\u2019s just drugged himself to be able to stand the wash of everyone around him. I want to bolt but am feeling too good from Hol\u2019s trust and from the promise of my two-day to cut out.\n\u201cAre you familiar with the Severance Concession?\u201d The way he says it takes me a few blinks to realize he means Mercy. But I remember from back when Mum would talk about it that it\u2019s called the Severance Concession to some. It\u2019s charity, or just about, a place where everyone goes to collect their Mercy, their help from the government. Part of the treaty back before I was little to make the powers that be pay for losing the Last Great War.\nI nod again. Everyone knows Mercy, needs the extra credit to float, to mention nothing about the medicine, the contraceptives, the vaccines. Without it Big Dive would be a roil with trouble so dark even the gangs wouldn\u2019t be able to cut out of it. The man smiles at just the corners of his mouth, and I wish I could shove a knife into his gut to make it stop but I\u2019m afraid it wouldn\u2019t do a thing, that he\u2019d just smile a bit brighter.\n\u201cI need a package delivered there,\u201d he says. \u201cMost urgent. It\u2019s electronic. I need you to swipe it directly into the main terminal. That should do it.\u201d I hold out my hand, but he waits. \u201cRepeat what I told you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m to take your package to the main terminal of . . . the Severance Concession and swipe it in.\u201d\n\u201cJust so,\u201d he says, and pulls out a small electronic pad, a storage device most like. Bulky, too, which is sketch from the start, but I just keep my hand there while he gives me the device. \u201cNothing to it.\u201d And that smile inches up a tick.\nI wait then, hand still out, knowing that Holly would flip and cancel my two-day if I blow it about payment. The man looks at me like he was expecting me to forget, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small stack of cards.\n\u201cThey\u2019re locked until the job is verified complete,\u201d he says, which is as much to say it\u2019s up to him if we get paid.\nI could argue, and Hol will be pissing blood if it turns out that he\u2019s pulling a con, but he looks like the money isn\u2019t the deal, like he could care less. I don\u2019t bother counting the cards, just shove it all into my pocket and head back to the door to retrieve my knife. I don\u2019t look back but I can feel his eyes on me the whole way until I\u2019m clear of the track den and then I\u2019m running as fast as my legs will carry.\nMercy\u2019s always a press, any time of day. Lots of the people in Big Dive and other districts in the lower levels don\u2019t have much in the way of work, not since the Last Great War wrecked so much. And we all know that the government wouldn\u2019t have agreed to Mercy at all if it hadn\u2019t been demanded by the treaty. Losing a war had a way of putting the powers that be behind an eight ball, and they were quick to try and prove that the abuses of the past were in the past. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean they liked it.\nSo each person has a day and hour that they have to arrive to collect their Mercy. Miss it, and miss your cards and meds for that week. No exceptions for work, for sickness, for anything. And the powers that be are always trying to make it more difficult, to make it so that more people can\u2019t qualify. But all the same Mercy is always full, and I\u2019m pushing my way to the center, to the main terminal. To my side a family of six is huddled, a girl about the age I was when my mum died standing watch over everyone else. She\u2019s fierce, eyes threatening knives at anyone who lingers, but I can see the slight shake of her hands. I know it.\nA blink later and she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m getting ready. But something doesn\u2019t feel right. The man in white, the job in general, it all stinks. He can\u2019t have business in Mercy, not someone like him. It\u2019s only meant for the lowlies, and he was definitely not lowly. I start asking myself why he\u2019d ask a delivery at Mercy, and none of the answers are good. And even now I can see tinboots lurking, watching the crowd. There seems more than normal, and all of them looking around as if waiting for something.\nThe more I wait the more I know I need numbers on the situation, hard data. It\u2019s like I can taste the man in white\u2019s disdain for me, so sure he is that I\u2019ll just run the job and get the money. But there are some things not even Hol would want me messing with. If not for Mercy . . . well, I know things are bad, but they could be a lot worse.\nI cut out, bringing the tech with me. Late is still done, I tell myself, knowing that the man and that Hol would be screaming red death at me but not caring. I\u2019ve never been the best at listening. I skip a few ways over to Dana\u2019s, knowing that if anyone can shed clear on this, it\u2019s her. Dana\u2019s a whiz, a hack, a tech fiend. She can crack anything, and all I want to know is what the man gave me. If it\u2019s safe, or even a little crooked, fine, I\u2019ll go ahead with the run, but something tells me I need to check.\nShe\u2019s sitting just inside of her little storefront when I skid to a halt, the proximity of the tinboots giving my step a little extra go. The shop looks all junk and it is, just stuff from long ago that people might use to line a bookshelf to look posh. It\u2019s a front for her real talent, which is information.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got the wind in you today?\u201d Dana asks, and I set down the tech on the table beside her. Normally we\u2019d haggle cards, but she owes me for a job a few months back and I cash in.\n\u201cNeed to know what this does,\u201d I say. I hope it\u2019s just a snatch or a skim. Something like that, the government would inquire and poke around but would still have to shell out to us lowlies, write it off. Dana looks at the tech and shrugs, takes it and sets it up on her scanner. She brings up a screen and things are moving on it. Her eyes go wide.\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get this little devil?\u201d she asks, and I can tell it\u2019s not a skim.\n\u201cJob that didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d I say, and Dana nods.\n\u201cWell, small wonder. This . . . thing is chaos in a bottle. Takes information and screws it up to the eyeballs. No rhyme or reason. Can\u2019t even see the con. Pro stuff. Government, if I had to guess.\u201d\n\u201cGovernment?\u201d I squeak, and I remember what Hol said about the guy being political. That wrinkles things. \u201cWhat would the government do with something like that?\u201d\n\u201cInsert it into an organization they didn\u2019t like, probably. Zaps names and dates and everything else so that it would take months to fix.\u201d\nI gape. Months? With something the size of Mercy, with how little the powers that be cared about it working, it would be longer yet. And the lower levels cut off from their last lifeline. . . . I shudder, then swear up and down the wall. Means I can\u2019t set it loose in Mercy. Means no cards, no glory, and no two-day. I\u2019ll need to tell Hol about it, warn her about the guy, tell her to put the word out. I take the cards from my pocket.\n\u201cAny way to get these unlocked?\u201d I ask, handing them over. \u201cA quarter of it\u2019s yours if you can.\u201d\nDana laughs, and that\u2019s when the first hail of bullets tears through the door and the wall, blazing through the merchandise and the furniture and Dana and everything. Somehow I\u2019m standing in the middle of it, untouched for the moment. Everything pauses for one red second, and then I\u2019m grabbing the tech and shoving it into my pocket and running speeder-fast to the back.\nTinboots are through the bullet-riddled door just as I\u2019m into the alley, and I can hear them calling for surrender, hands in the air, everything you never do because it would just mean ending up like Dana anyway.\nMy mantra as I run is I hope they didn\u2019t cover the back, and for once it pays, because as I bolt into the thin corridors behind the stores I don\u2019t see them. Probably burst right through the front without bothering caution, all tinboot rash and angry. Serves me, though I can\u2019t shake the sight of Dana falling in a haze of red. Another blink and I\u2019m lost enough to be safe, feet taking me by feel back toward Big Dive and Holly. She\u2019ll know what to do, because this has to be about the tech, about that man. No way Dana was big fish enough to warrant what fell on her.\nI almost run into a tinboot standing at a checkpoint as I crash out from the thin-ways and into a main street. I swear three shades of black over it and slow down. Cutting back would just make me look sketch, and I\u2019m pretty sure even if they have a description of me it won\u2019t help them. Skin somewhere between dark and light, hair black, clothes nothing to speak of. There\u2019s so many of me walking around I\u2019m sometimes surprised I can keep us apart. I approach the checkpoint and the tinboots look me over and demand ID. I pull a fake out and smile wide, the way that makes me invisible, and they look at me a moment, then wave me on.\nMaybe if they had tech like politico-man I\u2019d have worried, because then they could have had my name with a scan, but there\u2019s some benefit to the powers that be treating tinboots only a step better than the lowlies. They had to be kept hungry to be kept mean, and they were some of the meanest around.\nI still take longer getting back to Hol\u2019s than I should. After the first checkpoint I make sure I don\u2019t pass through a second, and even as I put Dana\u2019s behind me the tinboots don\u2019t thin. The thought worries me, because they can\u2019t be everywhere. If they\u2019re here, looking for me, then they might know where I\u2019m going. It puts more wind in my step.\nAs I get close I run through what I\u2019m going to say, lay it all down so that when Hol\u2019s looking death at me I\u2019ll have some defense. But then I\u2019m standing within sight of the door and I see the smoke, the two ranks of tinboots standing in the street. There are bodies there too, not all of them wearing gleaming metal shoes, though there are those as well.\nThe Cuts are all lined up, burly bodies like sacks of meat now, identifiable because of their size. Others being dragged from inside are harder to tell, but I can\u2019t suppress the squeaking sob that breaks through my mouth. And then I see a flash of white and recognize politico-man from the track den. He\u2019s there, leading the tinboots, gazing out over the death he has wrought. My eyes bulge and of course he looks my way, sees me standing there. Of course he recognizes me instant-like and smiles with just the corners of his mouth. And of course he points in my direction and a dozen tinboots raise their weapons.\nIt\u2019s not like the street\u2019s empty. There\u2019s a small gathering to see the carnage. But the tinboots don\u2019t seem to care, and I\u2019m stuck as I hear the crack of their guns. But the moment I think I\u2019m dead, as I watch the crowd surge back at the violence, I\u2019m airborne and there are hands on my shoulders. I\u2019m pulled into a thin-way, look up to see Mumbles staring at me.\n\u201cBe nothing now,\u201d Mumbles says, and shoves me farther from the street, though I can see he\u2019s not moving. \u201cBe nothing and get away, and show them what it means.\u201d\nThen he\u2019s running back out with a look of lucid purpose, the first time I\u2019ve ever seen it on him, and I\u2019m running the other way.\nThere are tunnels that lead into the maintenance ways near Hol\u2019s, though I doubt any friendlies managed to get to them. If the tinboots moved like at Dana\u2019s then everyone is dead and I\u2019m probably one step from joining them. I slip into the narrow vent, secure the grate behind me to leave no trace, and scurry into the darkness.\nIt\u2019s all wrong. Politco-man had to know there was a chance that I wouldn\u2019t do it, that I\u2019d cut out. He must have been watching, or had the tinboots watching, and called the kill the moment I cut out of Mercy. Or maybe this was the plan all along. He\u2019s here too fast, probably covering, erasing his part so that he can try again with something else. He\u2019s trying to make me nothing that will threaten him. But I\u2019m used to being nothing. I can work with that.\nWhat\u2019s even more clear is that he wants to start a war in the lower levels, wants an excuse to come down like a hammer, crush everything. I don\u2019t follow politics, never had to because we don\u2019t get a choice or voice down here anyway. But there must be big things at work topside. Whoever politico-man represents, it\u2019s death for me and mine.\nThen there\u2019s Mumbles\u2019s voice. Show them what it means to be nothing. Rosy, but how? Even if I knew, there\u2019s little I can do. I stop moving long enough to sit and search my pockets. Just the tech. I stare at it. Maybe if I could get it somewhere I could hurt him. If I knew his bank, or his party, or his anything. But he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the lower levels, and there\u2019s no way of me rising up.\nI curse the walls blue and back and want to crush the thing, destroy it. But it\u2019s too fine a trophy to throw away. I have nothing else. My entire life is gone but for this small thing. I stare at it. I can always go to a news-pile, someone who might be interested, but it would be crushed before it could flourish. No way to prove it came from above. Just a trail of bodies. The tinboots would just shut it all down, probably kill anyone I told.\nI stop, light cracking me clear in the head. Inspiration. I shove the tech back in my pocket and get crawling, a destination now bright in my mind. It takes time, because no one really moves through the maintenance ways, because no one should have to. But I pick my way closer and closer until I\u2019m sliding out of a vent and into an empty thin-way. I stroll out into the main corridor as if I\u2019m picking up milk for Mum. Only she\u2019s dead, and Hol\u2019s dead, and all my friends are dead. We were nothing, just stains to be washed away, but I\u2019ll make them pay for it.\nI drop the tech into a small bin and keep on walking. I make it to the other side of the street and tuck my hands in my pockets and I wait. The street is swarming with tinboots. And of course, as their main station for Big Dive is right in front of me. The bin is a drop for information. A careful cop would take the tech out of it and scan it in an isolated system, make sure it was clean. But I\u2019ve heard enough tinboots grumble to know that they don\u2019t have the time or tech for that.\nThey\u2019ll grab it and scan it, thinking it\u2019s just some sort of local dirt, maybe a tip about a skim, but instead they\u2019ll see their screen go funny like I saw at Dana\u2019s. And then all the screens in the station will go funny. There\u2019s a shout from inside the station and tinboots are starting to run.\nLet them eat that. Let them get a taste of nothing. Court dates and prisoner transfers, warrants and who knows what else. Pay orders, definitely, and benefits. Tinboot vacation days. Everything fragged. Months. I smile. They\u2019ll be frothing, biting mad, and as much as the powers that be will try to convince them that this was a terrorist thing or a lowly thing, someone will find out where the tech came from. And maybe then the tinboots will be angry enough to bite the hand that feeds them their scraps.\nThe station is roiling, and a tinboot walking by stops at seeing me.\n\u201cWhat you smiling at?\u201d he asks, a threat, and in a moment I\u2019ll walk off and disappear. But for now my smile lingers.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I say.\nCharles Payseur currently resides in the icy reaches of Wisconsin, where his partner, good cheese, and craft beer get him through the long winters.

Though more than willing to exchange pleasantries, most are unwilling to speak above a whisper in my presence, let alone sing or perform. But they are fascinating, vibrant, eternally youthful, and more than content to live far outside the realm of civilization. I suspect there are secrets hiding beneath the idyllic exterior of this village.\nI fear that my time here will be wasted and that their songs, the effects of which are now lauded throughout Hot Springs and the surrounding villages, will never grace my ears and, worse still, that this unique cultural landscape may, in fact, be forgotten.\nMy generous donors have provided me with enough funds to stay afloat in this venture for a minimum of five years. By the date of my impending departure, I hope that I will have more to show from these individuals than sketches of closed doors.\n\u2014Journal of Oliver Pound, Hot Springs, North Carolina, May 1916\n* * *\nYears Ago\nAugust 1916\nTwo Weeks After the Flood\nOur passionate composer, Ms. Eustacia Greene, was having one of her fits on the soapbox, flailing her arms in the air like the Coopers\u2019 boy who didn\u2019t know better and gesticulating wildly to anyone who dared look up into her fiery eyes and tawny fingers waving at our weary faces. \u201cAin\u2019t nonna you gonna talk to him,\u201d she repeated again. She pointed to an oddly dressed man in the back of the makeshift hall. The fat of her underarm jiggled and the old box bowed and rattled beneath her heavy frame. \u201cYou can\u2019t! It\u2019ll be the end of us. Sharing our songs with this . . . this man.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019ll flood this whole damn town again.\u201d\nStunned villagers seated on hay bales, gathered for the impromptu debate in the whitewashed Clemson barn, gasped, embarrassed by Stacia\u2019s outlandish display in front of the outsider who had recently arrived with his pens and papers. Others swooned and shifted awkwardly atop the makeshift straw benches. An offended, superstitious few attendees even fanned away the air Stacia had fouled with talk of floods and damnation, cautiously subverting the demons she undoubtedly unleashed in her trivialization of the greatest tragedy that had heretofore befallen our little town.\nBut the comments did nothing to phase the implacable stranger, Mr. Oliver Pound, the Paperman, as some called him. Not even the sticky August heat flustered him or curled the edges of his heavy tweed jacket, knee-highs, and soft demeanor. It was possible he didn\u2019t hear her, but the taut lines around his mouth showed signs of slight disapproval.\nDrusie the Conductor rose and sauntered to the soapbox with her baton and cane in tow. Throughout the pit, backs straightened on instinct when she tapped her black wand on her wrist, and all were quiet. \u201cNow that\u2019s enough, Stacia,\u201d she said, ushering the quivering woman back to her seat, surprising us with her brevity. \u201cYou can see, Misser Pound, some of us here aren\u2019t quite ready for that which you have so kindly offered.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Drusie, with all respect that is due, of course,\u201d said Eule Clarke the Baritone after clearing his throat, \u201cI\u2019m none too sure all of us have had an opportunity to hear this kind man\u2019s offer.\u201d He nodded to the Paperman, who smiled in response.\n\u201cWell, as I\u2019ve told some of you already, the offer is quite simple, really,\u201d Pound said, rising and brushing the hay from his pant seat. He was stifling a sneeze as he addressed the crowd with conviction in his voice. I had yet to hear him speak, and it struck me then how much his words didn\u2019t sound like ours. They were a song unto themselves, strange, musical lilts, pure and flowing like a babbling brook. \u201cBut if you\u2019ll indulge me. Before explaining my offer, I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to all of you who have kindly allowed me into your homes to share in your company and good graces.\u201d\nThe Paperman grinned all cheeky at Ms. Willadeen the Soprano and the recently widowed Old Feraby the Clogger. Young Feraby\u2019s porcelain face went flush with rage as Pound exchanged untoward glances with her mother, scandalized. \u201cNow, I\u2019d like for you to understand that I will not, I stress, I will not be recording anything of yours that you do not wish to be shared. I\u2019ve come to your village as a surveyor, a historian, a documentarian. And, yes, I\u2019ve heard the names some of you call me. And I assure you, the rumors are unfounded. I am not a thief, and I have no interest in profiting on your musical endeavors.\u201d\nEule harrumphed from the depths of his cavernous diaphragm, and the beams of the barn shook with his breath. In the dank corner where I had taken to hiding to watch the spectacle unfold, dirt fell from a rafter and landed on my head, inciting me to sneeze.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can convince you otherwise,\u201d Pound said. \u201cI\u2019ve come all this way, hiking through those treacherous valleys. And then, then I swam across the Broad River just to meet you and hear your songs. All for you. Certainly, you must have them. Songs you can perform. The people of Hot Springs were all too willing to share their histories. I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Pound searched the room for support and found none. \u201cIt\u2019s for posterity, you see. For your children\u2019s children. A village unique as this one must be known to the world.\u201d\nPound reached for his satchel and grabbed a stack of leaflets. \u201cI\u2019ll pay well. I\u2019ve the money to do so.\u201d\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t magic, you do know that, don\u2019t you, Mr. Pound?\u201d Eule said, speaking on behalf of the rest of us.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand,\u201d Pound replied.\n\u201cHot Springs, that town. It\u2019s been there for what, eighty years now? How long you reckon we\u2019ve been here, Mr. Pound?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cLonger than that,\u201d Eule said. \u201cYou think they have our history?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose not. No.\u201d\n\u201cSo what makes you think it\u2019s a good idea to compare us like you done?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m. . . .\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you think keeps those springs, oh I don\u2019t know, hot, Mr. Pound?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a geologist, Mr. Clarke.\u201d\n\u201cNot just geology that does it, Mr. Pound,\u201d Eule said, looking up from the piece of straw he had been knotting. \u201cThey just songs to you folk. Little ditties for play by the porchlight with your shine and all. If we open our songbook to the likes of you, the whole damn world\u2019ll know it soon enough. All types of folk\u2019ll sing them. Sure. But they won\u2019t understand them. Won\u2019t care to. And what about us? What you leaving behind? Just an angry river and a people without a voice to fight with. You don\u2019t understand us, Mr. Pound. Never will.\u201d\nMiles away, a dog barked. Eule picked at his fingers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Eule,\u201d Drusie said, bucking convention by not using his surname in public. A single mosquito buzzed between the rafters. \u201cMr. Pound, we\u2019re clearly unprepared for your offer. And we think it is best that you return to Hot Springs. At least until we\u2019ve had time to consider.\u201d\nPound collected his scant belongings from the dirt floor. \u201cI\u2019ll return in two weeks. Should you need me, I will be at the Mountain Park Hotel.\u201d He left, and the building erupted with argument.\nYoung Feraby rushed toward me, no doubt hoping to speak ill of the stranger whose eyes had looked too fondly at her mother, but I dodged her advance and took shelter in the crowd. I was small for seventeen, but my size allowed me to sneak through the sea of shoulders that stood between me and my true escape, lost again in the quiet anonymity that accompanied my lonely youth.\nStacia howled, \u201cPositions. Positions for the nightsong,\u201d but no one heard until Drusie stepped to the podium and tapped her baton, in one gesture silencing the cacophony that had overcome the chorus.\nWith her worn leather composition book in hand, Stacia took her position in front of the band and faced Drusie. Calmly, she said, \u201cTonight, we sing the Song of the Bewildered Black Bear. Let\u2019s put those menacing giants to ease.\u201d\nAs the backs of my kin straightened and steel strings tautened on ivory pegs, I escaped unnoticed and ran to watch the curious Paperman leave our village grounds. Behind me, I could hear Stacia begin her solo.\nDaylight was leaving our mountain to shed its good graces elsewhere beyond the trees. Crickets chirped, and lightning bugs made fleeting constellations in the dusk sky. The lush greens of the trees and scattered summer foliage produced a sweet smell that perfumed the air with freshness, and the old homes surrounding the clearing with their rusty tin roofs were quiet in anticipation of the ritual performance of the evening melody. Beneath the potent and soothing odors of the late summer leaves, a rotting smell, remnant of the flood, lingered in the wood that sheltered us, repressed like bad memories brought to surface by scratching too hard in the wrong place.\nA cool northerly wind brushed my face.\n\u201cI see you hiding there.\u201d Pound turned to face the log pile I thought had concealed me.\n\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo matter. You know, your people are certainly stubborn with their music.\u201d\n\u201cNot all of us, no.\u201d\nHe hoisted his bag onto his back. \u201cNevertheless, this doesn\u2019t seem like a matter you can resolve. Where are your parents, young man?\u201d\n\u201cPa\u2019s on the coast makin\u2019 weapons to fight the Huns. Ma\u2019s not around no more.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why is that?\u201d\n\u201cShe died. Starved.\u201d\n\u201cNow your father takes care of you.\u201d He brushed dirt from his jacket and exhaled. \u201cEveryone is bracing for this damnable war. It\u2019s all too disturbing for my taste, the violence. I prefer music. My piano teacher used to tell me that fingers like mine were never meant for anything less than ivory.\u201d Those fingers wiped sweat from his tanned brow. \u201cDo forgive my manners. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cMessy,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAnd when will your father return?\u201d\n\u201cGot a letter that said he may be home as soon as this weekend.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Messy, when your father returns, please tell him of my project. In the meantime, maybe you should consider speaking up in there, stepping out from behind the logs, as it were. A boy like you must have a lot of thoughts worth hearing.\u201d\nI scratched my head.\n\u201cThe land here really is remarkable,\u201d Pound said. \u201cMaybe you can tell me one thing, though. What did Mr. Clarke mean when he spoke about keeping the Hot Springs hot?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Pound,\u201d I said.\n* * *\nI had baritone tutoring the evening after the Paperman left town. We had just finished singing the lumber song. It was the last song Jinetty taught me. The story goes that she wrote it while she was carving a piece of birch as a birthday gift for Stacia. On handing it to her sister, Jinetty started singing, and the wood sprang right back to life, budding greens in Stacia\u2019s trembling hands.\nJinetty was like that. She always found joy in her music and could command a melody to force audiences to understand her. The incident at Hot Springs wasn\u2019t her first transgression, but no one knew that but me. For years before she died, Jinetty had been skipping town and singing our songs throughout the county to those who needed their healing powers.\n\u201cShe was a traitor. You know that, aye, Messy?\u201d Eule said during our lesson that evening.\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\n\u201cNow, you don\u2019t sound none too certain. I hear your voice breaking.\u201d Eule was the kindest of the elders, but his temper was as notorious as the volume of his voice. \u201cShe was your teacher,\u201d he continued and stilled the rattling glass with an abrupt decrescendo. \u201cSo I know this can\u2019t be easy on you to admit, but you have to acknowledge why what she did was wrong. Nobody, none of us, can share our song with outsiders, River Song especially. You understand?\u201d\n\u201cShe was dying in the Springs, Mr. Eule. She was scared, alone and dying, and she didn\u2019t know no better. Even that man at the hotel said she had her shoes on.\u201d Ms. Jinetty never hummed with shoes on. She said it broke the link.\n\u201cI know the story,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even if she was sick. Even if she helped that man who came to the Springs for healing, she still shared the River Song.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is. So what? She shared a song with someone willing? So what he\u2019s an outsider? Why is that so bad? She deserved better than that ghost burial the bass section gave her, anyhow. No one cried. No one sang.\u201d\n\u201cBut you,\u201d he said into his drink. \u201cNow, I know you think no one sees you. But you dead wrong.\u201d He set down his hot beverage and dug at a hangnail. \u201cJinetty was special to all of us. But custom is custom,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t change that. No one needs to know you made those flowers bloom around her headstone. And I ain\u2019t in a hurry to tell. No real harm done.\n\u201cLook. There\u2019s power in our songs. Salvation. Each time we sing \u2019em they lose strength. Weaker yet until a new composer, a channel, come along and hears a new song from the river, the trees, the animals, what have you. The forces around us, the river especially, they\u2019re jealous lovers. They want a bond. They need to feel connections just like we do. So they link up with the lucky few composers who share their message with us.\n\u201cYes. You, too. Even your momma\u2019s blood couldn\u2019t take the river out you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut what if we\u2019re wrong?\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t. I asked that same thing once. Then I shared the sun song with someone I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d He lifted up the side of his shirt. Leathery scar tissue covered his stomach. \u201cI paid for it. So, see, it\u2019s our pact with them, the woods, the river, the skies, the whole lot of it, it\u2019s our pact that keeps things constant. And if\u2019n we break that pact, the river will roar, the woods will burn, and the skies will crumble.\u201d\nHe jabbed a bony finger at my forehead. \u201cThink about all the songs we have, Gale Winds Go, Quiet Mosquito, Bewildered Bear, Lumbering Tree, Rain Make Right, River Song, Stay Sun, all of them. Think what would happen if all those songs leave our village. Flood was a warning shot. We wronged the river by sharing her song, and she wanted her revenge.\n\u201cWe getting old, and times is hard. Have to do whatever it takes to preserve our community. That means no sharing. With anyone.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s gotta be room for outsiders, Mr. Eule. Can\u2019t be that we shrivel up and die like nothin\u2019. Others agree.\u201d\n\u201cBut others try to make a martyr out of old Jin. You know what a martyr is?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s someone who exposes us because she want attention. Now, look here,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou a special boy. I know it. With your mam passing and your pap not being \u2019round on account of his working as hard as he does. . . . Well, hell, maybe you didn\u2019t get the fairest shake at things, but your ear is on. And I know Jin, she looked out for you, but the rest of us\u2019ll do the same. Now you go on.\u201d\nI got up to leave, but Eule gripped my shoulder like a vise. \u201cOne more thing. The tune you sang at her grave. Well, she\u2019da been proud for what you done. Ain\u2019t easy making flowers bloom by yourself. You did it without breaking a sweat.\u201d\nCouncil convened in private the next morning. At the midday gathering, Stacia announced that Mr. Pound would leave our village without hearing our songs. The matter had been settled, beyond my influence.\n* * *\nOne evening toward week\u2019s end, Pap returned from the coast a tightly wound mass of greased industrial muscle with lint-lined pockets, cashed government checks, and a termination letter in tow. His arms tore through his old shirt sleeves, tanned and cut like jerky. And the overalls that cost him three month\u2019s savings were black with oil from machines he said were taller than buildings.\nOur small log home wasn\u2019t more than a cracked foundation, two busted doors, and a roof that leaked when the rain got too heavy, which hadn\u2019t happened lately, not since the flood. So the city Pap spoke of was a fantasy by comparison. Our place had three beds for Pap, Mam, and me. After Mam died, it was just me and Pap. He let me push my bed and hers together to form one big bed. I slept like a king there.\nPap and I sat on our small porch sipping water from glass jars Jinetty gave me. \u201cHeard there was some hullabill at the Clemsons\u2019 last,\u201d Pap said. \u201cYou taken to going to these town meetings in your ma and my stead, right? So what you thinka that?\u201d Pap spat his tobacco into a flask he kept in his front overall pocket. His breath smelled of sweet grapes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t say as I do either. Glad I ain\u2019t callin\u2019 the shots for the rest of you.\u201d\nOur stomachs rumbled. Pap got up and walked to the small room where we kept our canned foods. \u201cI been travelin\u2019 all over the Carolinas of late,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople gone crazy \u2019bout the war. Scared that the man in charge gonna send good folks away to Europe. Can you imagine? Europe.\u201d He sighed. He returned to me with an open jar of turnips. With ease in his giant hands, he twisted the lid open with a rewarding pop.\n\u201cLot different now than when your ma and I came up. Lot different.\u201d He took a seat beside me again and surveyed the village. \u201cBut not much changed here. People here. They don\u2019t change. That\u2019s a good thing, Mess. Real good.\u201d\n\u201cPap, I want to go see the coast with you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cTrust me. You don\u2019t. And I\u2019ll keep you away from there long as I can. It ain\u2019t good for you. Not good for anyone,\u201d he said before he smiled at me. \u201cThis is home. Good people. Good music. It\u2019s our job to protect it. We need to stick together. Too many places falling apart nowadays.\u201d\nI opened my mouth to speak, but he nudged me with his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s our job. And it\u2019s my job to protect you. So here\u2019s the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou worry \u2019bout the Springs. I\u2019ll worry \u2019bout you.\u201d His smile calmed the anxious stirring in my stomach. \u201cKnow somethin\u2019? I walked through too many towns like ours on the way back. Too many. Most are fallin\u2019 apart. Just like ours. People don\u2019t want no pottery or no patterned quilts like the ones we try to sell in town. Heck, don\u2019t even want instruments no more. Gots them radios for entertainment. Recording discs. Moving pictures. Hmph. . . . Different world out there, Mess. Too different.\u201d\nI wriggled impatiently beside him.\n\u201cGuess your old man is boring you, huh? Remember, you let me worry about you. Well.\u201d He looked down the road. \u201cLooks like they are getting ready for the nightsong down there.\u201d He pointed to the barn. \u201cGo on. I want to hear you sing. Mr. Eule tells me you learning well. May be as good as your old man someday.\u201d He chuckled.\nI left him and meandered to the spot where the rest of the choir had gathered for the evening congregation. Stacia had taken her seat as we prepared to sing the nightsong. I took my place in the back between taller boys who sang lower and louder than me. The tune was older than anyone present, older even than the painted rock. Words had changed over time as the revelations adapted to our changing tongue, but the ancient melodies persisted, strong as the deepest roots.\nA haze washed over the expressionless performers.\nJinetty told me not to think during the nightsong, that it\u2019s best just to tune it all out and focus on our breathing, like meditation or something. Our instruments kept perfect tempo as banjos flailed and countless strings picked alternating rhythms through the simple verses and chorus lines.\nWe filled the song break with clogging, clapping, and laughter. Vocal harmonies permeated the tune and gave it a natural completeness like all of the elements were working to create something beautiful.\nI took my time getting home. When I arrived, a candle was burning in the window. Pap\u2019s hunched silhouette was a falling boulder, hanging tenuously above the tiny wood plank pushed up under the glass. The door creaked when I opened it, and Pap\u2019s eyes darted up at me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cSounded good tonight,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong, Pap.\u201d\n\u201cWe just hurting for money is all. But don\u2019t you worry.\u201d A crumpled stack of pay stubs lined the table in front of him. \u201cWe got enough food for a week or so. I can cash what\u2019s left in my account. Maybe that\u2019ll buy us another. We\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about it. You rehearse. You get better. You work on keeping the elders in order. Like I said, I worry about you. I protect you. And I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep food on your table. I promise you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I\u2019ll work.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You\u2019re still my boy. You follow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. . . .\u201d\n\u201cLet me be sure for you.\u201d\n* * *\nA week later, I awoke hungry to the piercing sounds of a loon on water. Falsetto laughter filled my ears and made images in my half-sleep of the singer\u2019s lush, spotted plumage and ebony-carved head. The loon song drove me to the river, where the elders, Eule, Drusie, and Stacia, had gathered at the foot of the water.\n\u201cYou heard it, too?\u201d Eule said from a distance. They were all fully clothed, and I was suddenly embarrassed by my pajama bottoms and bare feet.\n\u201cYah, woke me up.\u201d The elders exchanged knowing looks like I had missed their punch line.\n\u201cPoor bird been crying for an hour now. Something ticked it off,\u201d Eule said to no one in particular.\n\u201cWhat do you hear now, son?\u201d Stacia said.\n\u201cAnd listen real close. Harder than you\u2019ve listened before,\u201d Drusie added.\nQuietly, I stood at their sides as the warmth of the rushing river submerged my feet. Brush and driftwood floated past me, stopped on gnarly roots that hung over the water, impatient to return to the current that drove downstream. A faint whistling skimmed across the surface as the brush tried to escape its tangles, and the flow became rhythmic.\nAnother loon joined the morning caller that drew us there. Together, the birds made melodic harmonies that colored the symphony unfolding in front of me.\nWater passed through my splayed fingers, and the tension in my stomach melted with its touch. The sensation was electric, and my hairs stood on end and ached. Then the song came from me, though I had never heard it before. Words like flotsam trailed by and tickled my tongue, and I became them.\nAnd in a breath, it was over.\nEule tells me that my body collapsed right after I stopped singing. I don\u2019t remember any of it. But he swears he dove in to rescue me.\nThe lot of them were surrounding me when I came to.\n\u201cLooks like we have a channel on our hands,\u201d Stacia said. \u201cYou\u2019re a composer, Mess.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like,\u201d Eule replied.\n\u201cAnd we have a new River Song. It\u2019s something.\u201d Drusie smiled.\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d I asked, looking up at the three elders, overwhelmed. My tiny heart raced faster than Maylilly could flat-pick a tune. My stomach growled a low B.\n\u201cNow, you listen,\u201d Stacia said.\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\n\u201cThen you listen more.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\u201cThen you write what you hear.\u201d\n\u201cThat it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, boy. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take time. But nature likes to let things run her course. We just observers, you understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d I nodded. \u201cRight you do. In a few years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll get the choir singing your songs. And soon after, when I\u2019m cold and in the ground, you\u2019ll be the new composer. Time for you to step out of the dark. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\nI stood speechless.\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said.\n* * *\nSeptember 1916\nThe Drought\nA foggy heat had settled over our village and muddled the angry voices that spoke to me from the thin clouds and dying trees. It hadn\u2019t rained for six weeks, and our crops were dying. Still, strong gusts of wind blew through town intermittently to provide temporary solace from the dry heat.\nI had taken to attending daily meetings with the elders. Their company was more enjoyable than I had expected. They carried on with their business in spite of my frequent questioning. I watched as they acted with staggering efficiency, picking the next generation of performers, tending to instrument repairs, and ensuring that the few knickknacks our little hovel produced would be adequate enough to barter for next week\u2019s meat supply.\nTwo weeks into my training, I sat in my first emergency meeting to address our dwindling supplies. \u201cSomething ain\u2019t right,\u201d Drusie said through a bite of hot turnips.\n\u201cHow long since the last rain?\u201d Eule asked.\nStacia scratched at her neck. \u201cAt least eight weeks. Right before that Paperman arrived. Around Jinetty. . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s killing my flowers. Went for a walk yesterday and saw that all the azaleas are drying up, wilting in the heat,\u201d Eule added.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me started,\u201d Stacia said. \u201cNot seen a summer this hot since, heck, I don\u2019t know when. Mosquitoes are having a ball with it. I\u2019m starting to worry about the children getting sick.\u201d\n\u201cSomething\u2019s definitely wrong.\u201d\n\u201cJust too hot,\u201d Eule said.\n\u201cSure is,\u201d Stacia said, gnawing at her lip now. \u201cI can\u2019t say I like it, but it may be time for a change. My time may be short yet. Singing Rain Make Right ain\u2019t working like it used to. You up for that, Mess?\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt might be your time to lead,\u201d Stacia said.\n\u201cNo, no. I ain\u2019t ready, Ms. Stacia. You can\u2019t go. We still need you.\u201d My voice croaked.\n\u201cAw, Mess. You can see it. My songs aren\u2019t working any more. High time for a new composer.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Give it time. Weather\u2019ll turn. Fall is coming. We can wait a bit, can\u2019t we?\u201d I pleaded. \u201cIn the meanwhile, we can keep on with my lessons. Make sure that I\u2019m the right one for the job if\u2019n it comes to that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn one, boy. But, we give you a week,\u201d Drusie said.\nThe smell of grilled meat filled my nose when I burst over the threshold to our open home. Pap had set two places at the kitchen table. On rusty steel platters were two slabs of thick red steak, each the size of my fist.\n\u201cGot you something,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPap, we can\u2019t afford\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat did I tell you? You let me worry about you. I know what we can and can\u2019t afford. Now sit and tell me why you\u2019re in such a hurry.\u201d\nPride filled my Pa\u2019s face and warmed his stubbled cheeks as he looked at me. \u201cThey want you to be the lead channel, the composer? Who would\u2019ve thought? And they always saying you wouldn\u2019t amount to nothing.\u201d He laughed and slapped my back.\nWhen we had finished eating, he poured us two glasses of lemon drink, foggy like river water. We sat on the porch bathed in the orange light of dusk.\nA mosquito buzzed past Pap\u2019s head. He swatted at it, but it was relentless in its meandering pursuit. Another joined it. And then another. Before we could react, a swarm of mosquitos encircled Pap like a halo. The cacophonous buzzing was so loud that it attracted a group of watchers from the farm, who ran to our porch to suss out the commotion.\n\u201cNow, what in the hell?\u201d Pap said, swatting at the mosquitos. The carrion swarm sang notes deep and corrupt, made sour with rage. Acting on instinct, I began humming \u201cQuiet Mosquito\u201d to calm their feuding hearts. The song broke through my nervous lips, a force of nature drawn from my mouth like water from cracks in broken dams. The swarm halted, and for a moment they hovered around my cowering father, contemplating. Then they flew away.\nAbove the crowd that stood motionless with jaws agape, sheets of gray and black draped the sun like curtains falling, and a barrage of timpani echoed on the horizon to mark the breaking of the drought. Their repetitive tritones crescendoed in warning. A storm was coming.\n\u201cHe broke our trust.\u201d Eule\u2019s voice was a solitary horn piercing through the resting throng below our steps. \u201cHe sold the songs. There\u2019s no other explanation. You all know it. He sold our songs to Pound and now nature is coming for all of us to atone for what he done.\u201d\nPap\u2019s eyes had swollen shut from the attack, and his scaled tongue fell from his mouth like a limp snake.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do nothing like that, Mr. Eule,\u201d I said, raising my voice to match his timbre. \u201cHe loves this town. He told me to protect it. To protect all you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat proof you got, Mess? Seems to me these here happenings speak for themselves. So prove it, boy. Prove your pappy didn\u2019t sell our songs. Then he can stay.\u201d\nI ran to town to the one person who would know the truth.\n* * *\nOliver Pound had rented two rooms in the Mountain Park Hotel, the multilevel structure that a rich man bought some years ago to capitalize off the healing powers of the springs.\nIt was a delicate building, whitewashed with rust-red spires and matching canopies. The grass around it was freshly shorn and smelled of summer after the rain. The hotel was almost empty. Of the two dozen windows facing the lawn, only five were lit.\nRumors of the palatial structure\u2019s demise had been spreading throughout our town and neighboring villages. Not many people were wanting a vacation with war on the horizon. Latest news was that the federal government was fixing to buy the place and turn it into some sort of camp. Pound was among the last willing inhabitants of the hotel.\nI ran the four miles from my home to the hotel and stopped once to catch my breath. When I found his stable at the hotel, the charcoal sky smoked above me, pierced by yellow threads, random brushstrokes of light on a chiaroscuro sky. The stable reeked of old manure and wet grass. Sitting in the center of the hay-covered floor, a box of large, black metallic discs glistened with the lightning strikes. I shrugged away nagging doubts that this box could be proof of his transgression as I picked up a disc and felt its weight in my hand. It was smooth but for small grooves like cart tracks that circled the whole of it in perfect rows, never touching.\n\u201cReally something, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nI jumped and saw the Paperman standing behind me, dressed in night garments.\n\u201cMessy, yes?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cMr. Pound . . . I. . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only natural you would be curious. I\u2019m sure your father told you about our project.\u201d\nI prayed for shelter in the ill-lit room. \u201cYour project?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the songs. He was coming here to record them. Your father has a beautiful voice. Would you like to hear one?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is remarkable.\u201d He walked to the corner of the room, where a green cloth covered a large box that had been placed atop two stools. He removed the sheet and revealed an alien contraption.\nThere was a wheel, like one we use to spin clay, and a gilded hand crank sticking out beside it. Attached to both of these objects through a series of strange wires was an elevated, steely flower blossom.\nPound could see me admiring the contraption. It provided a momentary distraction from the pain I felt at my father\u2019s betrayal. \u201cIt\u2019s called a phonograph.\u201d He approached me and delicately pried the heavy disc from my hands. \u201cIt takes what\u2019s on these recording discs and projects them through the speaker as sound. Look.\u201d\nHe placed the disc atop the spinner and began to crank the small handle beside it. The disc caught the light of his lantern and flashed in my eye.\n\u201cWait, Mr. Pound,\u201d I said suddenly.\n\u201cSomething the matter?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time.\u201d\n\u201cBut you wait. Let me ask you. Your father told me you know the River Song. Like the one that kind woman sang the gentleman in town before she passed.\u201d\n\u201cYou know about Ms. Jinetty?\u201d\n\u201cThe man she saved, Frederick McHenry, he told me about what she did. She saved him. A true miracle worker.\u201d\nHeavy drops of rain began falling, a rhythmic tapping on the tin roof, each drop a reminder.\nI couldn\u2019t focus on the Paperman. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he hid it from me. He betrayed our people.\u201d\n\u201cI refuse to believe things are so clear cut, Messy. He didn\u2019t want you to starve, you see. And I was in the market for songs. And, the more he shared, the more I wanted. My damnable thirst for understanding, if you will.\u201d He put his free hand across his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever in my power to help make this right if you\u2019ll only show me more. If you\u2019ll show me the River Song, perhaps? It\u2019s the one thing he wouldn\u2019t share.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nWith unflinching commitment, he followed me outside, where heavy drops pierced through our clothing.\nPound ran to keep pace with me, and together we traversed the woods with only brief appearances of moonlight through the tumultuous skies to guide us.\nBy the time we arrived back at town, our gentle summer storm had erupted into a tempest, thrashing dry branches about their host trees like whip cracks. Pound was brimming with excitement.\nThe swollen ground, unaccustomed to the rain and saturated with the nascent torrents, gave way as our footsteps left deep prints in the soaked brush.\nTown was empty.\n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Pound said.\n\u201cI lied to you about the River Song, Mr. Pound.\u201d\n\u201cYou what?\u201d\n\u201cI lied. My pap is in danger. Real danger. And it\u2019s because he sold our songs to you.\u201d My voice was weak, and it quivered when I looked up into his startled eyes. Panicked, I looked around for signs of where they took him. \u201cI came to you for help. I came \u2019cause I thought you would redeem him. I was wrong. But I get it now.\u201d\nI could see him searching for meaning in my face. \u201cYou need to be here. You need to witness before our people that you\u2019re not going to harm us. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here. I\u2019m the channel now. Me. Not them. They have to trust me. And you need to show them you can be trusted.\u201d\n\u201cShow who?\u201d\n\u201cThe voice\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMessy!\u201d Young Feraby yelled to me. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken your father to the river.\u201d\n\u201cThe river? Why?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThey want him to atone to for selling his songs to Mr. Pound. When you left, he told us he done it. They gonna throw him in and let the river sort it out.\u201d Her tiny chest heaved.\n\u201cBut he can\u2019t swim in his state,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to the river.\u201d\n\u201cShow who?\u201d Pound said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Just keep up, Mr. Pound.\u201d\n* * *\nWe heard them before we saw them\u2014Pap\u2019s muffled protests cracking through the parting in his swollen lips, and Eule yelling orders to the bass section to keep Pap in the river. Pound and I ran to the grove. My feet ached and my wet clothes dragged behind me.\n\u201cWhat are they going to do to him?\u201d Pound said through the commotion.\n\u201cThey mean to give him to the river to atone.\u201d\n\u201cWhy on earth\u2014?\u201d He returned his focus to running and caught his breath. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d Pound followed me as I hid behind an evergreen bush blooming pink with mountain laurels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of seeking forgiveness.\u201d\nPound blushed. \u201cHe told me he had permission.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHe said he needed the money. . . . To help feed you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that much is true.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now they are going to kill him?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not murderers. They just don\u2019t understand nature\u2019s wish. But I think I do. I just need to show them.\u201d\nThrough the thick blanket of rain, I could hardly make out the men of the bass section from our vantage. They supported Pap\u2019s slumped frame in the water. Behind them were Stacia, Drusie, and Eule. While Eule commanded, Drusie held tight to her walking stick, and Stacia paced the banks and bit at her nails.\nBetween thunderclaps, Stacia called order, and all eyes went to her as she waded into the river and stood beside Pap. \u201cWe can\u2019t survive another flood. First Jinny and now you.\u201d She wagged a long finger at Pap. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough betrayal for a lifetime. What you have to say for yourself?\u201d\nPap\u2019s motionless body roused to life. His wet hair clung to his face and beard. \u201cI did what I had to. I did what I could to protect my boy.\u201d\nPound turned too late to talk to me. I was already halfway to Pap.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Mess?\u201d Eule said.\n\u201cYou have to stop this. Stop it now!\u201d\n\u201cMess?\u201d Pap said. \u201cMess, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at him like this. So I focused on Eule. \u201cMr. Eule, Ms. Stacia, Ms. Drusie, you have to understand that what he did and what Ms. Jinetty did weren\u2019t wrong. Couldn\u2019ta been.\u201d\n\u201cHow we feel don\u2019t matter none,\u201d Eule said, water dripping from his pallid face.\n\u201cMr. Eule, please. Let me sing to the river. Let me sing its song. I\u2019ll make the river understand.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d Drusie said. \u201cNot in the presence of that interloper there.\u201d She pointed her walking stick in Pound\u2019s direction. Sheepish, the Paperman walked out from behind the evergreen.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo. Mr. Pound, you stay,\u201d I said.\nFamiliar gusts of wind rushed through the river valley and made branches snap from their trees and tear across the water. But the bass section held fast on Pap and shielded their faces with their free hands.\n\u201cMr. Pound,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy did you really come to the springs?\u201d\n\u201cI came to learn about your history. To preserve your songs.\u201d\n\u201cDid you come to sell them?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s what my benefactor wanted. But I never\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMr. Pound, tell them what you told me in the barn.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to understand the power of your songs. That\u2019s all I wanted. And when Messy\u2019s father offered to share your world with me, I couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve wanted since I\u2019ve come here. I want to learn.\u201d\n\u201cYou see?\u201d I said to Eule.\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\u201cHow can sharing our songs with someone who truly wants to understand them be so bad?\u201d\n\u201cFine, Mess,\u201d Eule said, the last of the color draining from his cheeks. \u201cFine. Damn it. But, don\u2019t you see? What I think don\u2019t matter none. Look at the water. Look at the skies. Someone has to pay for what your father did when he showed this man our songs.\u201d\nLightning struck, and a branch the size of a boat dropped to the ground behind us.\n\u201cThen let him go. Let the river decide.\u201d\n\u201cMess\u2014\u201d Pap said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pap. Let me worry about you.\u201d\nThe bass section released Pap, and Pap flailed in the clutches of the cold water beneath him.\nI listened, tuning out the storm and commotion around me like Jinetty taught me. Rippling water swelled around my feet, expanding and collapsing on the banks, and thunder cracked above us.\n\u201cThat man is drowning,\u201d Pound said. \u201cYou must do something.\u201d He tried to run for Pap, but the basses stood in front of him with their folded arms, denying him passage. I listened real close to all the sounds around me, the sighing of the trees, the rushing of the water, and the fearful cries of the birds in flight above me. Again, I closed my mind to outside thoughts. The notes came before I realized I was singing them, and from them sprang a song unlike any I\u2019d ever heard.\nAs I sang, the river swirled around me and Pap. He had stopped his resistance and given himself to the tides that fought to carry him away.\nLike dozens of hands buttressing, gusts of wind shot through the valley and turned to a powerful gale force, pushing against Pap and holding him upright against the current, defiant. Then, from the heavy breath of the wind stream, Jinetty\u2019s wispy voice made itself known to the furor below and beckoned to our lost ancestors to join us.\nEveryone watched with their quiet mouths as Pap\u2019s body tore from the river\u2019s clutches and floated in the air above.\nBecause of Jinetty\u2019s plea, a chorus of thousand voices joined me. The wind, rain, dirt, and trees each lent their voices in the conflict with the rapids. The angry river began to glow, iridescent like a jar of fireflies, resisting our pleas. Blue spheres rushed to the surface and engulfed us with their heat, but I remained still despite my searing flesh.\n\u201cWhere are the voices coming from?\u201d the Paperman yelled.\nThe water bit my body like beestings and I began to lose the song. Pap\u2019s body sank lower, closer to the heaving river that reached to claim him.\nBut the tide shifted again; Jinetty\u2019s melody coaxed the river and forced it to complement her notes in duet, demanding it to understand. In turn, the rushing torrents went placid and brush skittered across the river\u2019s glassy surface. Then Jinetty\u2019s solo, serene, weathered, and ancient, proud and forceful, burst forth from the skies around us.\nFor that moment, there was no other sound in the world but her.\nBlack tears rolled down Stacia\u2019s craggy face, lost in the folds of her weathered skin. \u201cShe\u2019s here. . . .\u201d\nWhen I could no longer sing, she would always take my burden. Hearing her then, and seeing Pap\u2019s unconscious body float to safety on the banks, I burst into tears. My mouth was hot, and singing pained me to no end. But, with gravel in my throat, I joined her for a final song. As we sang, the voices of my ancestors joined us for the final movement.\nAnd then they vanished completely.\nPap gasped for air on the bank, and Pound rushed to his side to aid him.\n\u201cJinetty. . . .\u201d Stacia said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s found a new home in the river.\u201d\n* * *\nOctober 1916\nAfter\nThe Paperman returned one week after that night in the grove. He promised he would get rid of the records somehow. And then he asked if he could stay with us and learn our ways. I didn\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t. At that point, Eule and the elders didn\u2019t, either. We put it to a vote and it was unanimous. Eule even volunteered to teach him a thing or two.\nThe evening after the vote, the air was cool and the mosquitoes had all but vanished back into the woods that walled our village. Nature had found her harmony again.\nThe Clemson barn looked different under the pale moon. The storm had ruined the paint and revealed the sheenless wood beneath the lacquered beams.\nEveryone had taken their places in the barn with eager eyes, watching as Stacia ushered me forward. I took my place in front of the choir. Pound stared at me, anxious for his first nightsong. Pap watched me as Drusie tapped her baton, and I sang my solo in the new River Song.\nThe flood never came.\nIt did rain again, though, and the wind and the river flowed faster, strong currents rushing forward, instruments of perfect harmony.\nReshad Staitieh is from Kansas City.

We valued gold as well, for its allure to the gods and its power over humanity, and in the knowledge that those two often worked in concert. But above all we, the noble Iceni, valued our honor and would sacrifice both horses and gold to defend it.\nThe Romans took it all from us, and more.\nWe saw our widowed queen deprived of her inheritance and saw her stripped of her right to rule. We saw her flogged and tortured by the same Roman generals that her trustful husband had sought as his allies. We saw her forced to watch as drunken Roman troops threw lots for the privilege of robbing her daughters of their virginity.\nNot yet a mother myself, I had turned my back and tried to run from the sight of those children cruelly pinned to the ground, as they were brutally raped again and again by the victors. Even so, there was no way I could escape the terrible sounds of their pain and horror.\nWe were not the simple folk the Romans believed they could subjugate with their unspeakable actions. Tales of our disgrace swiftly brought allies to our side\u2014from our Trinovante kinsmen, their finest warriors; from the far-flung Druidic realms, shadowy multitudes emerging from the misty edges of the forest. Together, we rallied to the battle cry of our bruised and disgraced queen.\nBoudicca.\nHer very name spoke of victory to us, and we were not afraid.\nI was but one of the thousands amassed on the hillside overlooking Camulodunum, though certainly honored to stand in the ranks of the queen\u2019s elite, the women warriors of the Iceni. The once-sacred city below was barely recognizable to us, sullied with the hulking stonework and the vulgar manor houses of the usurpers. All the better; we would destroy the Roman monstrosity and rebuild on its ruins the sanctified Camulodunum of our memory.\nJust past dawn, the populace had begun to seep into the streets, groggily edging past each other, oblivious to our presence. Which of them glanced upward, perhaps to enjoy the glint of dawn light against the grassy slopes, and first spied our gathered horde? What did they think when they saw our thousands amassed on the hillside beyond the city they had come to think of as their own? Did they snicker at our chariots, built of rough-hewn wood and shielded with straw? Did they assume us uncultured fools for bestowing our horses with golden bits and coin-spangled harnesses while our warriors faced battle in the same coarse cloaks in which they plowed our fields? What did they think when they saw our Boudicca, standing proud and tall in her humble chariot, her tawny hair and the gold of her royal armor both aflame in the rays of the rising sun?\nWe could not help but admire her fiery glory, but even we were awestruck by the presence of her daughters to either side of her, the same so horribly abused by our adversaries only months before. In the radiance about those children we read the gods\u2019 confirmation of the virtue of our cause. Boudicca had placed an arm over the shoulders of each and gathered them to her in the affectionate gesture observed in the most ordinary of mothers. Then she called to us, her husky, graveled tones rising above our murmurs, silencing our impatient susurrus.\n\u201cI am not the first woman to lead our peoples to war,\u201d she shouted, \u201cand I do not intend to be the last.\u201d A spontaneous cheer rose from the throats of the Iceni women at the sound of our traditional call to battle.\n\u201cThe Romans are not of the same mind as us on this matter; their wars are led and fought by men alone.\u201d She paused, and then continued in a heightened voice. \u201cThe Romans are not of the same mind as us on many things. They dishonor the memory of the dead; they rob us of land and livelihood. They humiliate and degrade us in the name of their laws.\u201d\nShe paused again, lowering her head to murmur some words to her daughters.\n\u201cThey savagely steal the innocence of our children, and call it a victory for Rome.\u201d\nAnother roar rose up, across the hillside, among the Iceni and among our allies, man and woman, warrior and priest alike.\n\u201cWe go into this war for the honor and the freedom of our people; vast numbers of our warriors have amassed for the fight. Despite the obvious virtue of our cause and our trust in the might of our forces, each of our warriors must go into this battle acknowledging the possibility of their death. Only by choosing to fight to the death will we find the courage for victory!\u201d\nWith these words, Boudicca nodded to a triad of druids standing to the side of her chariot. They climbed on behind her, each carrying a large, covered ironwork bowl. The eldest of them, a gaunt man with weatherworn skin and silver-gray hair, uncovered his bowl and set it beside her. Then our queen nodded to us, her Iceni warriors. We moved forward at her command.\n\u201cMy warriors do not fight to their death without the blessings of the gods,\u201d she said. Reaching into the bowl, she grabbed handfuls of the contents and flung them up over our heads.\nA shower of gold shimmered in the early rays of sunlight and seemed to hang in the air for a moment before raining down on us. Hundreds of coins offered, as was our way, first to the gods, and by them bestowed back on a precious few as signs of their blessing, marking the elite among the Iceni warriors thus divined to be the first into battle.\nWe leapt and scrambled. All around, my comrades claimed their gleaming talismans, but I was not among the chosen. I stepped aside as they formed ranks in front of us; I cheered these coin-bearers on as they marched down the slope. Left behind, I watched in silence from the hillside as they neared the city and the battle began in earnest.\nI watched my sisters and brothers in combat cut through the city\u2019s hastily arrayed defenders, ferociously slashing at them with stout Iceni blades. I saw them send Roman opponents into retreat with little more than the grisly promise of their bloodthirsty presence.\nBefore long, I also saw Iceni comrades fall, mortally wounded at the hands of Romans who had not forgotten how to fight. I saw my comrades clutch at wounds, stagger back to their feet, heave and fall again. I watched their motionless bodies trampled as the fight went on about them.\nAnd then I saw the bodies of dead Iceni begin to stir again, their arms and legs jerking stiffly. I saw them rear back on their haunches, and rise from the ground, awkwardly clutching their weapons. I watched fallen comrades lurch back into the fray, snuffling the air like wild beasts. I saw the dead come back to life and hunt down their killers.\nI watched as they feasted on hands, arms, legs, Roman blood dripping from their mouths. I saw them snuffle the air again, only temporarily sated, and pursue the nearest Roman for another gruesome feast.\nI once again turned my back on the horrors before me, hoping to control my revulsion. Within moments I turned back, realizing that the strongest emotion I faced was not horror, but envy. How I longed to be among the walking Iceni dead in Camulodunum, wreaking upon the Romans a consequence more gruesome than they had delivered onto us!\nIn the thought of it, I stole a glance at the gracious Boudicca. Our queen stared, not at the battle below but into the sky above. I followed her gaze and perceived a twinkling presence in the light of the rising sun. A field of coins hung glittering in the air. In the space of a breath, they dropped in a shower of gold over the Iceni still standing on the hillside.\nA single glittering coin dropped squarely into my opened palm. I gasped and stared at it for the briefest moment, and then, in unison with my neighbors, I raised the god-blessed gold into the air.\nWe ran, shrieking, into battle.\nFor the Iceni! For justice!\nWe die, and rise again, for victory!\nMarlys Jarstfer grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but writes and lives in not-quite-rural Massachusetts with her very own furniture-maker and a twenty-year-old cat in yet another gray-painted house.

I am used to the feeling of sweat dripping down my back, of dirt caked under my fingernails. I am adept at patting down the dirt over top of the holes in the grass to hide the evidence. Even if Dad notices the disturbed earth, sometimes the fact that I tried means he can look away.\nOccasionally, punishment is more bother than it\u2019s worth.\nAnd when school is canceled for the time being and no one knows when they\u2019ll let us back to learn something new, what\u2019s better than poking around the garden for Armadillidium vulgare? You probably know them as pill-bugs. I like to watch the way they curl up at my touch like miniature armadillos.\nOh, I guess that\u2019s how they got their name. Cool.\nLately the soil is too dry to find earthworms or pill-bugs, but ants are just as interesting. Did you know that ants lived at the same time as dinosaurs, and that wood ants can squirt acid to kill their enemies? If I could shrink to their size I\u2019d explore their dens, following the maze through dirt downward, far down below the surface, ducking my head in tunnels designed for six-legged creatures.\nSo when you spend this much time in the backyard, you notice the trees are moving. Just a little bit, every week. Slightly closer to that clump of maiden clover. Farther away from that dark stain on the wood fence.\nI don\u2019t see them move during the day, so it has to be at night. Everything interesting happens after bedtime. When I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m going to stay up all night, like my cat Smoke, who is nocturnal\u2014I will stay awake even later than the fireworks on New Year\u2019s Eve, even later than the witching hour. I\u2019m going to see it all.\nFor now, I can\u2019t see the trees walk, but I can measure. I can gather evidence.\nI stretch out my tape measure carefully, tugging at the yellow metal. If I let it recoil too quickly it can slice my hands. But if I press the button on the side, it stays extended. It\u2019s obedient.\nSmoke is not, and I nudge her out of the way twice, scratching behind her ears.\nToday the trunk of our oak tree is thirteen feet, eight and one-quarter inches from the back door of our house. Yesterday it was eight and two-quarters, or one-half. I told you they moved slowly. You might think, Isa\u2019s just measuring wrong, small distances like that are tricky, and with one day\u2019s measurements you might be right. But what about over a month? Two months?\nWhat about not just our backyard, but every yard on our street?\nI document the measurements in my coil notebook, pencil scratching on dull pages, before calling Smoke and heading inside. Dinner tonight is pork with canned potatoes and peas. We eat in silence, and I don\u2019t share my findings yet. Mom and Dad have stopped asking me questions at the dinner table. There are no test scores or field trips to report on, and it\u2019s too hot to waste saliva on speech.\nI miss the crisp, green taste of vegetables fresh from our garden. Everything we eat now is metallic and dry and I have to chew each bite eight times before I swallow. I don\u2019t complain.\n* * *\nI tell Mom that Smoke isn\u2019t waking up, that he\u2019s sleeping in the middle of the backyard and won\u2019t come in for his breakfast or lift his head.\nI know he\u2019s dead, but the concept of mortality is one my parents still avoid. When Nan died they told me she was going on a trip to heaven or outer space or something and she left her body behind because she didn\u2019t need it anymore. Yeah, right.\nI don\u2019t think Smoke can go anywhere if his body is totally exsanguinated. That\u2019s a word I learned from this old show called The X-Files I saw on Netflix. It means drained of blood, like a vampire did it. Or embalmed, like the Egyptians did it. That\u2019s Smoke: a mummy but without the wrappings. Dry and drained and empty of life.\nAt bedtime I can\u2019t stop crying, I miss him so much. Smoke slept on my pillow every night and now it feels too big for just my head.\n* * *\nI\u2019m not supposed to sneak into the neighbors\u2019 backyards.\nObviously I know that but I play ignorant. Plausible deniability. I learned that from Mom\u2019s lawyer shows. Never plead guilty. Unless\u2014when is a discovery more important than getting in trouble? Do I tell them I was measuring the trees? Do I tell them that in every yard on our street, the trees have been moving closer and closer to the houses, oak and maple and avocado and orange? Do I tell them that Mrs. O\u2019Dea\u2019s yard contains two dead squirrels, exsanguinated like Smoke, now only dried rugs of fur and skin and rodent-face?\nI don\u2019t think so. Mom and Dad don\u2019t often believe me. I guess that\u2019s my own fault: when I was four I told them about dinosaurs in the river and when I was seven it was extended conversations with Smoke about the nature of humanity versus cat-manity. Apparently cats don\u2019t talk to adults. Their loss.\nYou know that story of crying wolf from Aesop? Maybe that\u2019s me. I have quite the imagination, Dad says. It is not a compliment. I need to learn to control my instincts, to check my desire to tell stories, even if they\u2019re interesting. I need to respect the gates of suburban backyards.\nMrs. O\u2019Dea helps me bury the evidence. I think she needs the squirrel funeral more than I do, but we pretend it\u2019s for me, since Mom wouldn\u2019t let me watch while Dad buried Smoke. The small mound of dry dirt Dad left behind is not as well disguised as my own explorations. Every time I look out in the yard, past the wilted tomato plants and fallen leaves, crisp and brown too early in spring, I see it and think of Smoke.\nMrs. O\u2019Dea had tamed some of the squirrels and given them names, Jamie and Brownie and Sadie; she hand-fed them sunflower seeds. She cries at the funeral and rubs at the tears on her wrinkled cheeks with a scarf the same gray as her hair. It was given to her by a former student and is more tatters than fabric. She pats me on the shoulder, she says there, there, even though my eyes are dry.\nI\u2019m not imagining things. Today our oak tree is thirteen feet, seven inches from the door. It has moved a whole inch overnight.\n* * *\nThe thing about digging for bugs in the backyard is you get dirty. And now it\u2019s not so easy to get clean\u2014our shower doesn\u2019t last very long and sometimes Mom has to shout for me: Bella, Isa-belle-belle, fetch me a bucket of water!\nToday there\u2019s shampoo in her hair, all white and foamy, how I imagine the sea. But when I turn on the kitchen tap it sputters, it spurts dark mud and then dry sand into the sink.\nI open the fridge. I want to obey, I want to do what Mom has asked me, but do I take one of the bottles of water? I know they\u2019re for drinking, they\u2019re pure, with no sulfur or any of the other minerals she hates. Would she want to pour it over her hair and let most of it seep down the drain? I scan the shelves of the fridge for a reasonable substitute. The fridge light sputters.\nI take her a cup full of apple juice.\nIt\u2019s the wrong choice. Now Mom and Dad are both furious and Mom\u2019s hair is sticky. I offer to forfeit my shower to her this week and it doesn\u2019t help. I am sent to bed with no shower and no glass of water. On my too-large pillow I count sheep, chasing sleep as my dry, blistered tongue scrapes across my teeth.\n* * *\nYou know what\u2019s the best for not thinking about people or cats you miss? Empirical investigation. My measurements are exact and I triple check them, scrawling dark charcoal numbers in my notebook. Our oak tree is eleven feet from the back door.\nEvery backyard I sneak into has at least one dried, mummified squirrel or sparrow. Seven out of seven. One hundred percent.\nAt least twice a week a white van is parked in front of another neighbor\u2019s house on our small street, repairing internet cables that have been damaged by roots.\nNow I have evidence, so I need a hypothesis. The imaginative part of my brain, the crying-wolf part, says maybe the trees are just dancing at night, just having fun, because why can\u2019t plants enjoy their lives like people do? But that\u2019s not much of a hypothesis because it doesn\u2019t answer this: Why are they always moving closer to our house? Why are they always closer to the neighbors\u2019 houses? Why are the animals dying?\nOn television the news station has the number of days since the last rain up the corner of the screen. A drought is defined as a long period without rain, but who decides how much that is? My research says that in northern England it can be fifteen days, but here in the western United States it can be seven months.\nBlue numbers in the corner of the TV screen flash 226.\nAcross the street, the tall maple\u2019s yellowing leaves seem to reach out, almost touching Mrs. O\u2019Dea\u2019s windows. She is out there on a ladder snipping off its branches with cutting shears. The twigs snap easily, falling to the ground.\nShe burns them in a pile in her backyard and the grass catches on fire. She calls the fire department and is so embarrassed. They are under city regulation not to use water, so now they are out there in her yard, four men in red uniforms and yellow fiberglass hats, smothering the fire with a blanket, stamping around on the ground, dancing on the grass to kill the flames.\nI do a rain dance in our backyard at the same time, copying them, asking the cloudless sky to send us moisture. I flail my arms and throw my legs in the air. It\u2019s pretty fun. It would be more fun if Smoke were here to dance with me.\n* * *\nThere\u2019s no water in our toilet. My urine is dark yellow and comes in spurts. It burns as I pee and the pain makes my tear ducts itch. I don\u2019t have tears left. When I press the handle, nothing flushes the urine down.\nBut there is something else in the bottom of the basin. Long, pale white strands like skinny fingers reach up from the pipes. They look familiar, and I remember the copy of Gray\u2019s Anatomy I found at a garage sale: they are splitting off like dendrites in the human nervous system, like flower roots reaching downward into the garden. Like tree roots.\nMaybe the trees are just as thirsty as we are.\nI close the toilet lid, and when I check back an hour later, the strands are gone, and so is the yellow liquid.\n* * *\nMrs. O\u2019Dea was eighty-three years old, Dad says. He doesn\u2019t tell me anything about heaven now, the way he did with Nan. Maybe that means I\u2019m more grown up. I don\u2019t feel more grown up.\nHe says it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that Mrs. O\u2019Dea died. It was her time. She was old, she was useless, she had nothing left to give to this world.\nI don\u2019t believe him. I stop listening, I do powers of three in my head, my brain shouting to drown out his words.\nShe was kind to me, she loaned me books by Madeleine L\u2019Engle and Lois Lowry and John Green, she taught me that math works even if it involves a constant that isn\u2019t a number, she told me that if I was ever scared of my parents, really scared, I should come and knock on her door no matter how late it was. Even if it was past the witching hour.\nShe gave a lot to me, even if I am not the whole world.\nWhen Nan died, at her funeral they put makeup on her cheeks and her skin was gray, but she still looked like Nan if I squinted. When I found Mrs. O\u2019Dea in her yard (illegally, disobeyingly, trespassing even though I promised not to) her wrinkled skin had collapsed on her cheekbones and she was thinner than I had ever seen her, her sweater and jeans loose on her body, as if the fat had just vanished into the atmosphere. Evaporated. Exsanguinated. I tried not to look at her once-green eyes. They weren\u2019t eyes anymore, and her lids were small and deflated.\nWhen I found her I screamed and screamed and I don\u2019t think I stopped screaming until the ambulance sirens continued the sound for me.\nNow Dad has given up consoling me but Mom is trying to get me to look away as the paramedics come to remove Mrs. O\u2019Dea\u2019s body. I press my hands to my face as if I\u2019m hiding and I peek between the fingers. I don\u2019t want to see it but I cannot ignore the possibility of more data points for my research. Where is my notebook?\nIt takes two paramedics to lift her onto the stretcher. She sticks to the ground like a spider on flypaper, eight legs tearing from its body slowly as it tries to rise, one by one by one.\nOne paramedic asks the other, what the fuck are those? As he lifts Mrs. O\u2019Dea\u2019s bare arm from the dead grass, thin strands hold her to the dirt and break as he pulls.\nMom\u2019s hands are a vise on my own arm and she drags me away\u2014I think she\u2019s angrier about the profanity than the death\u2014but I can hear the other man say, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re coming from the ground. Worms or parasites or something. Don\u2019t touch \u2019em. Get some tweezers and grab a sample.\nBut I know the worms in our neighborhood are long gone, dried up and dead in the parched soil. It has been at least four weeks since I have encountered anything from suborder Lumbricina. It has been days since I have seen many of my neighbors, and at least half the houses on our street have gone dark.\nWhen I get home I don\u2019t think about my friend Mrs. O\u2019Dea, I just find my measuring tape and I get to work. Mom watches me from the back deck, her face all scrunched up, worried or mad I can\u2019t tell. Our oak tree is five feet from the house. It has moved halfway across the yard! I look back at Mom and I announce out loud, five feet from the back door, but she doesn\u2019t answer.\nWhy do Mom and Dad ignore my findings? Who do they think moved it? Or do they know that trees can move by themselves? Sometimes I wonder if I am wasting my time, if I should stop trying to make sense of the world, when really it\u2019s just that adults haven\u2019t bothered to explain it all yet.\n* * *\nI am supposed to be asleep, but my bedroom window is open and I hear Dad outside talking to Mr. Zhang from the house across the street. He\u2019s one of the few who hasn\u2019t packed his car full, tying suitcases to the roof, driving away.\nI peer out the window, and although electricity to the street lamps failed weeks ago and the white van has stopped coming, the moon is bright tonight so I can see the men in the darkness. Dad is leaning on the fence, marking his territory. I know he misses the lush green grass that Mom always called proof of his virility.\nWhat I hear is this: Mrs. O\u2019Dea\u2019s whole body was full of what the paramedics said were fibrous strands of plant or fungal origin. The strands pierced small holes in her skin and followed her veins and arteries. All of the blood in her body was gone, replaced by a twisting system of roots that ran from her head to her toes.\nI carefully note this in my book. My penmanship has declined, I am not as scientifically detached as when I began this investigation, but I am resolved: in the morning, if Mom and Dad will not listen to me, I\u2019ll take it to Mr. Zhang or another neighbor. Or I\u2019ll walk the seventeen blocks to school and see if anyone is there, maybe a custodian who knows how to contact one of my teachers.\n* * *\nWhen the trees make their next move overnight, it is so swift that I don\u2019t have to worry about explaining anything.\nThe television and internet cables have failed but my iPod has a bit of battery left and the radio reports that bodies are everywhere, drained of fluids: animals, humans, anyone outside during the dark hours. The police have donned riot gear. A town in western Arizona has burned to the ground, no survivors. Speculation is the community took matters into their own hands and spread gasoline on the trees, then lit a match. Everyone wants the president to make a speech, but no one can find him.\nEarly in the morning I hear Mom and Dad arguing, so I stay in bed with my sheet drawn over my head. The heat of it is suffocating. They throw words at each other sharp as breaking plates: too fucking late, nowhere to go, what the fuck do you expect me to do?\nIt is not fantasy or crying wolf, unless we are all still asleep and sharing the same child\u2019s nightmare.\n* * *\nStep away from the sink, Isabella, Mom says. I let my hand with the tape measure drop to my side. It shakes against my dirt-encrusted jeans. For so long I documented the trees\u2019 movements for posterity, for curiosity, but I\u2019d always thought of our home as safe, impenetrable from the outside, the only danger from my own defiance within.\nAround our neighborhood we see vines breaking through masonry, roots crawling up through pipes. The trees are moving so much more quickly than one inch a night. Every time we close our eyes, every time we blink, the roots draw closer.\nThe butter-voiced man on the radio says that people are fleeing to cities, to the tallest apartment buildings, to man-made structures higher than any tree. On the coast, they are piling onto boats. I cannot imagine their abundance of water, even if it is saturated with salt. There is a pounding in my head that never quiets.\nThe toilets have been dry for days, and we don\u2019t sit on them any more\u2014the bowls are full of white, grasping roots. We pee in a bucket, and we cover the bucket with tinfoil. I have learned the trick of not splashing over the edges, though at first Mom and I used crudely made funnels.\nWe have three small bottles of water left.\nThe smell of urine curls my lip and fills every corner of our home. I can taste it, dry and acidic, on my tongue. When I ask why we don\u2019t dump it outdoors, I feel Dad\u2019s fist before I see it, impact and stumbling back, my head hitting the edge of the kitchen stove. It is the first time he has done that in a long while, and it shocks me. On the floor I press my cheek to the cool tile and curl up into a ball. My eyes burn, craving tears.\nWhen he leaves the room in disgust, Mom whispers an answer to my question: we might need it later.\nThere was this old text-based video game that kids played in the 1980s, in a whole different millennium when water filled backyard swimming pools, when they had mattresses made of liquid that you could sink into at night. It was called Oregon Trail. It\u2019s been updated online. In the new version of the game, before the pilgrims turn to cannibalism they drink their own urine. The kids in my class at school thought the game was funny, and so did I. Addison wore a T-shirt that proudly proclaimed: \u201cYou have died of dysentery.\u201d\nRoots rise between the tiles of our kitchen floor. They have taken over our sinks and bathtubs in ratty nests of brambles. Dad gives me his lighter, the pewter one reserved just for his pipe that I am not permitted to touch, and he tells me to burn them. He and Mom retreat to the top of stairs several feet above me as I bend down on the kitchen floor, flicking the lighter, holding it with my arm stretched out before me like a shield.\n* * *\nThe thinnest roots burn, crackling and turning to gray ash before my eyes. Past the walls of our house, I think maybe I can hear our oak tree screaming. It\u2019s not something I can measure in decibels, not something I can record in my notebook. But I feel it in my head somewhere, slithering in through my ear canals, snaking along my sinuses, vibrating in the red marrow of my skull.\nThe sound reminds me of Smoke as she slept, caught in a nightmare, trapped in the secret past of a rescue cat that I will never know. I\u2019d wake her and sometimes she would be grateful and cuddle against my chest, purring and desperate for contact. Other times I\u2019d startle her and she\u2019d scratch my arm, drawing bright blood. I didn\u2019t blame her; I know what it\u2019s like to wake from a nightmare not understanding I am safe in bed.\nBut when Mom told me that if that damned cat scratched me one more time she\u2019d get rid of it, I stopped waking Smoke. Was that selfish, to leave my cat to her night terrors rather than chance I be left alone? She died anyway, her blood drained by trees. I wish I hadn\u2019t let her last months be filled with bad dreams.\nOnce upon a time I loved our oak tree. I would run my hands over its trunk and count it a friend. Quercus kelloggii. The depth of its gray bark, the texture of it, reminded me that we have choices beyond who we are on the surface. We have dreams beyond our current lives.\nWhy does it deserve to die of thirst more than we do? Who am I to decide its fate?\nBut I flip back the pewter lid from the lighter again. I roll up a newspaper and set it aflame to conserve the lighter\u2019s fuel, and I hold my new torch next to the intruder breaking through our kitchen floor.\n* * *\nAll of this burning has given me courage. I ask my parents: Why didn\u2019t we run? Why can\u2019t we run still? The trees can\u2019t be everywhere. If they want moisture, if they\u2019ve drained all the squirrels and pets and the birds have flown high above this drought-stricken world and found somewhere new to be, why don\u2019t we take to the paved streets and find cities built without green?\nBut Mom and Dad answer: This is our home. This is our house, the house we\u2019ve purchased, the house on which we\u2019ve paid off almost thirty-five percent of the mortgage. We will not abandon our property. Dad tosses our last empty bottle of water on the floor, crushing the plastic beneath his foot.\nWe gather in the room that is farthest from any waterworks, away from the laundry with its pipes, away from the kitchen with its sink, and away from the bathroom, most dangerous of all, a coffin of toilet plumbing and sink drain and showerhead birthing reaching, grasping tendrils.\nTonight we have run out of lighter fluid, we have run out of matches. There may be gas left in the stove, but I can\u2019t get near it, the kitchen is a twisting mess of inhuman life.\nI use a pair of scissors to cut off a long chunk of my hair and show Mom how to start a fire with dry hair, steel wool, and the battery from our smoke detector. We burn the roots that have filled the stairway leading to our bedrooms. They crackle orange and gold in the dark. We burn them until I am nearly bald.\nDad insults Mom\u2019s pageboy cut, the one he pointed to last year on an actress in a magazine.\n* * *\nWe gather in my bedroom, which is farthest from the master en suite and any source of water. Mom leans on me to walk. We are silent, with swollen, dry tongues and blistered cheeks. We have left the last bucket of urine, one-eighth full, as a distraction in the kitchen, hoping to herd the roots there for one more night of sleep before we determine our next move. Mom says that all she can think about now is closing her eyes.\nI pee into a coffee mug and Dad presses his lips to the cup, ravenous.\nWe huddle on my bed together, and now the pillow is too small\u2014it cushions Mom\u2019s head and Dad\u2019s head, but I lean my own on Mom\u2019s chest. She heaves shallow, quick breaths full of fear. Eventually, she sleeps.\nBy morning there are tree roots reaching under my bedroom door.\nI don\u2019t wake my parents. Technically, I am obedient: many months ago, back when there was school and earthworms and salads filled with tangerines that squirted juice as I bit into them, they told me never to wake them early. The weekend was theirs alone, and Smoke and I should amuse ourselves. Those orders have never been countermanded. Smoke and I rose earlier and earlier on Sunday mornings, living out our fantasies: we were explorers crawling on our bellies through tall grass in the park, we were mathematicians using pebbles to solve ancient puzzles, we were best friends together forever.\nSo I don\u2019t wake them as I escape, as I open the small window in my room to make a gap that only I can squeeze through, that would never fit an adult body. I don\u2019t wake them as I fall on the crisp, brittle grass, the farthest corner from our oak tree.\nI glance back at the house and wish I hadn\u2019t. My former home is unrecognizable: I cannot tell our tree from the neighbors\u2019 trees, there are branches and roots reaching in through every cracked window, prying open the spaces between wood panels. The back of our house is hidden beneath masses of grasping plants. But they don\u2019t extend toward the road. There is no life, no moisture, on the pavement.\nAlthough I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going and I am dizzy with thirst, I pull open our gate, I tread over a garden of dead daffodils, I stumble toward the road, and I begin to run.\nLeanne Olson is a librarian and writer from Ontario, Canada.

Her hands are women\u2019s hands, but these hips have never held a child. Her thighs remember dragons, her feet foreign oceans. She does not know her name. She knows too many. Each bone sings the telling of a different war.\nFor some time, she cannot move.\nAt last, when the shouting mountains settle, when the oceans quell their roar and the dragon-fires dim on her tongue, the many-named comes aware of another in the room. This woman wears wool and rabbit, as simple and clean as the rough-hewn hall around them. She walks with the quick-quiet step of midwives, from hearth to table and back again\u2014brewing and cutting, the many-named sees, watching from her low bed of furs.\nShe recognizes this woman\u2019s brewing from the baskets and pockets of her girlhood. In the same moment, she knows these plants never grew on her home shores.\nHv\u00f6nn, she names, stune and sti\u00f0e, worm-bitten and frost-got, browning beneath cellar twine.\nStill, the woman cuts, and cutting, sings\u2014a breath of winds and runes over the back of an owl\u2019s skull\u2014and frost-shadows green with each beckoned word, leaves rising, whole and unhurt, twining for the knife.\nThe many-named watches, sore and strange, feeling kinship with battered green.\nAt last, the woman brings her a thin broth, seared leek and bear, strong as granite.\n\u201cFor strength,\u201d she says. She folds their hands together around the bowl until, after a time, the many-named can lift her arms again.\nWhen the bowl empties, the woman asks, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\nRoots and bears waking in her belly, the many-named answers in a voice of centuries, \u201cI am Eldr. I am R\u00e1n. I am Fjall.\u201d\n* * *\nSoon, others of the village arrive. They stoop through the woman\u2019s low doorway, knocking snow from their shoulders, arms laden with gifts.\nThey give her pelts to see her through the ice winds, well-used and precious. They give her boots of salmon-skin to keep the water out, pack her feet in elk and rabbit to guard against the cold. They decorate her arms with oaths, fill her hands and belts with blades.\n\u201cThe wolves have caught the sun,\u201d they tell her, and each gift marks a child lost, a larder barren. \u201cUntil they are killed, this winter will not end.\u201d\nAt the end of an hour, her strength returned and eyes sharp, they point her to a distant mountaintop.\nSilent as the snowdrifts, the many-named chooses her way.\n* * *\nOnce outside the unfamiliar village, memories tangle and overlap. Where her neighbors built their homes, the many-named climbs hills. She crosses a field remembering trees, and passes between snow-laden branches where once grass lapped like water in the wind.\nStill, she knows this place. She recalls the names of familiar knolls, of fields and long-armed trees. She finds her way like a crow coming home, walks a row of heavy spruce\u2014slender-limbed in her long-ago memory\u2014and descends into her barrow.\nThe many-named slips like a ghost between the bones of strangers and ancestors, her torchlight dancing in their watchful eyes.\nShe remembers these chambers, remembers carrying her grandmother into the stone, carrying her mother. She walks the path through which her daughters carried her, stands in the place where her sons broke her quartz knife over her breast, and regards what remains of her body on the bier.\nShe is Eldr, daughter of Vald, warrior of Hronn. She wore leashed dragons on her arms, wrote her story there in woad, in gold. She hammered this knife herself, wrested free a forest\u2019s gilded tooth and wrapped the root in silvered bronze.\nYet, she is R\u00e1n, daughter of no woman, swum from a long-distant shore. This knife and these bones mean nothing to her. She knows the shape of a seal skin and the taste of sea. She visited the serpent of the world in his den beneath the waves and recognized her father\u2019s smile on his scaly face.\nShe is Fjall, son of mountains, a king woken in the breast of rock. Even now, she hears the murmuring earth, spinning a tale of decades in its slow, heavy speech. Words of obsidian and shale rest heavy on her tongue, gneiss and limestone weight her cheeks.\nThe many-named knows her own legends, has sat before fires as a child, reciting old battles, learning names to call dead dragons.\nAnd yet, and yet\u2014\nThe many-named trails her finger through the abandoned bowl of her hips where her children once slept. She palms the marbled bones of her ankles, worn by mountains and weathered by oceans. She remembers other bones, other mountains, other oceans. Three old warriors crowd in her borrowed skin, teeth bared and aching.\nThe many-named tastes the remnants of her gravesong on the air of her barrow\u2014sweet as sirens\u2014and wants nothing more than to lay this body down. But though she longs for earth, these strangers summoned her with purpose and bound her with their need. She can no more rest now than she can return her bones to every pilfered grave.\nSo instead, she lifts the two halves of her knife from each abandoned hand, binds the blade to shaft with the slender edge of an oath-band. And so armed, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall climbs from her barrow, shoulders taut, moon-silvered, hunting sun.\n* * *\nShe sheds the blessing-gifts of the people as she walks, scattering rings and arm-locks to glitter golden among the fallen needles of spruce and pine. She dresses her childhood trees in borrowed pelts, returns bear skins to bear dens. Even her boots she leaves neatly stacked and waiting against the base of a mossed runestone, to feel the shadow-dappled snow and ice-packed mud pressing at her toes.\nLike a mother coming home from war, she folds her face in this too-long winter, and the storm bows from her path.\nShe was born from mountains once, kinged and crowned in ice.\nShe walks on.\n* * *\nAt the peak of the mountain, she finds fenriswolves circling like an unfamiliar sky. Crooked jawed, star-toothed and grinning, their barrow-black lips drip with rivers. Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall walks between them, unhindered, the pack parting and joining like water, rivulets of salivated ice crunching beneath her bare feet.\nShe follows their current to the largest wolf, seated on an outcropping of sturdy rock. Faint fingers of light creep over the rise behind him, flashing in his fur.\nThe sun, she thinks, trapped and dying in the valley between peaks.\nThe many-named bows her head in respect. \u201cSkoll,\u201d she says, recalling old wars and the scars ringing his lips.\nAt his name, the beast smiles, shards of sunblood glistening in his maw. \u201cGreetings,\u201d he growls. And then, \u201cAre you hungry, cousin?\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall frowns. Standing before wolves, she rakes her history, combing the spotted backs of three centuries to make sense of such a title. \u201cCousin?\u201d she asks at last.\nThe wolf turns his head, a jagged, ill-matched curl of lips.\n\u201cWe know you a little,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all old monsters here.\u201d\nThe many-named considers this. She had not considered herself monstrous, but then, she must be\u2014three warriors and three centuries buttered between her bones. The thought does not disturb her. She has ridden dragons, slayed and tamed and worn a hundred beasts. To be named monster\u2014well, there is power in monstrosity.\nSo Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall smiles. She roots herself in fires and seas and mountains, holds her history like a talisman in two waiting fists, and says, \u201cI come to free the sun.\u201d\nGrowling, the wolves coil closer, teeth catching moon-light. Skoll shakes his head. \u201cNo. It is ours by rights. We were denied our feast.\u201d\n\u201cThey offer us nothing, but bid the sun to rise,\u201d a she-wolf snarls, advancing but wary. \u201cHow can we give up this chase when our pups howl with hungry bellies?\u201d\n\u201cWinter cannot end without blood,\u201d another rumbles, teeth shining, close enough to feel her breath. \u201cThere must be blood. There must be meat!\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall nods. She thinks of the village at the mountain\u2019s feet, their need-fetter tight around her throat. She understands. Charred leek and bear weigh bitter in her stomach.\n\u201cThen I will bring you both,\u201d she says, and returns the way she came.\n* * *\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall finds a hart flickering between the trees, chewing bark and kicking roots. Loping silent through the forest behind it, she brings it down with a whispered knife between the oath-band loops of its spine. Its body balanced on her shoulders, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall climbs the mountain again.\nShe stops at the edge of the pack\u2019s den and guts the hart, separating viscera and entrails into tidy piles, sweet and steaming, all within reach of her knife. Soon, the wolves circle, stomachs rumbling on sunlight. But Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall smiles with the teeth of wolves and black-bright eyes of foxes; they dare not come too close.\nShe is monstrous. She is kin. They will not risk her claws.\nAt last, a shadow prowls close enough to ask, \u201cYour price?\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall nods to the sun sparks limping over the mountain\u2019s rim.\nThe wolves look to each other. In a moment, they agree.\n\u201cThere is blood,\u201d they say. \u201cThere is meat.\u201d\nSo she trades them the hart\u2014lean though it is\u2014for the slow-gleam sun, simmering in the valley between their silver-toothed mountains. Like a thief, it slinks into the sky at her back as Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall descends the mountain. The need-fetter slips from her throat as she walks, and though she swallows freely, her strength fails with the growing light, each step a small new exhaustion.\nBefore long, Skoll walks at her side, his shoulder warm and heavy against her hip, his lips as yet unstained with living blood.\n\u201cHunt with us,\u201d he says, gentle. \u201cLive. Eat. We will teach you to hold the sun in your teeth.\u201d\nThe many-named smiles. She shakes her head. Beads of ice ring in her hair, even as dawn heats her back.\n\u201cNo, cousin,\u201d she says, though for him she holds a quiet gratitude. \u201cI have hunted enough.\u201d\nAnd crossing the border between mountain and trees, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall walks into the forest to die.\n* * *\nWhen the many-named wakes again, she wakes slowly, dozing in heat, sharp summer sunlight piercing her comforting chill. Thick water licks her fingers and anoints her eyes, smelling of old amulets, of stune and sti\u00f0e and something new.\nWhen at last her eyes open, this time, the many-named wakes alone.\nShe finds her body clean and nude in the flickering light of a near fire, her bones the same, but her flesh different. Now, she is again as dark as her earliest life\u2014dark as fire-keepers, ocean bellies, mountain deeps\u2014and though life itches like poison weed, the many-named finds it a small comfort to look down at her hands and see a shade she remembers.\nThis time, it takes little to relearn the strange flow of her new body, the bones rattling their history like coins between teeth. The many-named stands, strong and sturdy on her old-new legs. Barefoot, bare fleshed, she ignores the carefully sewn linens left folded by her makeshift bed and crosses to the longhouse door.\nOutside, a man and a woman stand ankle-deep in snow, identical in face and hair. Even the dark circles beneath their eyes match\u2014the slim line of crimson beneath the moons of their fingernails. They lean on each other, barely grown, sharing a single space. Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall reads the shadow-marks of ruin on their faces, too pale beneath the memory of paint.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d the woman breathes, a hope in her voice thin as dog-chewed hide.\nHer brother holds tightly to her hand. \u201cWelcome to the world again, Eldrr\u00e1n Fjall,\u201d he says.\nLike weaving sense from ash roots, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall untangles their accent, pieces their words together around the strange new cadence of her name. She smiles. She knows the way of legends, names and places weather-warped by many tellings.\nYears have buried her again, she thinks, and does not speak to correct these almost-children, swimming in magic and their own white cloaks. Hopefully, given enough time, the years will bury her completely.\nPalming sleep and earth from her eyes, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall says, \u201cSo you have need of me?\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cMonsters sleep in outside bay,\u201d the halves tell her, their language like wind-fish, bubbling and new. \u201cThey run every one aground. Until they are killed, our ships cannot return home.\u201d\nThey feed her\u2014 salmon for speed, crow for cunning\u2014and by afternoon, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall finds her feet and finds her way.\n* * *\nThe many-named takes nothing from them, and so, when she reaches water\u2019s edge, she has no skin to shed. Instead, she wraps herself in the memory of a lost pelt, smooth and fatted, and slips into the sea.\nThe weighted tides suck at her body, gnawing her new flesh with flat ice teeth. But once, the serpent beneath the world taught her which waves to breathe, and though these legs are new and different, they kick as heavy as her once-ago tail.\nShe was born from oceans once, cut her teeth with monsters singing men beneath the waves.\nShe swims on.\n* * *\nAt the throat of the inlet\u2014in the heart through which all ships must pass\u2014two women-serpents watch her approach, coiled tails winking H\u00f6\u00f0r\u2019s eyes in the frozen night-water.\n\u201cAnd now they send the many-named,\u201d one hisses, clenching claws.\n\u201cWhy do you come?\u201d demands the other. \u201cTo kill or to capture?\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall sinks to the water\u2019s bottom, pebbled with smooth-worked bones and the mossed remains of ships. Sand stirs up lost oaths beneath her toes, gold rings still vital in the living dark. And here and there, an empty-eyed warrior watches from beneath corroded shields\u2014a lost merchant stares between the still-sealed jars of his trade.\nShe holds no weapons, history or otherwise. She wears her knife\u2014her only treasure\u2014bound up in her hair.\n\u201cI come to bring the ships home,\u201d she says.\nThe serpent-women flash teeth red as their eyes. Minnows scatter from the seethe of their hair.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the first snarls. \u201cWe are grieving for our sister! Why may they return home\u2014they who stole her\u2014when she cannot?\u201d\nThe second coils. Bone beads run the length of her tail, chattering like teeth. \u201cShould drown you. Even seal-born cannot hold their breath forever.\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall turns her head, watches these two sisters, boiling like salmon in the current. And walking the belly of frozen water, facing another war, the many-named expects exhaustion. She feels the cold like a song, like a promise\u2014and true, she could sleep. She could close her eyes in the waves, escape to an eternity without witch women and twin halves.\nAnd yet.\nHere, beneath the world and waves, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall remembers a hundred roads\u2014unmarked, unnamed. She feels the edge of her need-fetter, strained by weight and water, not nearly so strong as the binding before, and she thinks, perhaps, she will walk again.\n\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cShe is dead,\u201d the serpent-women say.\nAnd empty handed, facing monsters, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall smiles. \u201cSo am I.\u201d\n* * *\nShe steps carefully through wreckages and into a high cave, twining between ragged sail ends and shattered chests until she finds the pieces of the serpent-woman, lolling like lost bottles on the ocean floor. Dead. Dead and done, but twice awake now and Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall has learned a little.\nPulling the knife from her hair, she unwraps the gold band that holds her handle to her blade. With a word of warming, she stretches it thin as thread, sharp and fine. She sings into the waves the songs that woke her, threads the wound with her history. Delicate as embroidery, she returns the serpent\u2019s head to her neck, breathes life into her\u2014sharing her own\u2014and does not feel its loss. The many-named burns like old fire, even among the ice of broken swords and ships.\nThe serpent-woman wakes smiling. Her smile is familiar, pockmarked and scaled as old mischief. Kin, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall thinks, though from which branch of which tree, she could not say.\nImmediately, the serpent-woman\u2019s sisters crowd to her, laughing and sobbing, tattooed arms twined around her new-scarred neck.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d they say, and, \u201cStay, stay. You are weak and wounded from your helping.\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall smiles, but declines. She could climb mountains. She could reclaim the skies.\n\u201cI thank you, but I will go,\u201d she says, and at this, the scarred serpent-woman pulls from the others. She faces Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall with grim-dark eyes, her face set in valleys.\n\u201cThey will foul you in nets,\u201d she says, voice like aching gravel. \u201cThey will bind you, claim you. You are a powerful prize. You will be owned and lost.\u201d\n\u201cI will be careful.\u201d\nStill, the serpent-woman speaks. \u201cThey will cut off your head to helm their ships. They will take your arms to decorate their mead-hall doors. They will wear your hide for armor. You will not survive it. Stay.\u201d\nAnd though it sounds like a promise, like the mountain-belly words of a seer, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall shakes her head. She has been too long gone from the world to fear the fates and faces of man.\n\u201cNo, sisters,\u201d she says, voice soft as shores. \u201cI carry too much fire. I would like to walk again.\u201d\nAnd slipping from the night-drenched cave, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall swims for sunlight.\n* * *\nShe returns first to the halves, though their need-fetter no longer holds her. A courtesy, she calls only to give them rest\u2014to offer a peace of mind she often missed in her three lives. Hearing the deed finished, the halves dip cups into the cauldron of mead bubbling over their fireplace, spiced and sweet.\n\u201cFor your success!\u201d they say, and they are joyous, eyes bright.\nIt would be rude not to drink.\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall accepts the cup, presses its heat against her blue-tipped fingers, thinking of roads and fires and flight.\nSmiling, together, they drink.\nA mouthful, a taste, and her vision blurs. The fire dies abruptly\u2014steals light, steals warmth. Blind in the dark, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall hears her cup shatter, slipped from her hand.\nAnd no more.\n* * *\nWhen she wakes again, it is to anger, to bog water, to blood filling her mouth and the stink of peat in every chamber of her heart. She wakes to a tight coil of sinew lodged in the hollow of her throat, to an unfamiliar prayer and dragon-scream in the far distance, though long ago, she watched the last dragon die.\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall rises. She breaks the sinew from her neck and sees at the edge of the bog a bearded man in white robes, standing over another on his knees, hand clenching her quartz knife, dripping red.\nAnd Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall is not tired.\nPast the blood and the peat she smells spell-work, sees the blue coils writhing above his hands. The bleeding body sinks into the shadowed water, eyes closed, neck gaping.\n\u201cWake, Eldr\u00e1n, son of Fjall,\u201d the man commands, reaching a hand for her. \u201cTake up your sword again. The witch Hamhleypa has raised a dragon!\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall stands, alone. She wears her skin differently dark\u2014earthen, now\u2014growing peat over granite bones, mossed breasts, and mountain flank. She gifts the man a moment\u2014a single crystalized instant of fear\u2014before she strikes him down, a single, heavy blow to his temple. Soon, he slides beneath the peat as well. The many-named watches him fall, her knife trapped in the cage of his hand, and lets them both go.\nQuietly, she kneels in muck and lifts the first body, carries the boy to higher, harder ground.\nWith earth-mooned fingers, she traces the gash her knife made along a throat too young yet for barbs or beard, and quietly, with whispers from the rocks and sea, she closes the wound. With words learned lifetimes ago, she sings the words to sink him in his skin again.\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall vomits bog. Her bones burn. Old daggers score her ribs, her new-won heart hammers fierce, defiant. Though she sings the owl song, though she howls with wolf-tongue the words to free a sun, though she tears at her bones and soul, she cannot return her stolen light. The boy remains dead, bloodied and peat-foul in her arms, and Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall understands that this death has happened before. It will happen again.\nHe, like her, is made for this.\nGently, the many-named wipes the muck from his eyes and shuts them against the bitter-bronze daylight.\nWhen she dies, he will rise again\u2014new body, new blood. Perhaps there is a sort of honor in it\u2014that when her arms decorate mead hall doors, he will take up swords. That when she lies rotten, he will live.\nUntil then, she lets the bog hold him.\nAgain, elsewhere, the dragon screams. Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall turns, muddied to her hips, and her eyes fall on a distant mountain, the shadow-marks of wings.\nDespite her blood and hurt, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall smiles.\nNone stand to stop her\u2014not with cups or swords.\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall lifts herself from the bog and walks. She sheds nothing as she goes, wearing proudly her bones and earth, carrying her mossy flesh like armor, like battle. With a few short words to bend the rocks her way, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall sinks her moss into crevices and scales the mountainside.\nThe wind blows a torrent around her, but the many-named steals it for a cloak. She has known fiercer winds and she cannot be cowed.\nShe was born from fire once, forged in dragons\u2019 flame.\nShe climbs on.\n* * *\nAt the peak of the mountain, she finds a beast like no other she has known before\u2014a furred and weighty dragon, a slow crest of sea erne feathers studding her brilliant jaw. Yet, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall knows her. Though she carries the blood of bears, wears the pelts of several horses, she cannot change her bones.\nThey remember the same winds, the same wars. Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall knows the heft of her wings as familiar as breathing. She knows the weight of that broad head, her heavy tail. She has borrowed these bones in battle. She once laid them to their rest. She neither knows nor cares who has assembled her again, only that she is assembled, only that she is here.\nLowering her massive, furred head, the dragon eyes her. \u201cOnce, your people would sacrifice warrior women to me\u2014for their crops and cows, their health.\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall taught her children to ride this back. They learned the webbing in these old wings before words. They drank her fire in their mother\u2019s milk.\n\u201cAnd once, your kin sacrificed dragons to me,\u201d she says, sewing old dragon speech together, tasting every spark. \u201cHearts for fine hunting, fire for gold.\u201d\nThe dragon cocks her head. \u201cYou are not quite woman.\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall nods. She steps closer. \u201cAnd you are not quite dragon.\u201d\nSlow as sunlit cats, the beast blinks, settles her chin on the flat edge of her tail. \u201cThen we are much the same,\u201d she says. Red eyes bright, she asks, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\nIn her voice, Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall hears slow-passed centuries. She hears the breath of history shared between them. She hears hope like worms\u2019 teeth gnawing ancient bones.\nShe hears family. She hears kin.\nShe has always been monstrous, whenever she lived.\n\u201cI know the answers to your old riddles,\u201d she says, gently, stepping forward. \u201cI know the places you itch. I know the names of your brood.\u201d\nFire curls at the dragon\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd the place to sink a sword.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Eldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall agrees. \u201cWe are old friends.\u201d\nThe dragon laughs. She blows old sword smoke over the many-named\u2019s earthen skin, sly tongue curled in humor. \u201cWe were carnelian queens, once\u2014gold and ruby kings. We could be again.\u201d\nEldr-R\u00e1n-Fjall remembers flying on leather wings. She remembers their daughters. She remembers songs and fire.\nShe remembers the scent of battlefields after a rain.\nLips pockmarked and imperfect, she looks out over the mountaintops and smiles. \u201cYes.\u201d\nCrystal Lynn Hilbert lives in the forgotten backwaters of Western Pennsylvania, subsisting mostly on old trade paperbacks and tea.

{"fingerprint":"NJaEUc1nSGvCCBUQPYW40y2Fo9I","title":"The Manatees","author":"Heather Kamins","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"I was the only one of my friends who had not yet been visited by the manatees. It was embarrassing. I was seventeen already.\nThey came to my friend Julie when she was only twelve. She was swimming in the pond by her grandparents\u2019 house, and the manatees showed up and told her of the three great loves she would have in her life: a wild, fiery affair early on; a long, steady relationship that would last decades; and a short but sweet love when she was old.\nThe manatees came to Sylvia in the creek that ran near her yard when she was fourteen. It was early winter, and they poked their heads up through the thin film of ice to describe a vision of courtrooms and justice. She had talked about becoming a judge before that, and the visit cemented it for her. Afterward, she spoke of her future career as though it were a certainty.\nAlicia saw them the following spring in a vernal pool in the woods. Amid the sound of the peeper frogs, the manatees delivered predictions of a tall, shining city she would visit. London or Tokyo or Paris, we couldn\u2019t be sure; she said that maybe she would travel to all of them someday, just to be safe.\nIt wasn\u2019t considered proper to discuss the manatees\u2019 predictions with other people, but every girl did it, in whispers at school and hushed conversations at sleepover parties. There was endless speculation about how to interpret this or that bit of the prophesy, endless parsing of each phrase they had said. During those conversations, I was torn. I was annoyed that we were constantly analyzing everyone else\u2019s experiences when I didn\u2019t have my own to talk about yet. I felt foolish and immature, with nothing to contribute to the discussion. And yet, I was fascinated because, like all the other girls, I, too, wanted to understand what it all meant.\nAnd so I listened and waited. Waited and waited. Even my younger sister had already been visited, in the pool at Aunt Shelly\u2019s house. She wouldn\u2019t tell me what they said, but she got a faraway look on her face and gave me a vague, smug smile any time I brought it up. I tried all the old tricks to make the manatees appear: tucking a sugar cube under my pillow, recording my dreams in a leather-bound notebook, tying a red ribbon around my ankle each morning. But nothing worked. Whenever I went anywhere near water, I searched for any sign of them, but still saw not even a ripple on the surface.\n* * *\nA month before my eighteenth birthday, I was lying in yet another bath gone lukewarm, more out of habit than out of hope. I\u2019d all but given up on showers, wanting to give the manatees as many pools of water as possible and, by extension, opportunities to show up. But I was starting to wonder if they would ever come. And what if they didn\u2019t? I was leaving for college in just a few months, but how could I go off and pretend to be an adult if I hadn\u2019t even seen them yet? You weren\u2019t a real woman until they showed up. Everybody knew that, and when my friends talked about their experiences, there was a growing sense of pity directed toward me. It was horrible. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll come soon,\u201d Julie would tell me, but we both knew she wasn\u2019t sure at all. I might very well go through my whole life as a manatee-less freak, a child with no direction or purpose, no understanding of how the world worked or what anything meant.\nRight when I was about to get out of the bathtub and towel off, I heard a gurgling noise coming from near the drain. Could it be? I looked down toward the bottom of the tub, not seeing anything at first, but then two round heads the size of peaches popped up above the surface of the water and looked at me, one by each of my feet. The manatees were smaller than I expected, and I wondered if they were always that size, or if it depended on the girl they were visiting. I waited for them to say something, but they continued staring at me, unmoving. I supposed it was up to me to start the conversation. \u201cHow did you two get in here?\u201d I asked, goose bumps rising on my damp, naked body. I folded my arms over my chest.\n\u201cWe came in through the drain,\u201d they said in unison. Their voices were soft, like those of old women or shy children.\n\u201cBut how?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWe live in the fluid,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThe bath?\u201d\nThey splashed down under the water and circled each other near my calves before dipping their faces up into the air again.\nAgain, I said, \u201cBut how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d they both said.\nI looked at one, and then the other. \u201cDo you always talk in unison like that?\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d said the left manatee.\n\u201cNot always,\u201d said the right manatee.\nThey circled each other a couple more times and then turned their backs to me, speaking only to each other in a language that sounded like Portuguese. \u201cHello?\u201d I said. The manatee on the left (I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the same one as before) turned its head to look back at me, but it didn\u2019t say anything.\nI waited. They swam around each other again and then pressed their bodies together between my ankles, flapping their flippers around.\nMaybe they needed time to make their predictions, to gaze into whatever the manatee equivalent of a crystal ball was. I leaned my head back against the edge of the bathtub and stared up at the ceiling. Just as I was beginning to space out, the manatees spoke in unison again. \u201cWe\u2019re hungry,\u201d they said.\n\u201cWhat do you guys eat?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re sleepy. We want candy.\u201d They began to cry like human babies.\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I sat up, put an awkward hand on each of their heads. They quieted down some. Their skin was cool and smooth.\n\u201cRead us a story,\u201d they said.\n\u201cI\u2019d have to get out of the bath to get a book,\u201d I told them.\n\u201cNo!\u201d they cried, splashing around in frantic figure eights. \u201cDon\u2019t leave us!\u201d\n\u201cOK, OK.\u201d\nThey stared at me, waiting.\n\u201cI guess I could make up a story,\u201d I said.\nThey both nodded emphatically.\nI leaned back, and each manatee put its head on one of my knees. \u201cOK,\u201d I said. \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a small village deep in the woods. One day, she was out picking berries when she came across an old witch standing right in her path.\u201d\nThe manatees were rapt.\n\u201cAt first, the little girl was scared, but then the witch smiled and said, \u2018Hello, my pretty. You remind me of myself when I was small. I will grant you one wish. Shall you wish for a handsome prince to love you forever?\u2019 But the girl said, \u2018No.\u2019 And the witch said, \u2018Shall you wish for great riches and a grand castle to live in?\u2019 But again, the girl said, \u2018No.\u2019 And the witch said, \u2018Shall you wish for eternal youth, to be the most beautiful girl in all the land?\u2019 But the girl just shook her head. So finally, the witch said, \u2018Then what shall you wish for?\u2019\u201d\nI paused. The manatees were frozen with attention.\n\u201c\u2018I shall wish for knowledge and understanding,\u2019 said the girl, and the witch nodded slowly. \u2018I see,\u2019 she said. \u2018That is a most powerful wish. I will grant it to you, but for a wish that powerful, there is something you must do in return. You must burn down your home. You must burn down your village. You must burn down all of these woods and walk away, never to return again.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d breathed one of the manatees.\n\u201cAnd so the girl burned down her home, and her village, and the woods, and she walked away, never to return again, and she became the wisest and most powerful girl in the land.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d whispered the other manatee.\n\u201cThe end,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d they asked together.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s intense,\u201d they said.\n\u201cI know.\u201d I looked down at my fingers, which were thoroughly pruney by now. The manatees looked at my fingertips too, and then down at their own smooth flippers. When were they going to give me my fortune? Maybe I was using the wrong tactic. Maybe I needed to ask rather than wait to be told. \u201cSo,\u201d I said.\nThey turned to stare at me again with eyes like tiny black caves. Their noses twitched at the ends of their whiskered snouts.\n\u201cSo,\u201d I repeated. \u201cIs there anything I should know? You know, about the future?\u201d\nThey turned away and chattered to each other in Portuguese again and, before I could react, dived down under the water and swam toward the drain.\n\u201cWait!\u201d I cried. I leaned forward and tried to cover it with my hands, but the manatees zoomed around and slipped under my fingers, resulting in my accidentally pulling up the stopper. They didn\u2019t come back up, but the manatee now on the right turned and waved at me before they both disappeared through the drain, chased by the tiny tornado of emptying bathwater.\nI sat in the tub, wet and cold, until all the water was gone. That was it? That was the great life advice I was supposed to get, the personalized guidance for my future? Shivering, I hoisted myself out of the bathtub and wrapped my towel tight around me. I put on my pajamas but didn\u2019t bother to tuck a sugar cube under my pillow before going to bed. For a long while, I stared into the depths of the unknowable night, and then I fell into an all-consuming sleep.\n* * *\nThe next day, I wandered through the hallways of school, distracted through each of my classes. What had it all meant? Had I missed something? I went over every detail of the visit, repeating every one of the manatees\u2019 words and gestures until the whole thing started to blur, but I still couldn\u2019t make sense of it. Was my visit abnormal, or was I perhaps defective in some way? What was I going to tell my friends?\nI saw Julie, Sylvia, and Alicia at lunch, but didn\u2019t say anything about my visitors until the four of us were seated together with our sandwiches. I was unsure what to say, but I couldn\u2019t resist letting them know that it had finally happened. \u201cThe manatees came last night,\u201d I whispered, and they all beamed and leaned in to hear about my prophesy.\nI looked around at each of them. It wasn\u2019t until that moment that I noticed it: the look on their faces, that same hunger, frustration, and uncertainty I had felt each time one of them told her own story. They didn\u2019t know what any of it meant, either. This was the secret they had all been keeping, and not just from me. From each other, even from themselves. All of them must have known that you had to make up your own story, but nobody wanted to admit it. As soon as I saw it, the words poured forth like a river in springtime. \u201cThey said I would have great power after a while,\u201d I told them. \u201cThat I would be in control of important things.\u201d My friends grinned, delighted, demanding as many details as I could give them and scouring my face for clues as to what it all meant.\nA few months later, when it was time to leave for college, I boarded an airplane by myself, headed to a distant place far from the one I had always known. As I soared over bodies of water and the first trees turning to flame under the early breath of autumn, I smiled, and let a faraway look come across my face.\nHeather Kamins is the author of a poetry chapbook, Blueshifting (Upper Rubber Boot Books, 2011).

Her tarnished wings stutter in the salt air, their metal quivering under the tram\u2019s weight. Before I can draw the brake to ease her burden, another metallic feather pops free. It tumbles to the ocean below, swallowed by a wave. Phix has lost four primary feathers in the past three days.\n\u201cMos . . . wen.\u201d\nMy name breaks in the sphinx\u2019s dry mouth. I reach a hand through the tram\u2019s ceiling hatch to press fingers against her furred paw. \u201cRest.\u201d\nThe tram groans against the line with Phix\u2019s exhale, rocks gently, then ceases. We rest between stations, above the debris of the main switch house, though beyond the strand where the tramlines split\u2014sunward toward damaged tracks and flooded islands, oceanward where our own tracks curve toward the cove where we sometimes see lesser whales. Warm sunlight beats down from the cloudless sky, turning my Phix gold under her dark sea tarnish. She is twice my own length in size, yet half the size of the tram; she hauls us both without complaint, strong even though she is failing.\nThere are no feathers in the tram. I have looked but find myself looking again as though I have not looked upon this interior for two years. I have walked from rusting stem to rusting stern, have swept every curved corner clean, and there are no feathers. I know we will have to search the river delta where debris clutters and even the idea is like a fist against my heart.\nWe pass it every five days\u2014will reach it again in another two\u2014and every time my dismay is fresh. The delta is filled with the evidence of other people, yet I have never seen another soul there. Phix says there are no others now, only their debris. There should be others. This tram was not meant to carry me alone; my grandfather ran the lines when the trams were full, the lines electrified. In the early days, Phix and I pretended there were people to ferry about, waiting around the next curve of island.\n\u201cMoswen. Ready.\u201d\nPhix stretches her wings against the clear sky, a great span that shades us from the sun\u2019s warmth. I tense, expecting more feathers to loosen, but they hold and I ease my grip on the brake. Those wings stroke once more, moving us down the line. I don\u2019t think I will ever grow tired of watching those wings move, even when their perfect moments are few and far between.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll rest at the cove,\u201d I tell her, and her reply is a terse chirrup. I know she wants to go farther, wants to prove herself and find others of her kind despite the cost to her wings.\n\u201cWhales.\u201d\nPhix announces them just as I notice the dark shapes in the ocean. Not lesser whales; these are larger, like dark stones gliding slow and sure toward Down Point. Warmer water is said to pool there and I wonder if it means we\u2019re in for a change of weather. I make a note in my log: six whales, Down Point, mid-morning; submerged stones.\nThe whales surface every now and then, spewing. I watch them blow air into air because it\u2019s easier than watching Phix struggle with the tram and wondering when another feather will drop free. These days, our world is eleven stations long, connected by the ancient elevated lines that loop the boundary of the island we call Selk. I may need to remove more tram seats from this rusting carriage before Phix can make another circuit safely.\nA spark on the track ahead steals my attention from the whales, from thoughts of losing Phix. My hand rests on the brake and Phix exhales as her burden is eased, wings slowing. Out the front window, the spark makes itself known through the mirage heat spiraling up from the track.\nMy fingers brush the knife at my side, then I set the brake to stop the tram at the turnout to the cove stationhouse. I climb up through the tram\u2019s hatch and perch beside Phix, who leans a strong shoulder into me. She is sun-warm metal, sweat-slicked fur, and hard breath. She chirrups again, happy or questioning, and her thin tail lashes. She sees what I see. At the turnout there sits a box latched with metal.\nI pull myself onto the girders and walk the narrow foot track along the tramline as if I am on a high wire above a crowd. As far ahead as I can see, the line is as empty as it has been for two years, but here sits a box. A box that was not here when last we passed.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asks me.\nThere is no good answer. \u201cA box?\u201d I ask in return. Her snort of irritation carries to me as I crouch before the box. The metal that latches it is smooth.\nThe box is small and not heavy. I carry it back to the tram, where Phix and I stare at it as though it might open on its own, but it only looks back at us, silent and metal and inanimate. My own face looks back at me, brown and round and swallowed by Phix\u2019s own when she leans in closer. Her eyes are vast within the metal, stretched into winglike forms.\n\u201cI had a mirror once,\u201d she says, and before she can say more about the world that was, I grab the box and drop through the hatch, into the tramcar. \u201cMoswen\u2014\u201d\nI ease up on the brake and the tram glides slow on the line. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the cove station\u201d is all I say. She knows I don\u2019t like to talk about the world that was, the world that is gone yet lingers in pieces all around us.\nPhix\u2019s wings beat the air without further complaint and we move.\n* * *\nGrandfather died last winter; we couldn\u2019t drop his body into the ocean as he wished because the hard-blowing storms would have only pushed his body inland. Phix and I spent most of that season in the river delta stationhouse after burying Grandfather in the cold mud of the riverbank. The tram stayed frozen to the lines in layers of ice, forcing us to leave the tramlines ahead untended. When thaw came, we were exhausted by the work that needed doing at every stationhouse and to the tram.\nThe lines had been Grandfather\u2019s to tend before me, before even the flood. My parents hadn\u2019t shown an interest in them; they were people of the land and wished to live where they couldn\u2019t see the incessant ocean, but even they hadn\u2019t been spared its hungry flood. The waves had taken everyone\u2014had nearly taken even us, rising so high as to soak the trams.\nPhix was older than me, her kind long-lived. She could remember two floods before the one that had carried my people away, could remember the bounty of fishes that washed into the trees for her to eat. She had not seen the ground for days, waking to find her next wriggling meal cupped within her metal wings.\nWe thought we were the last, but now the box. It sits near the handbrake, a small denial of everything we believed. Shadows course over the metal as Phix and I guide the tram into the station, making the box seem less real, though it doesn\u2019t dissolve under my touch.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d\nI look up at Phix\u2019s question. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\nShe peers down through the hatch at me, eyes narrowed. \u201cSimple solution.\u201d\nWith a grunt, I look back at the box. I can remember other boxes from the world that was, tied with long grasses and given as gifts. This box was a gift of sorts, too, but opening it opens us to the possibilities we have denied ourselves for so long. With hesitant fingers, I ease the latch out of its groove and push up on the lid. The scent of tree sap rolls out to greet me.\nInside rests a small piece of paper, used for a long-ago list. Those words are nearly smudged away, while others have been made on top of them in gleaming black seeds. These seeds stick to the page with sap.\nI pull the page out and close the box. These seed words did not form themselves, and I am shaking when I haul myself through the hatch to sit beside Phix. I show Phix the page and she draws a sharp breath.\nShe reads the words aloud and it gives them a new power. \u201cI am yet alive.\u201d\nOn the page in black seeds they were one thing. Given voice, they were another. I want to set the page down because my hand is shaking but don\u2019t want the paper to blow off the tram and into the ocean.\nPhix sets her blue stare on me. \u201cWho is alive? What does that mean? There is someone else in this world?\u201d\nShe looks around as though we could be tormented by this new person at any moment. But the stationhouse stands quiet, but for the birds fussing in a rafters-high nest.\n\u201cPerson\u2019s got food aplenty, if they\u2019re making letters with seeds,\u201d Phix says.\nI touch the seeds again, tracing the A in the word alive. If the person didn\u2019t have food aplenty, they had sacrificed a good deal to leave the message. To let me\u2014to let someone\u2014know they were out there. But where?\n\u201cAnother working tram?\u201d Phix\u2019s eyes go to the tracks beyond the stationhouse.\nThe idea seemed impossible. Most of the trams fell into the ocean when the waves came. We had found two others on the lines, but they had been in such bad condition, we had spent weeks pushing them onto adjacent lines where emergency trams once waited. They sat there even now. Had someone repaired one? Phix and I passed them every five days and we had seen no one. Hiding only to reveal oneself later didn\u2019t hold much logic for me.\n\u201cMoswen.\u201d\nPhix sobs then, furred body shaking. She tries to fold a wing to her face, but I wipe her cheeks dry before she can. Afraid? Afraid that this person would take what little we had managed to create this past year? We had food stored in stationhouses along the route, supplies we had salvaged, countless things another person might want. This is where my mind turns. But Phix\u2014\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s another me.\u201d She squeezes her eyes shut and it seems loneliness that leaks from her, not tears.\n* * *\nThere were no feathers in the cove stationhouse, least none that would do for Phix. Small, downy feathers scattered the floor beneath the rafter nests, and I swept them up along with bird droppings and mice bones. Amid the debris was one mouse skin, as if the animal had discarded his coat and gone for a swim. Between the floor slats I could see into the ocean, and while there were no swimming mice, two lesser whales made unhurried circles.\nI tried not to think of the seed letter as I tidied the station, but it proved impossible. I didn\u2019t want to think what it meant, because it was both terrifying and exciting to think of another person in this world. If there was another of Phix\u2019s kind, might we also find feathers to repair her wings?\nThe sphinx had not been made for hauling trams. They were made as playthings, pets for an exclusive few. It was rumored that some sphinx spent their days asking people questions that seemingly had no answers, but of course there were answers. Somewhere.\n\u201cDo you think she will be tall? Perhaps she will be strong as you are? What if she doesn\u2019t like fish?\u201d\nThe questions Phix asks have no answer that I know. I pause in my sweeping and set the broom aside to cross to the storage closet and count blankets and candles. None has been taken or disturbed since our last visit.\n\u201cMaybe she will be a he, Phix.\u201d\nThis draws a strangled sound from her and a round of new questions, ending with the idea that if there were another of her kind, perhaps it would also be male. I had never seen a male sphinx, but I do not say this to Phix, for I hadn\u2019t seen her this hopeful in months. She\u2019d last been this way as we fished a finrunner from the ocean, a treat that fed us for two days.\nWe sleep in the stationhouse instead of the tram, though sleep is a generous word, because we\u2019re both agitated. I keep waking, gazing out at the tram to make sure it\u2019s there, that no one has taken it away. Ridiculous to think, after all this time, but now we knew there was someone out there. Likely on our lines.\nAs the sun comes up, I take two extra blankets from the closet and three fat candles. If the whales are right and colder weather is on its way, I don\u2019t want us stuck without warmth and light. Blankets and candles might also be good things to trade, and this thought surprises me, for I\u2019ve never had anyone to trade with.\nIn the tramcar I set the seeded letter near the brake where I can\u2019t help but see it, weighting it with two candles. Phix peers inside, perhaps thinking the same thing I did: that it had all been a dream.\nWe don\u2019t voice any plan. I don\u2019t exactly have one beyond doing what we\u2019ve done every day since the waters rose. Travel the lines, keep them in order, look for supplies, and yes, though I have never admitted it aloud, look for people. Any people, but now the person who left the box with its letter. I picture this person tall, strong arms filled with feathers to repair my Phix. To keep us running the lines.\n* * *\nPhix loses two more feathers on the way to the river delta, one lost to the ocean, one falling through the ceiling hatch to rest near my feet. I set the feather near the seed letter, noting the way its quill tip is worn, allowing it to slide loose from the wing. We stop to allow Phix to rest three times, four times, five, and each of us hates it for a different reason. She doesn\u2019t want to appear weak; I don\u2019t want to impose this burden on her, but haven\u2019t found another way to power the tram. I would rig a sail if I could find enough lengths of untorn cloth. The unspoken question curls against my heart: would Phix leave me if she could properly fly?\nIt is dark when we angle the tram onto the turnout for the river delta stationhouse. The old building rises black against pale, half-toppled trees clinging to the muddy ground. I know the water that licks the stationhouse pilings is brown from silt, blacker inland along the banks where mud and oil have mixed. In the moon\u2019s faint light, oil gleams across the water, keeping whales and fish out. Upriver where the sand rises in a craggy bar, one might find snakes, but all else has gone, leaving the wreckage to collect where the river tongues the sea.\nPhix rests as I brake the tram inside the stationhouse. We would like this stationhouse best, with its inside track and whole roof, but for the debris that flows beneath the building, a constant reminder of the world that was. Sometimes we find bodies, or the memory of bodies, for what bob to the surface are not \u201cpeople\u201d as we had known them. Bloated and pale and\u2014\nThere is movement in the dark, beyond the stationhouse and up the river near Grandfather\u2019s grave. I set the brake and climb out of the tram, faster than I have moved in weeks. My heart rests hard in my throat as I run the width of the building, to the shattered windows that overlook the upward tangle of river. A boardwalk of carved and painted wood once stood here, edged with small shops, stands of produce, artists who painted the sea. These remains tangle with the oily mud, indistinct under the moon\u2019s weak light.\n\u201cMoswen?\u201d\n\u201cThere was some\u2014\u201d\nSomething or someone? I don\u2019t finish the word. Phix drops down to crouch at my side, trembling.\n\u201cStay with the tram,\u201d I tell her. I check my knife, then head for the ruined doorway, down the stationhouse stairs slick with slime and bird droppings.\nThe movement comes again, a rustle of wings. I drop onto the boards Phix and I placed last winter when we came to bury Grandfather; they remain firm so I run. At their end, I dig bare toes into the cold mud as I climb the bank. Over waterlogged books and broken pottery. Over shoes and a rotting canvas.\nAhead in the dark comes a crackling sound and I drop to my knees, holding my breath. Trees arch above me topsy-turvy, branches interlaced like thin fingers, the spaces between ragged as mouths. There is a chirrup and for a second I think Phix has followed me, but the next sound in the dark is not her. It is a shriek I have never heard before.\nI pull my knife from its old leather sheath. All around me debris rises in hazy mounds, seeming to shift, but maybe it\u2019s just me. Maybe I\u2019m that unsteady. But amid the debris I see something I haven\u2019t seen in years, branches knitted into the shape of a nest. A nest where someone might sleep. I hook a hand into it and pull myself up to peer over the edge. The bowl of the nest is filled with treasures. A dented metal box holds a broken locket, its chain tangled; its oval face shows that of a woman within, staring at the night sky. A broken comb and a shard of mirror nestle beside the locket. I reach for the mirror, remembering Phix\u2019s mention of her own, and then a hard body bullets into mine, shoving me down into trash, into mud.\nFeathers or fur, I can\u2019t tell which in the panic, but it\u2019s not skin. My free hand closes into the body as best it can while I strike with my knife, trying to avoid the wings battering me, the hard talons in my arms. Sphinx? The knife hits home, unexpected, into the solid body, and warm blood sprays over me. The creature screams again, pinwheels back, and I hear the familiar movement of metallic wings. Sphinx! No!\nNothing coherent comes from its mouth, only shuddering sobs in the wake of injury and panic. Warm blood slicks my fingers and I push myself up, meaning to launch myself at her, catch and hold her, but she\u2019s gone, a blur against the moon and gone.\nI can\u2019t walk. My legs shake and I can\u2019t get them under me so I crawl. I know exactly how far the grave is and once there, I rake the collected debris off and kiss the stone that marks Grandfather\u2019s place. A vine tangles around my hand and I cannot pull it free for all the shaking. I lie for a long while in the mud, only trying to breathe.\nWhen I finally regain the grip on my knife, slick with mud and blood, I cut the vine. The sharp scent of lotus erupts into the night, easing the reek of trash. I\u2019m crying as I find more of the blooms; they have reached from the black river to cover Grandfather\u2019s grave.\nPhix gapes when I return. Maybe it is the lotus she stares at and not the mud and blood that cover me; she loves the flowers and we have not found any in months. She leans close and I think she means to eat one lotus whole, but it\u2019s a metallic, black feather she clasps in her teeth, tugging it from my muddy arm. The feather is as long as my arm, black bleeding into gold along its outer edge.\n\u201cBirds don\u2019t leave boxes,\u201d Phix says, and I\u2019m about to say of course they don\u2019t when she points with the feather toward the box on the far side of the stationhouse. Small and metal and latched closed. I don\u2019t bother to skim the mud off of me before moving toward the box. I leave muddy prints on the stationhouse floor, but only the small box matters. I kneel before it, finding it identical to the first box.\nI expect a letter, but there isn\u2019t one. There is a small bottle of black sand, a round white stone, and a dried squid. Phix leans closer to smell the squid in my hand. It is like any other squid we have seen\u2014we both like them crisped by fire\u2014but the other two objects are new, unknown. I give Phix the squid and she chews in silence while I tilt the vial of sand, watching the black grains shift.\nThere are no black beaches on Selk. Having circled the island for two years, I am acquainted with the colors that run from white to pink and all the pastels between. Cream, smoke, mint. The white stone is not as white as I first thought; it rolls in my palm and hidden colors reveal themselves, blue cascading into shell pink. It is perfectly round, unlike anything I know.\nUnknown, like the bird\u2014that sphinx\u2014at the river.\nI set the items down and step back from the box before skimming the mud and debris from my skin. I make a mess on the stationhouse floor but don\u2019t care. I pluck another black feather free and lay them out near the box.\nPhix shakes her head and says, \u201cNot ours,\u201d her breath redolent with squid.\nOfficially, they are ours, being that no one else is here to claim them, but I think that\u2019s not what she means. She means these things do not come from our island, from Selk. It means they come from the other islands, beyond the split lines. Sunward toward damaged tracks and unreachable islands\u2014tracks someone had fixed?\nI had not looked on our last pass through. Phix and I never stopped there because the switch point was damaged beyond our means of repair. The switch house was lost in the flood; its collapsing weight had pulled the switches and turnouts into unusable tangles. If I were honest, we likely could have set them to rights given a season or two and the proper tools, but I didn\u2019t want to. Didn\u2019t want to visit those distant islands because they meant change. Phix and I were content in our circuit, or so we told ourselves. Phix\u2019s tears and her breaking wings said otherwise even if we didn\u2019t listen.\n\u201cMoswen?\u201d\nI pocket the sand and stone and scoop the muddy feathers from the floor. I mean to keep them, but they need washing first, as do I.\nIt\u2019s hard to look at Phix as I move toward the door. Her face holds such hope that we are no longer alone. That there might be someone to share the burdens of this place. But if there was one, perhaps there were more. Perhaps they meant to take what they could of this place, make it their own.\nBut why leave the boxes?\nThat question is a sharp knife in my side as I turn to the door. The idea of someone reaching out to anyone else was less bearable then the idea that they meant to plunder our careful stores. I had never tried to reach out.\n\u201cGoing to look and wash, then we\u2019ll eat and sleep and go come morning.\u201d Running on the lines at night was dangerous; we only did it when we felt it necessary. It wasn\u2019t necessary tonight, so I told myself.\nI trawl the sodden debris on the riverbanks with my knife in hand. I think that amid all this there must be another sphinx feather or two, but if there is, I don\u2019t find them. There are fathoms of trash, pieces of lives; I cannot dig forever, even though I would for Phix. I come back to the tangled nest, to the locket and the face it holds. I tuck the memento into my pocket because some part of me refuses to leave the image of this woman alone in the waves of debris.\nWhen I come back to the stationhouse, Phix has cleaned the mud away and carried wood to the fireplace. There are racks of dried fish and seaweeds in our pantry here and we make a feast of them. Neither of us says anything about the two fish that are plainly missing from the rack.\n* * *\nI check the river again in the morning. There is no sign of the creature from last night, nor sphinx feathers. I find a basket, its reeds tightly woven, and bring it back to the tram where Phix stretches her wings as if to test the joints. I drop into the tram with a grunt, my midsection black and blue from last night\u2019s encounter, and set the basket near the brake.\nI bid Phix to go slow today, not only because I dread what we may find, but because I want to survey the lines as we go. If there is someone else on the lines, I want to be certain the lines are undamaged, that nothing worse than boxes awaits us. If someone meant mischief, it would be easily to partially split a line, to leave it ready to burst under the weight of a tram. I join Phix up top, latching myself to the jackline that circles the tram so I won\u2019t fall off.\nAll things considered, it\u2019s a smooth ride except when we move over the wheels that guide the lines around each tower point. The towers are old, rust-stained limestone pocked with barnacles near the waterline. We pay close attention to the towers on every loop we make. If one is lost, the entire tram line may buckle.\nThe salt reef blooms in the water here, stretching bony fingers around two towers. Corals consume this stationhouse, wood pulled from its supports by the growing reef. We could reach the station with our rope ladder\u2014the turnout and footpath buckled in the storms\u2014but we don\u2019t. We\u2019ve had no cause to go. There is a glint from a sliver of metal and for a moment I think it\u2019s a sphinx feather, but as we pass on, I see it is only an old piece of tram, catching the sun before clouds move over and rain mists down.\nWhen I see the body, I think I\u2019m mistaken again. It can\u2019t be a body, but is rather a curved portion of tram that has fallen atop the Stacks. These vertical columns of rock spread outward from the coast before the land swings sunward again. But this shape wasn\u2019t here on our last pass. It, like so much of late, is new and unknown.\nThe Three Sisters, the Witch, the Old Man; we have given each stack its own name. It\u2019s the Old Man that bears the body up in the gentle storm. I unhook myself from the jackline and drop into the tram to pull the brake.\nBack in the rain, Phix moves with me as I climb down the front of the tram. She leaps to the stone and a hiss escapes her. She rocks back on her haunches, tail lashing, and I see that the body is a sphinx.\nShe is not dead, but her eyes are closed to the rain. Her chest hitches, soaking-wet hair coiling dark against her neck. Her metal wings are folded along the length of her back. Where Phix is golden, this sphinx is black. I kneel beside the body and note the mark of my knife on her feathered chest. Blood gleams in rivers amid the black feathers and fur.\n\u201cSphinx?\u201d I ask.\nHer eyes shutter open and they are as golden as my Phix. I suck in a sharp breath. The eyes slide shut and my gaze lingers on the wings, considering, until Phix stamps a foot. We talk about most everything, my Phix and I, but this, like the circuit we make, seems beyond words.\nPhix doesn\u2019t have enough strength to haul the body herself, but returns to the tram. When she comes back to the rock, she has brought ropes with her. I nod and begin to bind the black sphinx. The sphinx is injured enough that she does not fight me, does not try to bite or strike out with her wings. I bind her so her wings cannot move, so she is like sail wrapped around mast. Phix and I haul her onto the tram roof. There, I unwrap her, and it is Phix\u2019s turn to stare.\nThere remains a distinct lack of words.\n* * *\nThe black sphinx sleeps fitfully but will not stop bleeding; something deep inside her has been cut. I have no medical supplies, but we cushion the sphinx with a blanket and bind another against her wound. The knife wound I made.\nWe overnight at the Stacks, the rain easing until it is only cold mist. Phix shifts with agitated energy as the other sphinx sleeps, her eyes flicking to me and then to the body between us. In the candlelight streaming up from the tram, the sphinx is a massive black shadow.\n\u201cMoswen.\u201d\nMy teeth crunch through a dried fishtail and I look at my Phix, gold and beautiful and broken. I can only imagine the thoughts that run through her head.\n\u201cShe is not well,\u201d Phix says.\nI nod my agreement and chew the fishtail to dust. \u201cMy doing.\u201d I break the dried fish apart, peeling skin from flesh, and tuck another bite into my cheek.\n\u201cAre the boxes hers?\u201d\nPhix is trying to solve the riddle we have been given. Between us, the sphinx opens her eyes, but says nothing, too weak. I break another piece of fish off and offer it to her. She lets me slide it between her lips.\n\u201cIt seems likely.\u201d I don\u2019t know what else to say, because I\u2019m also trying to solve the riddle. I look down at the form between us. \u201cSphinx, are the boxes yours?\u201d\nHer throat works as she swallows the fish. I offer her a drink from my canteen, and only after she has swallowed does she nod.\n\u201cMy mistress. Bade me. Leave them.\u201d\nA low shudder runs through Phix and seems to echo in me. The sound of another voice is completely astonishing. You live without a thing for so long, you don\u2019t notice the enormity of its lack until it suddenly returns. Our two voices had for so long seemed one. Now here is another.\nA thought rises within me, and I slide my hand into my pocket to withdraw the locket I found at the river delta. I show the oval and its faded face to the sphinx and my question is silent, but heard. The sphinx nods.\n\u201cThat. Is my mistress.\u201d\nI close my hand around the locket and wonder. Had the sphinx built herself a small nest at the delta, containing all she owned in the world, as she set about the task her mistress assigned her? And had we, in a clumsy accidental encounter, taken it all from her? Everything she had and also her life?\nQuestions rush from Phix. \u201cWhere is she? Who is she? Is she on the tramline? Will you help us find her?\u201d The hurried words remind me of the rising waters, the way they went everywhere without cease.\nThe sphinx cannot answer Phix, though. She draws a halting breath and closes her eyes again. Her blood has soaked through the blanket against her chest. Her breath comes shallow, hard.\nPhix leans over to look at the sphinx\u2019s face. I can tell my girl is holding back. She wants so much, hopes so much. I leave the strip of dried fish beside the sphinx and drop into the car to find my own rest.\n* * *\nCome morning, we move again. Phix\u2019s wings are sluggish, having spent a night in the rain and mist. The wings groan as she guides the tram away from the Stacks, toward the long line that will eventually take us to the strand where the tramlines split.\nThe black sphinx sleeps intermittently. Phix chatters whether she or I reply or not. Phix can no longer keep her speculations to herself. She is eager, a thing that translates to the way she hauls the tram; I tell her to ease up, but she doesn\u2019t. Her broken wings make hard strokes in the salt air. She is excited over the idea of finding this sphinx\u2019s mistress, of finding me my own kind as her own has been found. When Phix\u2019s left wing gives under the strain of her enthusiasm, snapping hard enough to cause an entire line of feathers to spill free, the tram shudders to a halt. Phix\u2019s sob makes me sick, and I climb to the roof where both sphinx regard me.\nI can see but one way to repair both of them, but I do not say this awful thing. There is no way to tell Phix that I could repair her wings with those the black sphinx possesses. My eyes rest on the black sphinx and she regards me, already knowing. She must know better than I; hers is the body that bleeds its life across the rusted roof of the tram, that grows weaker with each passing hour. When she nods, I nod in kind.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nPhix chirrups the word as I drop back into the tram. My hands are shaking as I take hold of my knife. I must finish what I accidentally began at the river delta. Phix sees the knife when I come back up and shrieks.\n\u201cNo. Moswen\u2014no!\u201d\nThe black sphinx tries to hush her, but Phix will not be hushed. With her broken wing, Phix is unsteady. She tries to get between me and the black sphinx, but cannot. Their bodies are so very solid, even with both of them injured, and I fear for one moment that we will all plunge from the tram. The tram rocks beneath us as I gently push Phix back, curling my hand into her feathered chest.\n\u201cShe will not survive the day, Phix. The blood will not stop.\u201d\n\u201cMos. . . .\u201d She goes slack against my hand, sobbing. Her cheek presses into my forearm, tears coiling their way into my elbow. \u201cMoswen.\u201d\nI cup her cheek as I withdraw, but only briefly. My attention is for the black sphinx now. I stroke a hand over her feverish head and her eyes meet my own.\n\u201cShe is.\u201d The black sphinx draws breath, ragged and wet. \u201cThe other islands. My mistress. Searching.\u201d\nSearching like me and Phix, and I ache at the idea of it. Phix bends her head to press her cheek against the sphinx\u2019s, and questions spill from her. Tell me everything, tell me the skies you have seen, tell me where these wings have taken you, tell me your name, your name.\n\u201cAset,\u201d she whispers, and her dying body is racked with another trembling agony.\nMy blade ends it as swiftly as I know how. Grandfather once showed me how larger beasts of the land were killed; under my blade there is a wet sigh, a jolt, and then Aset breathes no more. I fear Phix will flood us anew with her tears.\nWhen I touch Aset\u2019s wings, Phix hisses. Her tail lashes as the blood cools on my hands. That I will need two tools to remove the wings is foremost in my mind. I stare at Phix a long while, her broken wings no longer capable of folding neatly against her back. The left one cocks out, stuck. Fresh rain begins to patter on us.\n\u201cPhix.\u201d\nHer face is misery, but she nods in reply to my unasked question. I drop into the tram to get my tools, to wipe my hands as clean as I can. These tools, much like the wings I\u2019m about to take, once belonged to someone; we\u2019d found the toolbox sitting on the mint-green beach, as though someone meant to come back for it. We waited a long while. They never did.\nThe work is slow, not because of the rain but because of my shaking hands. These wings are flawless, and the joints move without protest. The metal is coated with black varnish, allowing slivers of gold to peek through.\nThe agreement to keep Phix\u2019s original wings is silent between us. I set the broken wings carefully inside the tram, then settle the new wings into place upon Phix. It\u2019s not as awkward as I feared; these wings have been made to fold so neatly, their span doesn\u2019t overwhelm. She shrugs once and the wings notch into place. I set to securing them. Once done, she stretches, wings spanning over me, over the form beside us, making a shelter from the rain.\nPhix leaps into the sky, downdraft washing over me as she flaps those glorious wings. Her cry is one of sorrowed delight, and she flies, bright against the storm, in wide loops. She climbs then plummets, a golden fireball amid the rain. It steals my breath every time.\nI brush a hand over Aset and wrap her secure in the bloodied blankets. I bind her once more in the ropes and, while Phix flies, begin the hard work of lowering Aset into the water below. The tide is going out.\n* * *\nPhix comes back to the tram when tired. She rests and the question is on my lips: does she want to be free when we reach a stationhouse with access to land? Perhaps I could make a pulley system for the tram to continue my routes, perhaps I will find enough cloth to make sail, for what is the other option? To settle somewhere and . . . live? The word is strange in my thoughts as Phix dips her head into the hatch, dripping with rain and grinning.\n\u201cMoswen. Ready.\u201d\nThe circuit is all we have and so we go, running the lines as we never have before. There is power in Phix\u2019s new wings and we sail through the sky. Phix laughs when the tram jostles over the wheels that route us around a tower and carries us out of the Stacks, toward Weather Buckle where the lines dip as close to the water as they will. The belly of the tram skims the ocean\u2014that stationhouse long since buried under the water\u2014and then we shoot up, climb easy, and for a long while we glide, the tram and Phix humming.\nThe ruins of the wheelhouse rise from the ocean as we round the island\u2019s highest point. The wheel arcs from the water right below the tramlines, weeds and nests clinging to the old wood. Usually we are greeted by squawking birds that reel into the sky and scatter, but today the wheel stands quiet. As if someone else has already frightened them away.\nA box is tied to the wheel with a length of rope. Phix slows and I set the brake, and for a long while we stare at it, then I\u2019m reaching for our rope ladder, opening the lower hatch, and climbing down. I tie the box around my waist as I climb back up.\nThis box is not like the other two. It is made of woven reeds and inside there is a ruby-red sphere, smooth skinned. It smells like a flower, and when I break it open later in the afternoon, small red seeds scatter everywhere. They are sweet and stain our mouths red.\nA fourth box greets us when we reach the point where the lines split. This box is tied to the line far past a turnout we have never taken. The metal track is dented, hammered back into position and patched with half a sphinx wing. I bristle at the sight of it, but was it any worse than reclaiming the set of wings I did for Phix? We stop the tram at the turnout, looking at the box.\nWhen I don\u2019t move toward it, Phix does. I set the tram brake and let her go, pacing uneasy circles around the tram interior.\n\u201cMoswen?\u201d\nPhix has brought the box, and I pull myself up through the hatch. This box is also woven, smaller than the other three. Inside, there is a bunch of dried squid and a rolled piece of paper. I press it flat atop the tram to discover a drawing. Black ink needles across the page to create the image of an island. But it is not Selk. It is the island that rises beyond the tramlines here, one of the islands we\u2019ve never been able to reach. Inked tramlines circle the island, with marks for stationhouses, switch points, provisions. Water, trees, wind currents. Whales marked in the water that laps the coastlines.\nPhix tongues the squid from my hand, then I drop through the hatch. I set the box with the others but keep the inked page in hand as the tram rocks under a burst of wind.\nI ease off the brake and guide the tram onto the turnout. The wind rocks us again and Phix whoops, stretching her wings into the air, hauling the tram onto these new lines where we bump and shake over the sphinx wing that holds the curve in place. The windows shudder and unknown water spreads out below us.\nThe first island hunkers low and large, spreading its black sands outward into blue waters. Small, pale squid dart in the shallows while trees I cannot name reach out from the black shores, long green fingers stretching above the water as we skim past.\nIn the distance on the track, there is another tram. It sits motionless upon the lines, seemingly empty and without a sphinx. I lift my eyes to the sky, but it too is still.\nWithin the tram, there is a slight figure, her wrinkled brown hand resting upon the tram brakes. Hers is the face within the locket, and no breath moves her chest. The old woman is dead, two boxes with metal latches sitting beside her. They are empty, but woven bins line the tram interior: notebooks, seeds, fruits, and stones; dried squid, jars of black sand. My fingers trace the lines that mottle the woman\u2019s hand.\n\u201cMoswen.\u201d Phix peers through the tram roof.\nWe will need to move the tram, I think, my mind racing ahead of my heart. Once we move the tram to the emergency lines, we can sail these tracks, learn them as we had learned those of Selk. And\u2014\n\u201cMoswen.\u201d\n\u2014and. I exhale and lift an empty box. My mistress bade me leave them. I smile at my Phix.\n\u201cWe have work to continue.\u201d\nE.

She arrives too late to stop the desperate souls running out their longboat, but in time enough to watch the water shatter it again and again on the shore.\nBent double against the wind, still, Teora tries to reach them. Though the footing goes treacherous, she struggles through the torrent, dodging the crashing swells. Even searching for survivors, she knows better than to hope. She\u2019s lived this a night a dozen times before.\nAn endless gale batters her small island, devouring more and more of the coast each day. She prays each morning, but she prays to silence. Her sore-spent offerings rot on their abandoned altars or wash away in the unceasing rain.\nAnd around the island, her people\u2019s stores grow smaller with little hope of replenishing. Hungry and sodden, they sicken. Though Teora makes endless rounds with what herbs and spells remain, she loses another child every week. She cannot blame these people for trying to escape, striking for fish, for the mainland, for the end of the storm\u2014\nEvery morning Teora prays to silence. And every day finds her here, walking the waterline, sorting shattered wood and pressing death rites to the sunken eyes of the people broken on her shore.\nBeneath the heaviest fragment of the longboat, she finds a tiny body. They lie so quiet in the muddy sand, broken and small, knots of undecided selfhood unraveling around their tiny head. Mouthing ancient prayers, Teora gropes for a pulse, whispering, \u201cPlease, please.\u201d\nHer gods remain silent. The skin beneath her fingers stays damp and gray and still.\nIt is too much\u2014another, yet another\u2014and she has no words left for loss this big.\nTeora took just two oaths, but her gods are silent.\nSalt stinging in her eyes, she staggers on down the beach, tears her hands on splintered wood. These are her people. They trust her, they look to her. She has to help them, has to find them, has to bring them home.\nHalf-blind with wind and desperation, Teora nevertheless feels the moment the Many-in-One draws close to her side. As ever anymore, the creature lingers where she walks, a quiet companion to her endless vigil. Standing bare skinned in the storm-frothed shallows, they watch her work, flat eyes glittering in the near-dark, lips pressed tight behind heavy stitch work. It is an oddly human gesture for a creature so uncertain, their watery shape shifting hive-like around the unmoving monument of their sewn-shut mouth.\nEvery day, they come and walk beside her, even as she carries bodies to their families, and it is so much like companionship\u2014so much like grief\u2014she cannot swallow it and her losses, too. Cannot weigh it against the stone of her promises and understand why\u2014\nWhy the binding? Why the vow? Why should she not greet them when they steady her against the storm?\nBut Teora stands a priest on her grandmother\u2019s path. She knows little enough of the Many-in-One, but she knows this story, now: silent gods and endless thunder, the world serpent thrashing awake in its ocean bed.\n\u201cI do not believe in the end of worlds.\u201d Voice catching in the wind, she prays now to her own determination, her familiar gods past hearing. \u201cI do not believe in the end of worlds.\u201d\nTeora took just two oaths, but she cannot translate unspeaking gods. So then, she thinks\u2014one vow broken and her desperation boiling into salt-caked resolve\u2014what does her last vow matter?\nDigging through sand and wreckage, looking for anyone who may yet survive, Teora considers her options. She must make an offering, she knows, but what? Her gods she has always fed, but what to give the un-god who cannot eat, trapped with thread that cannot break?\nShe thinks of the Many-in-One\u2019s steady presence, watching as she untangles debris from lost and precious fishing nets. She thinks of slow, humid evenings in a happier time, laughing with a dozen other women, unsnarling tangles from the line.\nHope a hard stone in her breast, Teora looks to the Many-in-One beside her, their eyes dark and sorry in her bobbing lantern light.\nShe thinks of summer, of hot blue skies and an end to this storm.\n\u201cI do not believe in the end of worlds,\u201d she whispers.\nLifting up the only body she found tonight, Teora sheds her vows and stands.\n* * *\nThough the hour seems late, with the sun forever lost behind driving rain, time means little. Teora brings the child to what remains of their family, stays long enough to wash and comb the child\u2019s hair, to speak what prayers she can to comfort them. But even here, among the grieving, her words fall on unlistening ears.\nBundled in an oil cloak, she returns to the bladed wind and shoulders across the island to the angler-maker\u2019s workshop.\nInside, wooden tables line a short stone hall, scores of oil lanterns hanging from low beams to best light their work stations. Laden shelves crowd every otherwise unoccupied space, heavy with precious glass jars, stores of needles and wire, sea-shine and silk.\nAs she expects, Teora finds the lamps at the far end still burning despite the hour, banishing every shadow from her mother\u2019s inked brown shoulders. Braids brushing the table, she peers at her project through the many magnifying crystals layered over her eyes, weaving feathers and hooks with a pair of needle-fine tweezers faster than Teora can follow.\n\u201cFigured out the ocean\u2019s moaning, then?\u201d she asks without looking up, long acquainted with the heavy tread of her younger daughter\u2019s footsteps.\nFor a moment, in the face of another loss and her mother\u2019s unshaking confidence, Teora cannot clear her throat enough to speak. It is one thing to walk the priest\u2019s path. Certainly, it had not been difficult before the storm, to listen and speak and help where she could. But this. . . .\nShe swallows, heart caught and aching, and sinks into an unoccupied workbench.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says finally. \u201cBut I know now who to ask.\u201d\nHer mother smiles. Though they have lost family of their own to the storm, though she has walked the beaches with Teora, sat vigil and closed eyes, her humor remains untouched, unassailable behind her faith.\n\u201cMe? I\u2019m flattered. Try scolding it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never worked with you, but eh\u2014perhaps.\u201d\nSomehow, Teora manages to smile back. For a moment, she is not a priest but a daughter, and she is comforted.\nShe does not believe in the end of worlds.\nShe asks, \u201cYou have tools for these things\u2014how would you pick apart a clever knot?\u201d\nSlowly, her mother sits back. She unhooks her magnifying crystals and searches Teora\u2019s eyes. After a moment, her face clears in quiet understanding. She doesn\u2019t ask if Teora is sure; priests and sailors must always be sure.\nInstead, she turns. She retrieves a little abalone box and takes from within two of the slender copper needles the angler-makers use for weaving holy lures.\n\u201cThese and patience.\u201d\nShe does not say good luck, but Teora hears it just the same.\n* * *\nNot far outside her own home, Teora feels familiar eyes fall on her again. High on the seagrass hill and unsteady in the muddy torrents, she keeps her head down, striding through. Can\u2019t chase what you want to follow. No point searching through the downpour anyway.\nAt last, Teora reaches her home. She steps inside, leaving the door wide and inviting behind her. Carefully, looking at nothing but the fire pit in the center of her room, she calls, \u201cMany-in-One, come in from the rain.\u201d\nFor a long moment, nothing happens. Teora squeezes her eyes shut\u2014hoping, hoping, heart thudding hard against the stone in her chest. And then, barely audible beneath the rain, she hears two footsteps, light and hesitant on her stone floor. The door ghosts shut. Unbreathing, her stomach churning, Teora turns.\nAs a child, before her vows, Teora felt a kinship with the Many-in-One. Confused by a body formed so differently from her sister\u2019s, she longed for the freedom of a changing shape. As an adolescent, sure of her womanhood but losing herself in the unfamiliar landscape of shifting features, Teora haunted the shoreline, hoping for something she could not name. Even lately, through her aimless ocean vigil, she struggled through the un-god\u2019s companionship with a kind of angry gratitude, resentful of her path and a compassion she could not graciously accept.\nNow, the Many-in-One stands in her threshold, barefoot and barely clothed, sealskin a loose cloak over naked flesh. They look at her, black eyes an unblinking question, and Teora feels at sea.\nShe has wanted this. She has dreaded this. She feels once again a stranger in her own skin.\nTeora swallows and steadies herself with easier tasks. Ignoring the Many-in-One for a moment, she turns her attention to lighting the lanterns that hang from her rafters, dropping a few words in each bowl to light her small home. Her resolve firmed with the shadows banished, Teora pads across the floor, back to the fire, and sits at its edge.\n\u201cI need your advice,\u201d she says.\nLaugh lines crinkle at the Many-in-One\u2019s eyes. Humor bracketing their mangled mouth, they press a finger to their lips, eyebrows raised. A question.\nTeora thinks of her vows. She thinks of the price. She thinks of her people, starving through unending storms.\nShe cannot regret her choice; it was the only one.\nShe says, \u201cI am a priest on my grandmother\u2019s path; I know your story. No blades can break your binding.\u201d Opening her hands, she lets the firelight dance on her mother\u2019s fine-worked copper. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice I\u2019m not trying to.\u201d\nA glimmer of dimple appears and vanishes as the stitches pull too taught. Moving slow, the Many-in-One crosses the room. Their eyes never leave her face, gauging even as they crouch and come to sit beside her.\nTeora pats her lap. She sees that flicker of a smile again\u2014laughing at her, perhaps\u2014and then the Many-in-One lies down. Gently, they pillow their head in her lap, sealskin falling damp and soft against the curling hair of her legs. Even through the pelt, Teora feels their heat, the tension in their frame. Hesitant, she thinks. Perhaps they are also afraid.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asks.\nA hand finds her ankle and squeezes. The Many-in-One closes their eyes.\nTeora does not believe in the end of the world; she believes in determination, in patience, in her own steady hands.\n\u201cI will go gentle,\u201d she whispers, and begins.\n* * *\nHours ache past. One by one, the many nine-fold knots unravel, tearing the skin of old scars however carefully she tugs them free.\n\u201cI have an ointment for pain,\u201d she murmurs, well toward dawn, but the Many-in-One\u2019s hand tightens on her ankle and she remains.\nDaubing blood away with her fingers, Teora works on. She thinks of little but the next twist, the next hurt, and so when the final knot falls away, Teora moves to the following before realizing there isn\u2019t one.\nA swimmer to an unfamiliar shore, she returns to herself, the kinked and flesh-stained cord twining heavy around her fingers. Around her, the room feels over-warm and humid, stifling with pent-up storm heat, the scent of whale oil and wet seal. And in her lap, the Many-in-One grins up at her, a seal-toothed smile unseen for a hundred years.\nTeora\u2019s breath catches. Her stomach jumps. She looks at their face\u2014open and unbound, rapidly shifting into beautiful, terrifying patterns\u2014and prays she did the right thing, unraveling a gods\u2019 trap.\nAs slowly as they came, the Many-in-One sits up. One hand curls around the back of Teora\u2019s neck, pulling her close until their foreheads press together. An ancient gesture of gratitude, she knows, but one so long fallen into disuse, Teora can\u2019t remember the appropriate response.\nShe swallows. She makes a guess. Mirroring the gesture, she burrows her fingers beneath warm pelt and anchors there. Shared breath tangling between them, she counts time by her heartbeat as they remain so, that wide mouth of teeth very close to her face, praying wordless\u2014please, please\u2014an oath breaker priest to an almost god.\n\u201cThe ocean means to swallows us,\u201d she whispers against their blood-streaked lips. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d\nPulling away, the Many-in-One presses a stained kiss to the top of her head. They stand. Unbound from godly stitching, their shape shudders in the lamplight, flowing faster than she can track, changing even as she watches into something bigger, something vicious, something inhuman and beautiful and mad. Slow as shallows, they lift the pelt from their bare shoulders and lean close, tucking it around her.\nTeora can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t tear her gaze away from their eyes\u2014no longer flat, but an entire night sky\u2014questions and prayers a flood against her tongue. Words clot in her throat. Gulls fill up her lungs.\nReed-hollow, she whispers, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\nThe Many-in-One smiles.\n\u201cSwim.\u201d\n* * *\nThe sun rises, insofar as it still does. Outside the heavy sand-bar glass of her one windowpane, the quality of the storm changes, living shadows writhing in the onslaught rather than complete, unsteady black. Sitting alone at the embers of her fire, Teora notices only a settling damp, her bare feet gritty with sand.\nHer vows are broken. The storm rages on.\nShe stares at her hands, at the tangled handful of cording, and the seal pelt heavy on her legs.\nThe Many-in-One must not need it any longer, their true shape finally free.\nTeora closes her eyes. Her stomach clenches, sick with dread and anticipation, with an ineffective anger and helpless pain. What will happen now? There will be a price to pay, she knows. All magic takes its toll. And she does not regret her choice, no, but Teora cannot help wondering what will happen to a gods\u2019 mouth unstitching the mouth of an almost god? What will happen to her people, trapped within an unending storm?\nShe wonders what has already happened, the sea-stone idols of her gods all dead-eyed and silent on their shrines.\nAt the sound of her door inching open, barely moving despite the howling wind of the storm, Teora looks up. She finds her sister peering through the gap, hunter-eyed and crouching, her spear ready in her hand. Seeing her alone, Kura straightens. She slips inside.\n\u201cIn case,\u201d she says to the question in Teora\u2019s eyes, propping her spear against the doorframe. \u201cOnly in case. Mother told me you took a certain guest. I thought they might be hungry after so long stitched shut.\u201d\nTeora swallows, scoured raw. She hears her sister walk across the room, but cannot bring herself to rise, to greet her properly, to offer food.\n\u201cThey did not ask to eat,\u201d she says instead. \u201cMust not need to.\u201d\n\u201cDid they answer you, though?\u201d\nTeora stares at the skin spread over her knees, the coil of thread a hot wire in the palm of her hand. Slowly, she lifts her arm\u2014her burden weighs a shrine\u2019s worth\u2014and lets it fall onto the floor.\nBehind her, her sister goes very still.\n\u201cTeora,\u201d she breathes. But though Teora broke her oaths, though she unraveled a gods\u2019 trap and hailed the Many-in-One as a friend, Kura only loops her arms around her shoulders and holds fast.\nShe asks, \u201cWhat did they tell you?\u201d\n\u201cTo swim.\u201d\nKura pulls away, her face folded in concentration. After a moment, she crosses the room, somewhere behind her and out of sight. Teora hears her rifling through chest and drawers, but cannot bring herself to look. The stone of hope she has carried so long in her chest rattles loose and rises, its shattered halves choking her.\nHer vows are broken. The storm rages on. All for a seal pelt and string.\nHer people trusted her in vain.\nShe failed, she thinks. She failed.\nBut after a moment, Kura returns to her side. She picks up the gods\u2019 thread as though it weighs nothing\u2014perhaps to her it does\u2014and threads it through a long bone needle of their grandmother\u2019s.\nWatching her, Teora feels a frisson through her blood, burning away the fear and crushing loss. Her vision narrows, seizing on the needle and thread. For a moment\u2014a sudden, searing glimpse\u2014she feels the path that future walks stretching beneath her feet.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cOh.\u201d\nAnd thinking of tangled fishing nets, water-breaks weighted with scales and seaweed, Teora looks at her bright-eyed sister and dares to hope again.\n* * *\nRain lashing at her face, Teora fights her way down to the shore and into the seal\u2019s skin. She carries her gods\u2019 thread coiled in her mouth, her grandmother\u2019s needle caught between her teeth. Though the waves claw trenches in the sand, she forces her way through these, too, cutting an unfamiliar body deep into the sea.\nBelow the storm, the water hardly gentles. Heavy and cold, it batters at her bones, shoving her off course, but Teora is used to moving in a body that feels strange to her\u2014this is just one more. She presses her head down, dives deep and swims deeper, into the bitter gray.\nAt the ocean\u2019s bed, she finds a floor chucked with coral and rocks and broken pottery. Longboat shards jut between the remnants of ancient, sea-swallowed shrines. Here and there, she recognizes the faces of her gods, their smiles worn to flat nothing by the constant tide. They do not watch her pass; there is nothing left inside.\nTeora swims. And past the wreckages, past the residue of gods, she sees it\u2014\nIn her bones, she knows, this is the place the world serpent slept. She can feel the memory of its scales against the sand, can taste the chalky scent of its shed skins and the copper of its long dreaming.\nBut its bed lays destroyed, abandoned\u2014only a rip in the fabric of the world, water undulating through a sore and pulsing gap.\nTeora has no words for this. Fear catches her, ancient and far larger than herself, larger than the whole of the universe pressing down. She knows what this means: when the gods go silent and the world serpent wakes, the endless storm and broken ships, the Many-in-One waiting in the shadows for their part in this.\nTeora knows the stories\u2014she walks as a priest in her grandmother\u2019s path\u2014but she will not believe in the end of worlds.\nTeeth clenched, her heart hard, Teora drives herself deep. She presses her grandmother\u2019s needle into the world. Weaving the tiny, nine-fold knots she learned unravelling a gods\u2019 trap, she sews the ocean, binding wave to earth\u2014\nAnd she can see how it might be done. She can see the warp and weft of magic around her. She can see the torn places where the waves rise high. She can see it\u2014\nBut she cannot mend the gap with only a mouthful of thread. The ocean thunders free from her every stitch, rending further in the places where her needle passed. Far above her, the storm roars on. The break strains around her, screaming, wrenching, tattered ends fluttering in the wild current.\nTeora dives, forcing her needle in, desperate to stop it worsening\u2014\nAnd the world breaks.\n* * *\nShe surfaces, body aching and battered, to a vast and endless ocean sprawled out in all directions. Stars melt into the waves until everything is stars, everything is waves. Fathomless, the whole of possibility sprawls around her. Oddly, she is not afraid.\nTeora sees something moving in the massiveness\u2014an incomprehensible shape, beautiful and horrifying. She hears many voices speaking. She hears only one.\nThey whisper, \u201cSwim.\u201d\nTeora fills her lungs with air, lowers her head to dive\u2014\nAnd the world breaks.\n* * *\nShe surfaces, to a calmer shore beneath a bluer sky. The ocean sprawls glass-still for miles, not a ripple, not a current. Teora sees her sister and mother waiting for her on the beach, alongside many of the island. They laugh, holding each other, blind with tears and unsteady joy. Someone sings and the song carries, praising the end of the storm.\nAround her, like soap bubbles, uncountable fish rise to break the crystalline surface. Bloated and rotting, they coat the dead water in a reeking blanket, scales flaking into slime and dust. Voice by voice, on the island, a hush falls.\nTeora flounders toward the shore, struggling to keep her head above the fetid water. She tries to call to her family, but her voice barks and breaks, senseless.\nAs one, the fish around her turn. Though bulging with gas, their eyes a soupy morass, each fish peers at her, focused on the unfamiliar territory of her seal-furred face.\nIn many voices, in one voice, they whisper, \u201cSwim.\u201d\nTeora fills her lungs, lowers her head\u2014\nAnd the world breaks.\n* * *\nShe surfaces to a raging storm, the waves rushing faster, battering against the island. Houses tumble into the waves, one after another, debris-choked sea swallowing their homes. Teora screams in her shattered seal voice, bellowing desperate panic, howling prayers with no gods left to listen\u2014\nAnd hears through the storm her howl repeated.\nSlick, dark heads break the waves, ungainly seals fighting through the current toward her. Teora calls and calls again. She calls until her voice breaks on salt and hope, until her family and her people bob around her, barking questions and comfort in unfamiliar voices made sensible again.\nCutting through the crashing waves, Teora herds everyone close. She buoys pups where she can, nudging those that struggle up for air. She forms an island of furry bodies among the crashing storm, even as their own familiar island sinks into the sea.\nAs she works, she can see a fat, bright behemoth cutting through the floating wreckage, vast and glittering, scaled pelt painted in sunrise and darkness. They shift and double, one creature moving in multitudes, swimming somewhere between the endless sky, the blue sky, the stormed sky. . . .\nThey glance back at her, black eyes glittering, beckoning, \u201cSwim.\u201d\nThe gods bound their mouth for a reason, but all the gods are dead.\nTeora looks around at her people, a sea of sparks burning in a changing ocean. She doesn\u2019t know where they are going\u2014does not know where eventually they\u2019ll end\u2014but they are already cast among the stars.\nShe has made her choice, an oath breaker priest to an almost god.\nTeora fills her lungs, lowers her head.\nAnd gathering her home around her, together, they swim.\nCrystal Lynn Hilbert lives in the forgotten backwaters of Western Pennsylvania and subsists mostly on old trade paperbacks and tea.

Big game bursting through the seams of a cheap suit. He comes chargin\u2019 into the barroom, nostrils flaring, teeth gnashing. His antlers scrape the ceiling. He lights a smoke with your lighter and forgets to give it back. He takes a mouthful of peanuts and knocks the bowl to the floor. Smash. Drunk. Eyes yellow. Mouth foaming. You tell him to get lost but he just dances in the broken porcelain and sings a surly rhyme about your mother.\nSpittle falls from his face and it\u2019s on to the next table till he finds the folks he\u2019s looking for. They\u2019re in the back, by the pool table, and they\u2019re not looking for the Hind tonight, but they\u2019re not doing an especially good job of avoiding him either. The Hind sits down in the shadows and switches to tequila \u2019cause it\u2019s within reach. Sometimes he just goes on sitting in the shadows all night, puffing on tobacco and not bothering a soul. Other nights a hoof comes down on a shot glass like a piston, reducing it to sand under a thousand pounds of venison. It sounds like gunfire. Like a starter\u2019s pistol. Bang! Nico\u2019s head rockets up from the table, a napkin stuck to his forehead by sweat. Sobriety. Clarity, momentarily. And hunger. His guts scream. He peels the napkin from his forehead; someone scrawled a cock on the thing and the mirror image is stuck to his face like a temporary tattoo. Tom\u2019s teaching a Korean girl to play pool in his broken, boozy, half-practiced Korean and his stilted, staccato, half-shouted English. She doesn\u2019t understand him but it doesn\u2019t matter \u2019cause she already knows how to play. The Hind whispers into Nico\u2019s ear about fried foods. Fatty foods. Foods that tighten the belt and quicken the heart. He starts shouting their names aloud like he\u2019s calling roll at the Old Country Buffet. Waffles! Donuts! Pizza . . . I said pizza, damn it!\nIt\u2019s Darry\u2019s shot but he\u2019s busy giving a gassy speech about the Beatles. They\u2019re the fookin best. We know. Name a better fookin band. We can\u2019t. Go on then, do it. We said we can\u2019t. And don\u2019t say \u2018The Stones.\u2019 We weren\u2019t going to. I mean I like the Stones, but they just don\u2019t compare. Know what I fookin mean? They do, but Darry goes on acting like they don\u2019t until he remembers that he\u2019s hungry. Did someone say pizza? I\u2019d fancy a pizza. Nico, pizza? Mate, is that a penis?\nThe Hind snorts and spits and he\u2019s pushing the boys into the street with his pointed crown. Tom follows them out, seething and alone. He bought the lady three cheap drinks, but cheap drinks only impress cheap ladies and she wasn\u2019t his type, apparently. Liam starts kicking a can down the street and saying that he\u2019s some famous footballer before Darry punts the can away. No, you\u2019re just a fookin wanker! Charlie and Nico talk about movies while Darry and Liam discuss soccer and Tom hates life while he sucks down a cigarette. An old lady with the curved posture of an apostrophe sells them mini pizzas in Dixie Cups and the fake cheese is still bubbling when the Hind shoves the things at their mouths. Tongues burn, enamels run and hide. The boys wash it all down with rice beer that\u2019s colder than it is good, and it\u2019s not especially cold. Crush. Slam. Spark. The Hind lights up Tom\u2019s cigarette. This is boring. I\u2019m fucking bored. The Hind\u2019s words fall from Tom\u2019s mouth with a cloud of smoke. Charlie and Nico go prattling on about movies black and white. Slow and long. Strange and foreign. Darry\u2019s buying another pie. These fookin things are fookin lovely. The Hind sets his sights on Liam, or Tom does. Liam is drunk. Liam is malleable. Liam, you know you want to go to the club. Liam lifts a cigarette of his own and the Hind has a match lit before the butt hits Liam\u2019s lips. I ain\u2019t going to the club, mate. Not again. Tom looks to Darry for support but he\u2019s halfway back to the old lady and her cart of scalding pizza cups for round three.\nLet\u2019s do it! Charlie can barely stand, but he wants to dance. Let\u2019s do it, let\u2019s go. Liam points his smoke at Charlie\u2019s chin. They\u2019ll never let you in, mate. You\u2019ve got cheese on your face. Still got a dick on yours, Nico. Nico licks his thumb and tries to rub the dick from his head. Charlie doesn\u2019t touch the cheese; he just stares at Liam with charcoal eyes, black as the Hind\u2019s. I\u2019m not a\u2014fucking. . . . You\u2019re a fucking cheese face! Liam takes a drag from his cigarette. I\u2019m a what, mate? Darry stumbles back with his pizza. What are we fookin doing, Tom?\nWe\u2019re going to the club!\nOh, I\u2019m not drunk enough to go to the fookin club. . . .\nThen we\u2019re going to get good and drunk first!\nCharlie stares at Liam like he\u2019s lunch. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re on about, mate. It\u2019s just a bit of cheese. And at the mention of cheese, Charlie snaps. He drops his beer and before it hits the ground he\u2019s tackling Liam to the street. Liam tells him to stop but he\u2019s not talking to Charlie anymore. He tells him to stop again and the Hind\u2019s black eyes stare back, saying, Make me. A few of Charlie\u2019s wayward fists graze off Liam\u2019s shoulders before Darry pulls him away. Tom and Nico howl with laughter and Liam is outraged until Charlie buys a beer and makes amends. All is forgotten and the Hind bounds down the street with his hooves click-clackin\u2019 against the asphalt and the boys on his back, a-whoopin\u2019 and a-hollerin\u2019. Every whim, the Hind indulges. When Tom and Liam want cigs, the Hind buys \u2019em a carton and they toss them to strangers like a drunken parade. When Nico wants a can of beer, the Hind talks him into a glass bottle \u2019cause they\u2019re more fun to smash. Nico counts coins with one eye shut while Darry tells the terrified clerk that she\u2019s beautiful and Charlie vomits into the recycling bin. The Hind waits watching in the street, under the neon lights, and when he gets restless he taps a hoof against the glass and wordlessly beckons the boys back out into the street. Smash!\nNico drops or throws his bottle and the boys stumble into the club. Rollicking drunk. Darry\u2019s mumbling nonsense and won\u2019t stop sneezing. Arrreeght [achoo!] bahys eez toimfur fookin [achoo!] deshco, yee fookin fooks! Liam nods knowingly and Tom follows the two Englishmen onto the dance floor while Nico and Charlie take to the bar for a shot of whiskey. Two shots. Three. The Hind gives Charlie words for a cute girl in suicide heels. The Hind buys Nico another whiskey, and not a moment later Charlie is rubbing the sting from his cheek and Nico is wiping the vomit from his shoes. By the time they find the dance floor Tom and the Englishmen have their shirts off and are dancing like lunatics. Like a psych ward on club drugs. Madness. Limbs flail. Feet stomp. Fists fly and ten feet in every direction separates them from the angry, confused locals. They are drunk. They are repellent. They are dancing very dangerously, a man says to Nico with a mix of concern and disgust. Charlie throws his shirt to the masses and swings his briefcase around his waist like it\u2019s a hula hoop. It\u2019s okay, says Nico before he strips off his own shirt. They\u2019re my friends!\nSkid. Scrape. Palms bleed. Heads throb. The boys are thrown into the street, shirtless. The Hind laughs and it sounds like wind howling through a chimney. He strikes up a match and lights everyone\u2019s smokes. Charlie finds a bottle of soju in his briefcase. Twist. Snap. Swig. Charlie turns the bottle upside down and tucks it into the back of Liam\u2019s pants like a pistol. The liquor pours down Liam\u2019s backside and he tries to run away but the bottle goes with him, of course. He\u2019s soaked. Furious. Red with rage. Tom\u2019s smoke falls from his lips as his hysterical laughs turn to choking coughs.\nCharlie runs. Liam chases. Charlie jumps a fence, climbs a roof. Liam climbs the fence, falls to the other side and scrambles up the wall but Charlie\u2019s already a mile away, sprinting down the apex of the sloping roof like a trapeze artist. Liam pulls himself onto the roof and takes off running. Long strides. Heavy feet. Heaving breaths. He\u2019s actually making up the distance when his foot comes down on a loose tile and sends it rocketing from the roof. It flies through the air like a clay pigeon and Liam goes upside down, toppling to the edge of the roof, taking more tiles with him. He claws desperately for a hold but only rips another tile loose as he rolls over the edge. He lands hard in a small garden enclosure and a tiny dog comes slobbering from the sliding door. Nico, Darry, and Tom peek over the fence to see Liam lying in a flower patch, shirtless, bloodied, soaking with soju and playing with a puppy. He looks up at the boys while the dog licks his nose and a smile spreads across his face. Mates, this dog is really friendly! The dog\u2019s owner isn\u2019t, however. Not at five a.m. with a soggy Englishman lying in her garden. She shouts something in Korean that doesn\u2019t need translating and the boys help Liam over the fence.\nThey\u2019re walking away when Nico turns back and sees the thing on the roof. Its twisting, gnarled antlers stretch to the sky. Nico squints. The red tie is loose around its neck and its shirt is stained under a threadbare suit jacket. It bangs a hoof against the roof like a jackhammer, smashing shingles, and Nico swears the damn thing is applauding. He\u2019s never seen the beast before, but he knows it instantly and the words come to his lips as naturally as a curse after a stubbed toe. The Hind. He accepts them like a toddler learning to put words to his world. A tree is a tree. A dog is a dog. The Hind is the Hind.\nThe Hind. It\u2019s the Hind! he shouts. What\u2019s the Hind? a voice returns from the darkness. It\u2019s the Hind. You know, the Hind! Or does he? What is the Hind? Nico sits up. Springs creak and snap. He\u2019s in bed. Sweat drips from his nose and light spills in through cracks and gaps in the broken blinds. Morning. Light. Headache. What\u2019s the Hind, man? Charlie\u2019s air mattress squeaks as he sits up. What\u2019s the Hind? he asks again. Nico rubs his eyes and searches his mind, chasing memories as they evaporate like morning dew drawn back to the ether. What\u2019s the Hind? It was a thing. It was real just a moment ago, but now it\u2019s nothing and less. Not even a memory. I don\u2019t remember. Charlie stares squinting across the room. You\u2019re fucking nuts. He rolls over and pulls the blanket up under his chin. And you need new blinds. Nico rolls over too, but sleep won\u2019t come. The sun is blinding, the mattress is prodding. He forces his eyes closed and pretends for a while but sleep left with the Hind, or so it seems. He gets up to make breakfast. He checks his wall calendar. It\u2019s Sunday and he has nothing to do. Nico fries an egg and the smell brings Charlie to his feet, yawning and stretching. Oil spits from the frying pan while Nico drinks a liter of water like he just stumbled from a desert. Where did you get this? Nico crushes the finished bottle and sucks in some air; Charlie\u2019s eyeing the wall calendar. This month\u2019s picture is a deer on a snowy mountaintop; it was supposed to be majestic, but the deer had other ideas. Its head is turned toward the camera and its face is twisted into something like a strained smirk. Like it was trying to shit and ruin the photo. It was here when I moved in. The eggs start to burn in the frying pan but Charlie and Nico go on staring at the deer.\nIt\u2019s weird.\nYeah, I guess it is.\nDo you have any beer?\nIan Hamilton is a writer and filmmaker.

They say things like \u201cCome Back Baby, Population: Zero\u201d and \u201cI Promise Not To Do It Again, Next Exit\u201d and \u201cI Love You So Much I Can\u2019t Help Myself, Next 4 Miles.\u201d They can\u2019t tell me where I\u2019m going. Not anymore. And so they shake with the fury of my passing.\nAt the side of the road are the women on the edge of tomorrow\u2019s forecast. The first one is well out of town, a long way from anywhere. It\u2019s hard to miss a unicorn thumbing a ride, all white glow and candy twirl horn.\nThat\u2019s my danger pay on this road to anywhere, anyhow. We have each other to look after now.\nI slow down and they trot up to the passenger side.\n\u201cHow far you going?\u201d says she with a toss of her rainbow mane, other cars pinging by, stinging us with their looks.\n\u201cHow far you want to go?\u201d asks I back. And that\u2019s it, she\u2019s in.\nWithout baggage, the unicorn squeezes up front. There\u2019s plenty of space to dangle from the broken trinket chain hanging off the rearview mirror. She\u2019s comfortable so there\u2019s plenty of space for us both.\nI\u2019m not afraid of her razor hooves or horn, but I am afraid to talk for the first few miles, in case she\u2019s as unreal as my running away. No, I can\u2019t run on these feet.\nI need a presence to validate my speed limit, even if it is a pretty key chain, a rabbit\u2019s foot.\nBut she\u2019s very much not roadkill or taxidermy.\nThe unicorn finally introduces herself as Bruce, and asks if it\u2019s okay to smoke. Considering the age of our relationship and the thickness of the rollie she\u2019s holding, I tell her that maybe now is not the time. She accepts this with good grace and stashes the blunt behind her ear, tucked like one of the many bobbles in her mane.\nBruce says she likes my shoes with a lick of her lips. Despite their ache, I curl my toes deep into the purple leather. They\u2019re that shade that changes colour when the light strikes them in a certain way. Purple. Black. Bruise. Night. My pony hooves, shod with nails of delight and deceit.\nI\u2019m in like with Bruce because she takes one look at the single limp plastic bag of clothes in the back seat and only asks where, nothing else. She even gives me a bit of gas money when I stop for a fill up and hard mints (they don\u2019t melt in the glove box). The counter guy glances out the window more than once at Bruce, but he says nothing about the unicorn popping gum and playing Angry Birds on her phone in my front seat. Bless him.\nBruce saves me from awkward talk after I run out of as much truth as I can handle by pretending to sleep for a couple hours. Coulda gone by her stop and I wouldn\u2019t know. When she snortles awake, the horizon is halfway to peeling a blood orange and sucking the juice dry from the husk of day.\nThat last too much? I never was one for words, even ones that could save a life, save a face.\nI can\u2019t tell one building from the other, but Bruce decides she knows this place, and someone who could put us up for the night. I protest: I\u2019m not that kind of gal.\nI\u2019m not that kind of gal for road trips and abandoning things, but here I am.\nBruce brushes off my concern with a flip of her mane and an elvish curse, so I let her navigate me through unfamiliar territory where I would never have found an appropriate hotel. And it would have been a hotel, just not that five star type, mind. Just enough service, not too much.\nWe roll to a stop in an achingly green street, paved with the skin of leprechauns and backwash of five o\u2019clock cocktails until one sees the trees for the leaves. Bruce slams the car door and trit-trots up the front door, hoof on the doorbell for longer than necessary.\nA jet-black glossy mare with a pink mane, sparkle hooves, and a twisty horn that matches her smile answers and embraces her cousin. Bruce does the introductions and Barry lets me in without hesitation, telling me rides for hitching unicorns with stones in their hoofs are like spun gold. I compliment my passenger; Bruce didn\u2019t shit once on the upholstery.\nBarry gives my garb a once over with a lick of her lips. Dear lord, she likes the shoes too. She frowns at their colour, makes a comment about redying them.\nNo thank you.\nWe\u2019re offered icy cold beers. I\u2019ve never drunk beer before but I try not to show it. Bruce tells me I\u2019m lucky; Barry doesn\u2019t break out her homebrews for just anyone.\nThe beer numbs the pain in the ever-stiff ankles, evens things out for a while.\nI know it can\u2019t last. I\u2019m a wuss for anything much stronger.\nBruce and Barry take me to one of those underground strip clubs I\u2019ve never been able to find. Bruce informs me that it\u2019s all about knowing the right people, and I don\u2019t argue.\nThe guys up on stage are mostly elves but I don\u2019t know that until Bruce points it out. I stuff their thongs with twenty dollar bills I don\u2019t really have.\nBut what else am I going to spend my money on, other than gas, food, and lodging?\nKing of the road. Wait, no . . . Queen. Follow the yellow etc.\n* * *\nBruce and Barry wave me off the next morning with warnings about the vampires. When I look at the sun, they just laugh.\nSure enough, there are vampires hitching rides, waiting in the shade of motorway signs. A few werewolves too.\nI stop for one of the werewolves. She sinks into the passenger seat with a sigh, toothy jaw clenched tight as I shower dust on the petulant pack farewelling us with rude gestures.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d says she. \u201cThat was getting tense.\u201d\n\u2019Twas nothing, I shrug it off.\nHer name is Princess. Not Princess This or That, just Princess. \u201cYou can call me Prin,\u201d she finishes, tonguing her eyeteeth. It\u2019s hard not to look, and her smile gets bigger. Thank god she doesn\u2019t grin. I\u2019ve never liked or trusted grinners.\nPrin assures me she\u2019s not hungry, though she\u2019s taken a liking to my shoes. The red raw of my heel starts to weep, the blood pooling under the instep where she can\u2019t see.\nPrin scowls, red tongue poking out a little bit like a cat caught in the act of licking its butt. She asks what I\u2019m doing On The Road in a polyester suit with shoes like that. They\u2019re not my best shoes, I admit, but they go with everything.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replies I.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an answer as good as any,\u201d replies she.\nShe proceeds to instruct me on how to talk on the road, eliminating qualifiers and softening filters from my language, or I\u2019ll be gobbled up, snap, just like that. I do my best to scowl and swivel my ears like her. She tells me not to believe everything I\u2019m told on the road, and I believe that too.\n\u201cShould I be afraid of you?\u201d asks I over plastic bowls of salad later in the day, her shout. \u201cBeing a wolf and all.\u201d\n\u201cOnly if it suits,\u201d replies she, mesclun like green blood speared on her incisors.\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good an answer as any,\u201d replies I. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you informed.\u201d\nWe stop at viewpoints, bicker over the radio, count roadkill. Even when we skip over a town in favour of the next one well after sundown, I tell her I\u2019m having a great time.\nAnd the funny thing is I believe this too.\nHer grandmother in that next town over is just as much a riot, and welcomes me with open paws. Grandma is badass. She teaches me how to knit and bake the best red current shortcake, tweak an electric fence, load a shotgun, and troll internet forums.\nI sleep like a baby that night, once we\u2019re done with a bottle of the good Scotch whisky.\nGrandma has to teach me how to drink that, too.\n* * *\nAnd so it goes. I pick up a veritable cryptozoology along the way, my way, the high way. There\u2019s always a story, none better than the rest, other than mine.\nWe never spend more than a day and night together eating tarmac, these women and I. Some of them aren\u2019t women, but none of them are men either. They always clean up the car after themselves, a hitcher\u2019s code of conduct.\nThere\u2019s the rude griffon, who drags it out of me that there\u2019s nothing left behind, but not exactly what that nothing is. I bear the griffon with the patience I\u2019ve had drummed into me, but she doesn\u2019t last. At a pit stop she disappears into the toilets and never comes out. When I go looking for her the ladies\u2019 room is empty. I leave quickly, not wanting to test my luck.\nThe snapping tortoise doesn\u2019t live up to her name, and gives me tips on how to pick my passengers carefully. She tells me mermaids are the best for luck, but I laugh, an ugly sound, and tell her I don\u2019t believe in luck.\nThe tortoise, Shelby, eyes my plastic bag of worldly things and nods as if she wants to believe what I\u2019m saying. Leaving doesn\u2019t work like they do it in the stories, those road trips, she says. No one talks about money.\nGravity doesn\u2019t work like that, I reply. It\u2019ll be a slow crash. I\u2019ll see it coming, brake with both feet slammed to the floor, by instinct.\nA wendigo, whose name I could never get straight because they never said it or gave it the same way twice, taught me how to steal. I didn\u2019t intend to follow their lead, but before I knew it we would have left a gas station or diner without having paid.\nI wasn\u2019t happy with these sorts of lessons, but the wendigo was right about one thing: I had to be prepared in case I didn\u2019t reach the end of my journey before I was ready. \u201cRoadblocks have a habit of happening,\u201d said she.\nThe wendigo respected my hooves enough that they made no attempt at taking my shoes. Nevertheless, I slept in them. I\u2019m used to that, the throbbing pressure around my twisted little toes.\nAnd then there was the rain frog, who did little but bring precipitation upon our flight, obscuring the windows of my little car so that the rest of the world could not look or listen in. We spoke of bodies that betrayed, and I let her do all the crying. A crying frog makes it rain harder.\n* * *\nMy favourite passenger is a dragon, waiting beneath a billboard advertising moisturizer.\nShe out of all of them says nothing about my shoes. She\u2019s more interested in what\u2019s behind my eyes.\nHer name is Boh, which is short for something that would take too much candlelight and guttural spit to fully recite. And to know a dragon\u2019s full name is to know all their secrets, and no one should know all the secrets of our lizard queens.\nShe is the only one to truthfully ask my name. All my other passengers had a passing interest, but she of the green-gold scales and black-black eyes does not take my answer for an answer.\nI pick her up on the morning side of a gaudy bauble city where I had no choice but to rest amongst the ash and glitter of five shooting stars. A zombie named Renn has just finished showing me the ugly night delights and pretty gore, and at her insistence I have stolen the hotel towels. I\u2019m wrestling with this indigestion when Boh looms out of the shimmer already hinting at a fruitful day of leading the thirsty awry.\nThe dragon sits with her head askew against the roof, which lends her conversation a quizzical touch.\nBoh chews my name between her golden teeth as I suck a hard mint to dispel the previous night\u2019s rank pleasures. She takes it out twice to lick it over with her oily tongue and test it like precious mettle against her back molars.\n\u201cWhat do you do with such a thing?\u201d asks she, running a thin rivulet of flame over the name in a last-ditch effort to make it well meant. When it refuses to give up secrets I hadn\u2019t even imagined it possesses, Boh rescinds with a shrug and a sulphurous belch, swallowing it whole.\n\u201cWhatever is necessary,\u201d replies I, eyes on the painted road, stripes gaze back, eye after eye, I and I.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of creatures like you, but until now I\u2019ve never seen one.\u201d Boh isn\u2019t as delighted as one would expect. \u201cEven the unicorns have nothing on you.\u201d\nMy eyebrows knit together like one of Grandma Wolf\u2019s toothed wounds. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought I was quite human.\u201d\nBoh weaves a half-smile out of rapiers and wit. \u201cOh, there\u2019s human in you. But you\u2019re part Shadow too. Maybe on the edge of turning full Shadow. But that\u2019s the trick with them; you can never really know until the end. And even then when it\u2019s full dark, even the merest hint of light can banish the illusions. You\u2019re the proverbial cat in the box, my dear, a true Schr\u00f6dinger.\u201d\nIt mostly sounds like nonsense to me, and I tell her so.\nBoh\u2019s mouth makes a deplorable creaking sound as her smile\u2014no, not grin, thank the saints\u2014fleshes itself out. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever wondered where your shadow goes when it\u2019s not in use?\u201d She pokes one of her tines into the fleshy part of my upper left breast, ever so gently. \u201cIt\u2019s in there somewhere.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never thought about it quite like that. I\u2019ve never thought about it at all. I tell her that too.\n\u201cSee?\u201d says she. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t say \u2018I told you so.\u2019 That\u2019s just mean.\u201d\nA pressure sits at about breast height, where she poked me. Good god, is that what a laugh feels like? \u201cWhat will be helpful?\u201d\nBoh looks me over, squinting until I\u2019m out of focus. All the better to see your Shadow, my dear?\nFinally, says she: \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a threat, at least one I\u2019ve ever heard.\nHey, I thought I was in control of this car.\nBut nothing is ever neat on the road. Boh is staring at me as I play with all these decanted words heavy in my head. She nods slowly, like I\u2019m saying something. Anything.\nShe waits. Her patience almost brings a tear to my eye. I look away, but the road shimmer is empty of distraction, empty of anything but the thin line leading ahead, ever ahead, don\u2019t stop. She\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry now,\u201d says I.\nOne moment we\u2019re on a silky blacktop, the flat dry on either side, stretching empty and waiting in all directions, including up. The next, the tyres clitter and fumble into a shoulder attached to a head rattling full of trucks, a diner its single ear. I don\u2019t bother asking Boh for the story of how it lost the other. We don\u2019t have that sort of time. A neon sign sputters a tune only the insects can dance to.\nMine is the only car in a sea of eighteen-wheelers, but my sedan bears the insult well. The trucks make space, just enough and no more. There is enough shadow to worry even Boh, but she makes no mention of it, holding her scaled body straight and true. If she had been wearing a belt, she would have hooked her thumbs in it, so much did she saunter through those diner doors.\nNo one looks at the dragon, but certainly many creased and heavy stones turn on me. Ants scuttle out from under all those rocks and set my skin to itching, and I can\u2019t help fixing the collar of my shirt, doing up another button. I should have changed. Boh should have told me to change, but this isn\u2019t her story to tell.\nI decide counter stools are the safest bet, though I\u2019ve never been able to negotiate bar stools very well. I need my feet on the ground and back against the wall. The red vinyl is slippery with decades of backsides, and I squirm against their leering memory. The countertop is stabbed with pockmarks.\nThere are vampires in the darkest corner, but they know better than to stare. They leave Boh well enough alone, and I have Prin\u2019s scent on me still.\nThe lights are an aching level of lux. It bars the night from the doors. It\u2019s always night in these places, isn\u2019t it?\nThe waitress snaps gum and skates menus across the counter at us like a theme park animatronic, all big lips and cheeks rouged underneath.\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be, fellas?\u201d says she.\nI adjust my skirt, but it\u2019s already sitting too tight against my buttocks and not tight enough around my knees. \u201cTea, please,\u201d says I.\nThe waitress raises an eyebrow that only exists on the end of a blunt pencil, and someone mutters at the other end of the counter.\nBoh wants coffee.\nI want more of Boh\u2019s road stories but the light quashes the sound around us. Cutlery crashes, mucus rattles, and an old jukebox wheezes unsafe tunes, but we\u2019re allowed none of it. We must sit and wait quietly for our food to come once we\u2019ve whispered our order to the waitress, whose nametag declares her as \u2018Lil.\u2019\nRock eyes picking up no moss rest upon our shoulders. Boh says nothing. Or maybe she does, and I just can\u2019t hear her above the silence.\nThe diner fare is decent, the tea thick and hot. I look from the old TV screen chained to the wall, to the dusty blackboard specials, to the gouged lino, to the restroom doors near our end of the counter that swing far too often for my liking. It\u2019s so familiar, I could be anywhere.\nI never eat in diners. They know this.\nAnd then, eyes on the TV set to a news channel\u2014a cacophony of faces\u2014a wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washes me cold. My shoes almost fall off as they teeter on the scuffed heel plate of the stool, revealing the matching purple stain on the skin. I know, cheap leather.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t something happen here?\u201d says I, just loud enough. Lil scowls and the grey rag, her sword, she\u2019s been swirling in the direction of the counter stills beneath her red-red nails.\n\u201cYou kids always ask that,\u201d says she, wringing the neck of the rag.\nI want to tell her I\u2019m no kid, but the noise outside of us tightens our bubble more. I guess any woman would look like a kid to her, if it suited.\nI\u2019m about to apologize, then remember Prin.\nLil flaps her grey flag of truce. \u201cApparently we\u2019re world famous for something. I say it\u2019s the food. But we get the creeps in often enough, looking for ghosts.\u201d She snorts, flinching an upnod at the vampires in the corner. \u201cLike those guys.\u201d\nHer concrete sweetness sets like burned sugar in the cracks of the counter. She knows nothing of creeps and ghosts and vampires, not really. At least, not here.\nBoh nudges me, and I fork up another taste of my blackberry apple pie. \u201cYeah, how many went missing around here?\u201d\nLil stares, smiling, everywoman mask stiff. \u201cWhat do you mean, honey?\u201d\nI don\u2019t like being called honey, but I don\u2019t say that either. \u201cHow many people went missing.\u201d\nLil shakes her head, still smiling.\n\u201cThe girls,\u201d mutters Boh, not loud enough, and I have to repeat it.\n\u201cThe girls. Who . . . went missing.\u201d I can\u2019t say it even now. \u201cThe hitchhikers. Six or seven of them perhaps. They were found in the creek down the back of this place.\u201d\nLil looks from table to table, but no one cares for her attention. The vampires are watching the TV, bored now.\nLil picks up the coffeepot, her shield, and prepares to make an unnecessary round. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you mean, honey.\u201d\nA trucker leers and slaps her bottom when she passes. I want to glare at him, but I don\u2019t dare. I let Boh do it instead.\nI can\u2019t finish my pie. The ice cream sits too cold behind my eyes. I pay, pretending my funds aren\u2019t running low, leaving a far too generous tip for Lil. I hope she can hide it quickly, that the avalanche eyes around here are slowed by their satiation.\nThe vampires want to leave first, must. I step aside quickly. They don\u2019t even have time to sneer at a girl holding open a door. They slither through and ooze away in their beat up Combi. Strange choice of transport for vampires, but whatever gets them away from here.\nMy feet and Boh\u2019s claws are too loud on the gravel outside the diner, but thankfully the noise is all our own. Boh mutters something about \u201cshut down,\u201d but when I look back her eyes have lost their glint, and I can\u2019t ascertain the direction of their stare. I do my best to ignore it, as I have done well to ignore all breathy imprecations since . . . forever.\nWe find my sedan cowering in the shadows. Ten ghosts sit on the hood and roof, waiting for us, wanting a lift.\nTen. They all frown at my feet, and I shrink a little further into my baggy clothes.\nSomehow we fit them all in. It helps that a few of them are missing limbs. One crouches in the back window, her head as loose as one of those nodding dogs.\nBoh puts us back on the blacktop, and it is daytime again. We share the comfort of the white noise for a long time after that.\n* * *\nThe last hitcher I pick up is a mermaid.\nI\u2019m only a couple hundred kilometres from the coast. I pretend I can smell it, a great wet suffocating magnet stuffing itself down my throat. Not even the hard mints can dispel the promise of mud upon my tongue.\nThe mermaid sits on a stack of tyres which gleam like liquorice in the heat. She flicks her copper pot tail in an obscene gesture for every car that speeds by. She\u2019s gorgeously fat, brown skin like warm canvas over her rolls, moonlight Rubenesque.\nI\u2019m next in line. She sticks out her thumb, two-inch nails curving suggestively against her wrists, and flicks ropes of hair so long and black I can\u2019t tell where they end and the tyres begin.\nI pull up, buzz down the window and ask the inevitable question. Her hint of pearl teeth and droop of fly-wing lashes are reply enough.\n\u201cI\u2019m LaFel,\u201d says she without preamble once she\u2019s ensconced in the front passenger seat. \u201cJust aim straight and true and you\u2019ll get me there.\u201d\nI offer her my name, still moist from Boh\u2019s belly, upon request. She accepts it with good grace. I tell her it does in a pinch, and I know pinches well.\n\u201cBe grateful you don\u2019t have mine,\u201d says she, rearranging her carpet of hair, braiding here and there as the car reaches white noise. She launches into the tatty story with a practised lilt.\nShe patiently waits for me to laugh and I do so to humour the flow of her story, though I\u2019m more sad than tickled. She doesn\u2019t need or want my pity, so we leave the burst of laughter on the side of the road some ways back, staring after the dissipating cloud from the arse of the car.\nHer father, LaFel explains, named her when her mother, the fish, gallantly passed on the naming duties. Mother had wheezed out her favourite joke: \u2018Call her anything,\u2019 said Mother, \u2018just not late for lunch.\u2019\nFather, being of the coyote persuasion, had done just that, and forever Late For Lunch she was.\n\u201cYou\u2019re part coyote?\u201d observe I.\n\u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d\nI try on humour for size, but my laughter gets left on the side of the road, staring after the car, perplexed.\nShe knows an awful lot about seafood restaurants, and I allow her to regale me with stories about lobster liberation and cosmetic shark fin restoration. She makes me promise not to eat salmon ever again; seeing no bear in me, she is satisfied by my answer.\nIt is only a few short hours until we reach the ocean. We sit in a beach car park, eating fish and chips from steamy newspaper, fingers greasy, the roofs of our mouths whipped to shreds by the heat and salt.\nWe pick at our teeth with the bones, and I tongue the strips of skin off my gums and cheek.\n\u201cSo here we are,\u201d says LaFel, rubbing fat into her skin until she smells just as delicious as dinner.\n\u201cSo here we are,\u201d repeats I.\nI follow LaFel out onto the sand, locking up the car carefully. She sits at the edge of the water for a while, playing with the tide until it\u2019s happy, nipping at her tail fins.\nI look out over the grey water, eyes shaded because that\u2019s what you do by the water even when the sun is indisposed. Then I look back at the road. I can only see the last few metres I have come.\nI take off my purple-black shoes and wiggle my toes into the sand. It\u2019s a lot colder than I expect. It soothes the blisters and burns. The bruises are fading to yellow by now, a jaundiced sunset.\nBefore LaFel has the chance to clear her throat, the ocean churns a ways off the beach; far enough we don\u2019t feel its invective, but close enough that the tentacles can\u2019t be missed. LaFel waves back at the green-black beast dusted with seaweed and precious jewels, and a mournful groan shivers the salt and sand.\nLaFel looks from the shoes in my hand to the beast.\nShe smiles. She waits.\nWaiting for what? The sun to show itself perhaps, or a shout? But no sign offers itself.\nOne more glance at my slowly healing feet.\nNo more.\nI sacrifice my leather shoes to the Kraken. The beast catches them, one two, slurping them whole, one two, into its circular toothy maw.\nGone. So easily, so hard.\nWith a wave much like a salute, the Kraken sinks beneath the waves.\nLaFel also slips into the water. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me? Mermaid populations are slipping. Something about sailor\u2019s calls, so I hear. We can always do with fresh blood.\u201d\nShe says nothing about luck, and I am grateful for that.\nAnd then she\u2019s gone, without waiting for my reply.\nKeys jangle loose in my hand as I put the car between me and the road. I pull my comfortable sneakers onto my still very much dual feet. I stare at the water long enough that the windows steam up.\nThe car starts again, and the windows defog.\nUnicorn, werewolf, dragon. I may have made friends, but I can\u2019t rightly tell. Friends; the word is empty of air until I blow gently across the top of it.\nThe tyres make an altogether different crunch on sand. Once I hit the wetter sand I take it slow, driving up and down the beach, avoiding hematoma sand castles, and the teeth and fingernails of broken bottles and shells.\nI check I have enough gas.\nAll signs point to Yes.\nThe car hits the water, slowly at first. The bow wave is ugly, but once I\u2019m up to speed, there\u2019s little splash at all.\nA graduate of Clarion 2014, AJ Fitzwater has been published in venues like Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Lethe Press\u2019s Heiresses of Russ 2014, Wily Writers, and previously in the January 2014 edition of Betwixt.

Johnson","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"The Electron\nElectrons are legion. You can\u2019t throw a transistor without touching an electron. Given the vastness of the universe, goes the folk wisdom, electrons must number beyond conception.\nBut electrons are famously alike: they all have the exact same mass, the same spin and electric charge, the same bowl haircut, and the same hackneyed opinions on the economy, no matter where or when you find one. This is often attributed to a rigid schooling system, or to a complete lack of schooling; in the 1920s some observers held both opinions simultaneously.\nThe truth is both simpler, with no moral for our own educational system, and utterly stranger. For there is only one electron, just one in the universe.\nThe key to unlock this mystery is the electron\u2019s antimatter twin, the positron. The positron appears to be everything the electron is not: he has positive charge rather than negative, points his spin up rather than down, votes the straight Republican ticket, and so on. If you were dating an electron your mother would wish aloud you were seeing a nice positron instead.\nBut a positron is not the opposite of an electron. It is an electron going backward in time.\nTake a video of an electron, run it backward, and you will be shocked to see a positron. It curves to the right rather than to the left in a magnetic field, eats dessert first and salad last, cries at the beginning rather than the end of Old Yeller.\nYou probably know the old wives\u2019 tale that when an electron and a positron meet, they both disappear in a flash of gamma rays. Old wives in fact spend their time conducting careful physics experiments, and this tale like many others is correct.\nCorrect, that is, from a human point of view. But from the electron\u2019s point of view something different happens. The electron decides to dig in its heels, sparking gamma rays, and reverse course. But instead of going backward in space, heading west rather than east, it goes backward in time, and is now, to us humans, a positron. The electron thinks it hasn\u2019t changed at all.\nAnd so the calendar flips backward, be it a few microseconds or a billion years, until the positron reverses course again in another shower of gamma rays and moves forward in time. To us humans, shackled by entropy to the forward lumbering of time, it appears a gamma ray creates an electron and a positron.\nYet it is really just the sole electron wearing two faces, as it weaves itself back and forth across the universe and across time. And when you see, for example, an atom of antimony buzzing with dozens of electrons, each electron is the same electron. The electron in this orbital is in its youth, the electron in that orbital is in its distant old age, having traveled to the end of the universe and back many times, and the electron over there, flirting with a photon a fraction of its age, is at the height of a billion-year midlife crisis, feeling both crowded and yet always alone.\nThe Neutrino\nThe neutrino is cousin to the electron, part of the grand clan of leptons, named after the Greek word for light-fingered. Long ago, when prejudice and stereotypes were fashionable, it was held that leptons were pickpockets, thieves, and con artists. The neutrino of legend was portrayed as a bandit, famous for stealing from rich and poor alike (indifferent to its victims\u2019 economic status, it was called il neutrino in Italy).\nIt was thus dismissed as mere myth, even though in 1930 Wolfgang Pauli proposed to take seriously the existence of the neutrino after his wallet went missing on a train platform in Heidelberg. Other physicists, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg among them, instead proposed the possibility that money was simply not conserved on the quantum level. The neutrino remained an unknown until 1956, when Cowan and Reines published a splashy expos\u00e9, complete with scandalous photo of a Hollywood Hills pool party, in the pages of the Physical Review.\nThe reason the neutrino gained a reputation for being hard to find, as well as a thief and a pickpocket, is the lack of a money trail. Neutrinos\u2019 spiritual beliefs do not allow them to use cash, to say nothing of credit cards, and even personal checks and money orders are forbidden. They rely on the generosity of strangers for a meal or a bed. No wonder neutrinos, with this extreme asceticism, are so thin that they were originally thought to be massless and remain nearly impossible to detect.\nNeutrino religious beliefs, spectacularly divergent from Western traditions, have attracted the attention of scientists and science-fiction writers alike, and in recent years there has been a fad among SF authors to write in the voice of the neutrino, the most famous work being Le Guin\u2019s The Left-Handedness of Darkness. This in turn has led to criticisms and claims of inappropriate appropriation, not least because most authors of a nonneutrino origin (aside from Le Guin, who had done her research) do not properly use the term handedness and were oblivious to the difference between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.\nBut these are all human words. For the most part neutrinos, as they are wont to do, have held silent, gliding ghostlike through the cosmos, just watching and listening. Perhaps we should learn to do the same.\nThe Quarks\nQuarks never appear in public alone but always in tightly knit groups of three. This inspired Murray Gell-Mann to lift a word from a line in James Joyce\u2019s Finnegan\u2019s Wake: \u201cThree quarks for Muster Mark!\u201d Gell-Mann\u2019s coinage is deeply offensive to quarks; not only are they given a joke name rooted in Gell-Mann\u2019s need to show off the enormous range of his intellect, even worse, quark sounds vaguely like qv\u221drk, which cannot be translated in a family publication due to its obscene nature. Quarks refer to themselves by the phase Tr\u03c7c = 0, which roughly means those whose true character is hidden.\nQuarks are divided into six families, or flavors, as if they were blobs of ice cream rather than the building blocks of the universe. The most common are the up and down quarks, each individually small, but between the two of them they are the bedrock of protons and neutrons and planets and suns and indeed of all life. Quarks have their own names for their flavors, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to pronounce them.\nThe names given to the flavors have little to do with their actual characteristics. Down quarks have a cheery, light-hearted nature, while up quarks are famously afraid of heights. Strange quarks admittedly do favor unusual hobbies, such as collecting and sorting lizard teeth and learning Mongolian, but charm quarks are wallflowers, always too shy to dance and turning red at a request to speak in public.\nThe rarest of all is the top quark, discovered less than twenty years ago. It is sometimes called the Godzilla particle, as it is born in a fiery nuclear furnace, rises from the unknown depths of the Dirac sea, and outweighs the up quark in roughly the same ratio as Godzilla outweighs you and me. Unlike Godzilla, however, the top quark has never visited Tokyo, its closest brush with Japan being a fondness for karaoke.\nOn occasion a quark might briefly hook up with an antiquark, a combination called a mes\u00f3n after the kind of intimate Spanish inn they favor on such flings. But you will never find a lone quark, not out of unusual social dynamics, but out of fear of being groped by a physicist. And who can blame them? Physicists have spent millions of dollars and hundreds of man-years intensely searching for a singlet quark, like so many bachelors desperately scanning dating sites. Shrill protests that quarks should understand the scientists\u2019 intentions are good, and that it is all in the name of science, are misplaced. Stand back, my fellow physicists, and allow the poor quark its privacy.\nThe Photon\nElectrons, neutrinos, and quarks are classified as fermions, after the French l\u2019esprit ferm\u00e9, or \u201cclosed-minded.\u201d Fermions are notorious for their fixed opinions, lasting from the Big Bang until the end of time, and are so unwilling to hear another point of view they cannot stand to be even in the same room as another fermion. This is the famous Pauli exclusion principle (although the phrase itself originated when Wolfgang Pauli was banned from his aunt\u2019s Berlin apartment for breaking an antique china teacup), and it\u2019s a good thing. Without it chemistry wouldn\u2019t exist, or at least would be a much simpler subject, for the Pauli exclusion principle means that atoms with differing numbers of electrons behave in unique ways. Hordes of high school and college students sweating over cations and anions and titration and counting the number of bonds may not feel grateful, but imagine if all the chemical elements behaved exactly the same way: not only would sugar and salt and monosodium glutamate and capsaicin all taste the same, there\u2019d be no difference between a balsamic vinaigrette and a yeasty weissbier, or between beef jerky and a shimmeringly translucent slice of fugu.\nA photon, however, is a boson, pronounced BOZE-on, like Bozo the Clown, and indeed photons are the clown princes of the subatomic world, quick with a joke, a magic trick, a song, anything to light up a smile. Unlike the single-minded electron, photons are fickle, quick to change their opinions, and easily swayed. Because of their malleable nature, photons and other bosons do most of the work of the subatomic world. The force between two electrons is really photons ferrying momentum back and forth. Photons spring up at the snap of an electron\u2019s fingers, carry out a task, and then quietly disappear again. Photons illuminate a room, cook your microwave supper, carry messages like pigeons between cell phones, make a shadowgraph of your teeth for your dentist.\nThere is a dark side to all this. Not only is it easy to make a photon agree with you\u2014a few seconds is all it takes to get a photon nodding that yes, it is night even if the clock reads 2 p.m., and that blindingly bright object in the sky must be the moon\u2014it is even easier to get a roomful of photons in perfect agreement. Among humans we call such a thing a political convention, but for photons it is called a laser. A laser is nothing less than an army of photons marching in lockstep, left-right-left-right. A small platoon of photons powers the laser in your Blu-ray player and at the supermarket checkout, but don\u2019t cheer yet: add more and more photons, and eventually you have a villain\u2019s death ray, all on the backs of billions of cheerful photons, swarming in perfect agreement. Pause and think of that the next time you turn on a light.\nThe Higgs Boson\nThe Higgs boson has been nicknamed the God particle, an ironic name inasmuch as it came about because of a deal with the devil.\nSamuel Higgs was not the worst physics student ever, but he was the worst who refused to be washed out of graduate school. He failed quantum mechanics a record seventeen times in eleven different PhD programs, the last one being at the University of Southern Louisiana, Northern Campus, in Outchipoulas, Louisiana.\nOne night in a bar on the interstate just outside Lafayette, a woman of dubious repute named Lupita told Sam if he slit the throat of a chicken at a crossroads at midnight and poured rum into the bleeding wound, the devil would come and bargain for his soul. Desperate, Sam went to a liquor store and an all-night poultry farm and then drove a lonely country road to a crossroads. The humid air lay across his shoulders like wet laundry, and the cicadas sawed noisily at the darkness. His hand trembling, Sam took a swig of the rum, and held the struggling chicken down in the dirt.\nThe next morning, he awoke, naked save for a large Mexican sombrero, and found scattered in the dust several pages of handwritten equations written in a tiny, cramped hand.\nThe theory of the Higgs particle solved two long-outstanding problems in particle physics, not only the question of how can one justify an even bigger and more powerful accelerator, preferably near good skiing in Switzerland, but also the origin of mass and inertia, explaining why it is so hard for teenagers to get up in the morning.\nDespite the beauty of the theory, no one would publish an outlandish paper by a twenty-year graduate student. The devil had promised Sam the most important theory since Einstein, but he had not promised Sam credit.\nSam begged his second cousin Peter, also a physicist but with a classier accent, to submit the article under his name. A shy, quiet man, Peter Higgs put Sam down as first author, but a copy editor\u2019s error left Sam\u2019s name off, and ever after Peter\u2019s attempts to cite his cousin were chalked up to eccentric British modesty.\nWhen Peter Higgs won the Nobel Prize he offered his share to Sam, but Sam said it would just get sucked up by alimony to Lupita, whom Sam had married, then divorced, then married and divorced again. Sam now teaches physics to sullen premed students at a community college in Turlock, California, and at night can be found playing for a ska band in a dive bar.\nIn Geneva, physicists popped champagne (the real stuff, not just sparkling wine) and toasted one another. \u201cThe final piece of the puzzle!\u201d they crowed. The next morning, however, they shuffled to their offices with gray, hollow faces, not because of a hangover, but because they realized that if the Higgs boson were the last to be discovered, if there were truly no more particles, no more mysteries, then they felt very much like Sam Higgs, a man with a gaping void where he once had a soul.\nSuperstring Particles\nPhysicists congratulate themselves on their rationality. But even they are susceptible to the allure of shadowy conspiracy theories.\nThe problem is gravity. Gravity is hard to ignore: it causes apples and rock climbers to fall, water to flow downhill, faces to sag. Gravity guides the moon around the earth, the earth about the sun, the sun pirouetting through the galaxy.\nBut on a subatomic scale, gravity doesn\u2019t add up. You know how you thought you had enough money in your bank account, but when you finally sit down to balance the checkbook, you find, your face growing hot and stomach tightening into a sour knot, the numbers just don\u2019t add up? It\u2019s the same with gravity on the microscopic scale, only with really hard math and not the easy kind that caused you to fail calculus.\nThe solution, some physicists proposed over the objections of their struggling students, is even more, even harder mathematics. And so an elaborate, Rube Goldbergesque machinery was developed.\nMore math brought forth more particles. In the same way every particle has its evil twin antimatter antiparticle, goes the story, every particle also has a superpartner. Electrons are paired with selectrons, photons with photinos, quarks with squarks, and so on. This partnering is called supersymmetry, as if they were couples waltzing in perfect circles.\nNot a single one of these superpartners, to date, has been seen. Occasionally one or another particle accelerator lab will announce they have discovered a supersymmetric particle, but upon closer inspection it turns out to be crumbs from the technician\u2019s sandwich or the blond hair of a boyfriend. Still, this vast unseen particle mafia is invoked to ever so carefully balance the books so that the numbers for gravity add up. Behind the scenes, it is said, this hidden committee controls the greatest forces in the universe, manipulates the economy, picks the president, dictates to the UN.\nNot everyone agrees. Gravity is an illusion, some physicists say with a shrug. Not something devised by a pantheon of supersymmetric particles in a smoky room planning the fate of everyone, but an accident. We all want there to be meaning in our lives, to be able write down an equation and look at it and say, So that\u2019s why the tree fell on my house! That\u2019s why my sister got breast cancer! That\u2019s why my wife left me, why my boss won\u2019t give me a raise, why I have persistent bad breath. But there isn\u2019t always a reason, isn\u2019t always someone behind the curtain pulling strings. Life just happens, and we are all souls like so many electrons, ping-ponging our away across the universe, across time.\nDark Matter\nYet there are mysterious forces out there. Our mightiest telescopes see galaxies pinwheeling in space, held together by the bonds of gravity. But the grip of the gravitational force is greater than can be explained by the stars we count, greater even than the gravity generated by planets and clouds of gas drifting among the stars. When the cosmic account books are tallied up, all the quarks and electrons and neutrinos, etc., only contribute a small fraction to the weight of the universe.\nThe rest cosmologists call nonbaryonic dark matter. (The name doesn\u2019t actually mean anything; it is the result of a bet, with the loser having to slip a nonsense phrase into the scientific literature.) What this dark matter is made of is a mystery. It may consist of the fabled superparticles, such as photinos, but that is mere speculation. Daily we pass through the dark matter, like the luminiferous ether of the nineteenth century, and in quiet basements physicists with massive cryostats try to detect the quivering of individual atoms from the dark matter wind.\nThere are even stranger phenomena out there: the accelerating expansion of the universe, anxious to get away from itself; how our perception of time is woven from the gnawing growth of entropy. In the end, despite our city-sized accelerators and massive space telescopes, despite supercomputers and libraries full of intricate, subtle mathematics, it seems we only understand a tiny fraction. Why does the universe exist? What happens in the end, when the stars wink out and even black holes sublimate away? Are there twenty kinds of particles, or just one? Why don\u2019t we get the love we are so desperate for, and, equally, why does anyone love us at all when we are so ugly inside? Perhaps some future generation will answer these questions.\nThe Short, Happy Half-Life of an Elementary Particle\nIt\u2019s easy to think of elementary particles in cold, clinical terms, as part of an equation, or a table of statistics, or the clicks of a Geiger-M\u00fcller counter. But I\u2019ve come to know elementary particles a more personal way.\nMy wife and I were walking through the park one day when we came across a muon lying on the path, wheezing. \u201cOh my god,\u201d my wife said, pulling up short. Then she knelt down and put a gentle hand on his shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cJust a stumble,\u201d the muon said. \u201cBit of a doozy, that first step,\u201d he added, looking up.\nI knelt by my wife. \u201cMust have been produced by a cosmic ray,\u201d I said to her, as I helped the muon to stand. \u201cHigh-speed protons hit the atmosphere, produce pions which then decay to muons.\u201d\nMuons are cousins to the electron, with nearly the same properties, but two hundred times heavier, making them prone to heart disease and diabetes.\n\u201cThank you very much, sir,\u201d the muon said, dusting himself off and giving a brief bow.\n\u201cDo you have somewhere to go?\u201d I asked. My wife tugged at my arm\u2014even though she was the first to go to his aid, I am the soft-hearted one\u2014but I stood firm.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the muon, scratching himself. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anyone around here. I hate to impose, but perhaps for just a night, until I get my feet. . . .\u201d\n\u201cWe have a comfortable couch,\u201d I said.\nAs our guest was washing up, my wife pulled me aside. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMuons are perfectly harmless,\u201d I said. \u201cThey can go effortlessly through several feet of solid steel. In fact, some people are trying to use muons to scan shipping containers at ports\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how attached you get. And\u201d\u2014here her gaze flicked in the direction of the bathroom\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t muons have very short half-lives?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cA few nanoseconds. Or maybe picoseconds.\u201d\n\u201cMuch shorter than a dog, then, and remember how devastated you were when we had to put her down? You couldn\u2019t go out for a week.\u201d\nI waved a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. A muon isn\u2019t a pet.\u201d\nIn the morning I pressed breakfast on the muon, who first demurred, but then devoured a huge plate of eggs and bacon and a bowl of cooked oatmeal covered with brown sugar and cream. \u201cYou are a most generous host,\u201d he said as he pushed himself from the table and tried to hide a small belch. \u201cAnd I really can\u2019t impose any further. I suppose I should go look for work.\u201d He stared down at the floor, for, really, what work could a muon with a short resume find?\n\u201cListen,\u201d I said. \u201cI happen to be a physics professor. I\u2019m sure I can find something for you around the lab.\u201d\nThe muon was a big hit with our junior physics majors, regaling them with stories of the subatomic world and the constant bashing of cosmic rays on the upper atmosphere, how traveling at close to the speed of light slows down time exactly as predicted by Einstein\u2019s relativity. \u201cWow, Professor Johnson, he really makes it come alive, you know?\u201d one student said to me.\nThat night after dinner I took him down to the university pub, where we ran into a knot of cosmologists, and together we drank late into the night, speculating on the nature of the universe and cursing the university administration. The muon knew a surprising number of dirty jokes, most of them involving deans, vice-chancellors, and provosts, and had us laughing so hard we could hardly breathe.\nAnd so the muon and I became fast friends. We didn\u2019t go out to the pub often, for which my wife was silently grateful, but we frequently stayed up late talking. Sometimes it was about semiotics and signs, sometimes it was gossip over politics in physics funding. One of our biggest running battle was what sport constitutes football.\n\u201cThere\u2019s football,\u201d I said, \u201cand then there\u2019s soccer.\u201d\nThe muon shook his head. \u201cYou Americans.\u201d\nThat night I slipped into bed as quietly as I could. In the darkness my wife spoke. \u201cHave you noticed how gray he\u2019s getting?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all getting gray, my love,\u201d I said, though my heart beat a little faster.\n\u201cAnd he moves a little slower, especially in the mornings, have you noticed?\u201d She turned over and put a hand on me. \u201cHe\u2019s been a good friend, and I like him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\nI must have been in denial nonetheless, for the end came quickly, more quickly than I expected. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the muon said, wheezing on our bed where we had put him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to cause so much trouble.\u201d\nI squeezed his hand. \u201cNo trouble at all.\u201d\nHe decayed shortly after that, turning, as is the way of muons, into an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a muon neutrino. We buried him under an oak tree in the park, not far from where we first met him. My wife put her arms around me and laid her head upon my chest. As a eulogy I said, \u201cOver a century ago we physicists believed the universe was invisibly filled with a luminiferous ether. Today we say it\u2019s the Higgs field. A hundred years from now we may postulate something else entirely. But then and now and until the day the sun dies, there is one true constant we search for, one thing we seek to fill the emptiness inside. Love. Love and friendship. And for that there is no theory.\u201d\nC. W.

I don\u2019t know why, so I fill it up by staring at it until my head throbs and eyes burn.\nI keep my backpack next to Gwen\u2019s (a ratty gym bag from her track days) in the closet. Every now and then, I check to see how heavy hers is, usually when she\u2019s at work.\nMost years, it\u2019s pretty full.

Every December he and his family have a bonfire. They toss all of their ill thoughts into that cinder block pit in his father\u2019s backyard. Then they drench everything in gasoline, toss in a match\u2014boom!\nMy family purged with sweat and earth: Mom and Dad would drag me to the top of Mesita Ridge, up among the brittle and crooked pines all stunted from acid rain. We\u2019d work with folding shovels in the thin air, our breath hovering over our heads, and we\u2019d bury each ill thought, smothering them all in the damp earth.\n* * *\nGwen\u2019s family has their own tradition. She took my last name, so we use her tradition\u2014only fair, right?\nA week before, we both go about shaping our ill thoughts.\nThe stuff drips and flows sluggishly like so much viscous tar, but it doesn\u2019t stick to you, strangely. We empty our bags onto the kitchen table (we cover it with newspaper, thank you), and we mold each ill thought until it\u2019s roughly disk shaped. Then we dry each disk with a blow dryer and toss them back into the bags.\nI pack the Toyota. She packs the Browning. It\u2019s an over-under, the kind the Olympians use\u2014a combination of sleek, oiled walnut that shines in the sunlight and cold, gilded steel that never heats up no matter how many times you fire the gun. Her mother (but not her father) shot skeet, and mother and daughter have sharp green eyes that see all.\nThen, we drive. North. Up along the winding, snaking coast.\n* * *\nWe always climb to the top of the tallest dune. We set up shop among the dried kelp and waving, struggling grass.\nWe stand facing the Pacific, watching the whitecaps below, letting the spray rise up and salt our hair and clothing.\n\u201cYou or me?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cYou first, Miss Oakley.\u201d\nShe smiles at that. She handles the shotgun and asks for a few particular ill thoughts.\nThe disks cry out (I regret never finishing college. I think the mole on my shoulder is cancerous. Sometimes, I feel empty at night.), so it\u2019s easy to find the ones she wants.\nShe asks for the fear about never being able to balance family and work.\nBoom!\nShe asks for another. This one\u2019s the frustration she carries toward her mother for hounding her about grandchildren.\nI toss them into the air, flinging them like Frisbees\u2014I\u2019ve gotten good.\nThe shots pierce my eardrums, even though I\u2019m wearing earplugs. Thoughts and emotions explode into dust with each hit. Acrid smoke tickles my nose. Those lean, slender fingers move deftly, reloading.\nThen she asks for the doubts she has about us.\n\u201cGive me the one about how we\u2019ll never travel like you promised.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nBoom!\nI fling more into the air.

I nearly drop it, surprised.\n\u201cEasy, Butterfingers,\u201d she says, smirking.\nBoom!\nMy turn.\nShe throws my disks straight out toward the water so they\u2019re easier to hit (she likes hers to fly at an angle, like startled geese).

Then we sit and talk.\nWe talk about each ill thought. These talks hurt, like picking at a scabbed-over cut, but they\u2019re necessary\u2014part of the yearly process, part of our tradition. Some don\u2019t talk about what they purge, but we try to. It\u2019s all on the table. So what other choice do we have?\nSometimes there are tears. Sometimes we argue. Sometimes we\u2019re quiet. Other times, like this time, we talk. It\u2019s fine.\nIt feels good, some years, to pick up our empty bags.\nBut other years, even as we\u2019re heading back down toward the car, I notice that her bag isn\u2019t quite empty\u2014that she already has new doubts.

The rest of the way you\u2019ll travel on foot. You\u2019ll drop your gear\u2014the gray curl of your bedroll and the blackened pot with the mismatched lid, even the punched-leather satchel they gave you in Arthurstown. But you\u2019ll keep your gun, the five-pointed badge that you wear on your chest, and the bandolier the dark-haired se\u00f1orita gave you.\nThe canyon\u2019s red-banded rocks look smooth, but up close you\u2019ll find they are like sandpaper. Your gun belt will twist and twist and twist and you\u2019ll have to keep righting it with your raw hands. The badge might catch and skitter and you\u2019ll probably lose a button from your shirt. That bandolier, with its big buckle, will certainly scrape a fingernail passage when you suck in your chest to pass. But those things, the badge and the gun and the bandolier, you\u2019ll keep them just the same. Which is a curious thing, because that gun will not avail you, that bandolier is going to kill you, and the five-pointed star of purity is the reason that I came for you in the first place.\nTrust me when I tell you, this is how it always is. I\u2019m the Green Knight, and I have seen this time and time again. There\u2019s something about the receding border of the west that makes folk wild. Makes all kind of folk who in another time and another place would be sane and quiet, a shop clerk who hardly dares to smile at a young and pretty widow, a craftsman working in his shop alone. But the west is big, and it makes men big. They go around claiming to be the fastest draw, the longest shot, the steadiest hand, and each one of those in turn gets killed by the next; the fastest draw has a slow day, the longest shot doesn\u2019t notice the glint in the grass a half mile away. People look after that sort of thing themselves, no intervention needed. But when someone claims to be a just man and the people laud him as the perfect sheriff, then you enter my domain.\nEvery time I\u2019ve offered a sheriff the chance to play a dueling game they\u2019ve come out into the main street and shot me dead right then. Nobody minds an easy win when a township is huddled and afraid. But when I pick my body up and remind the sheriff to come to me, come get the same in a year, well then those men they rue their haste and the town laments, as if open murder was somehow less despicable than a miracle.\nEvery man jack of you who plays the game starts to feel the dread almost as soon as I\u2019m gone. Even before someone can throw a shovel of ash over the blood on the floor, that dread comes stealing in. Some of them run, and some of them don\u2019t. In the end, though, every one of those honest men eventually comes down over that green ridge. He\u2019s glad to water his horse there at the ranch, glad to take a bed, drink the coffee, eat the bacon. Every one of them agrees to give any gift from the se\u00f1orita back to her father, but aside from you no one\u2019s ever grassed it up.\nWhen most folks figure it out, they panic. Sometimes they\u2019ll take a cheap shot, drawing quick when they see me waiting with my axe under the tree. Sometimes they crawl on bruised-up knees and beg. When I swing the axe they shy like mustangs, some raise up their dirty hands as if that could protect them. And so they lie all jumbled moldy bones, on the floor of the Green Chapel; it\u2019s how the place got its name.\nYou, though, you\u2019re an altogether different sort. Of all the men who\u2019ve met me here, you\u2019re the first to play the game very nearly fair. You gave me all the kisses you had collected, in exact proportion, and returned to me every gift you won. Well, almost.\nSee, I know the bandolier that falls across the shoulder sinister, for my daughter made it. What good is it to you? When you agreed to play the game you shot me dead, so now I know your bullet is already spent, and my weapon in this year-long duel is an axe. I suppose she told you that the bandolier was lucky, that it could preserve your life.\nI cannot fault a man for loving life, for once upon a time I did too. But a life too long is wearying, and sometimes a little envy passes with me through the chapel green. So when you come before me and I slice your neck, not deeply for your faults aren\u2019t deep, but enough to scar your face, will you understand that the suture of a broken bone, the knit flesh of a scar, these imperfections are by far the tougher place?\nI\u2019ve played the game so long I began to doubt that it would ever end. It\u2019s weary work, all this baiting of sheriffs, all this chopping off of heads. You\u2019re the nearest thing I\u2019ve seen to goodness, flawed and toughened as you are. I am old and my perfection makes me brittle, like an apple branch in winter, like stained glass above an altar stone. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m tired of it all, I don\u2019t think tired is in my nature. But I\u2019ll tell you, boy, I\u2019m not sad to see you coming sideways through the red-stone canyon, to see you picking your way over the uneven ground all mossy-green. I\u2019m not sad to see you standing there, head down like the head of a man in prayer, but the hand on the grip of your gun taut as dried leather.\nI pit your honor against my cunning, your will to live against my numbered days. So bare your neck to me and be ready at last to trade a blow for a blow, and call the Green Knight\u2019s bluff.\nTam MacNeil is a writer of fantasy and science fiction, and a fully-oathed, VP16-graduated imbiber of whiskey and gin.

It is still spotted with the president\u2019s blood\u2014and her sister Jadzia\u2019s, a testament to the violence that until recently had consumed the small country of Kerna.\nSome call Kerna the seven-times kingdom, but despite this impressive title, it goes largely ignored by all save for the most fastidious of cartographers. And why not? Perhaps magic once existed in Kerna, but now it is a place where firebirds are more likely to be seen in museums, stuffed and moldering, than in gardens. What little interest the rest of the world had in the country had died off when the USSR collapsed and the Russians left their tanks and fragmented ideology behind, abandoning Kerna in favor of capitalism.\nRuta herself can hardly blame the world for its apathy. Marzanna, the lady of blood and winter, had been the first queen of Kerna, and her patronage had doomed it to be a nation of ghosts as well as wonders. No one knows this more than Ruta herself; she can almost feel the dead clinging to her lashes and fingertips like snowflakes.\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d Ruta asks, running her hand across the sleeve of the bloody jacket. She feels as if she had just been presented a dead sparrow by a cat, one now seeking her approval of his grisly prize. Is this a misguided attempt to appease her grief?\n\u201cWe were talking about putting it in a museum. You know, as a historical artifact. But we decided it should belong to you,\u201d the soldier says with a shrug. He has a chiseled jaw and dark, tousled hair that looks like the feathers of a blackbird. But even if Ruta had been interested in boys, his gift of the peacoat still would have blackened her assessment of his character.\nRuta sighs. They should have washed her sister\u2019s blood off of the coat before giving it to her. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d she says and tries to thrust the bundle back at the soldier.\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to give it to you,\u201d he says. \u201cGregory Kruszon himself gave the order.\u201d\nRuta does not care for Kruszon, the face of the revolution, or his orders. But in the end, she takes the coat. Winter has closed its jaws around the country, and warm clothing is scarce; she must take what she can get in Kerna.\nShe is not too proud for that.\n* * *\nRuta goes to live with Dimitri, who is her uncle by the happy accident of friendship rather than blood. But that does not make his house any less warm or his demeanor any less affable. He makes Ruta cups of smoky black tea and serves stack upon stack of buckwheat pancakes stuffed with salmon and fat dollops of sour cream. It is the food of comfort and love.\nRuta is grateful for both. She finds the world severely lacking in those forces as of late.\n\u201cHow was the funeral?\u201d Dimitri asks. \u201cI wanted to come myself, but you know. . . . The train lines. Most are still in ruins. I heard Wiatr had them blown up to stall Kruszon and your sister when they were marching on the capitol. I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to get here yourself.\u201d\nRuta shrugs. She blows a puff of air into her teacup to cool it, hoping the pause will give her time to assemble her thoughts. \u201cIt was a funeral,\u201d she says at last. \u201cIt was all very grand. Everyone saluted her and wore their biggest hats and their nicest furs. The eulogy made Jadzia seem like someone from a myth. They\u2019re even going to name a street after her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s. . . . That\u2019s good,\u201d Dimitri says. \u201cJadzia was very loved. And very brave. She deserves it, after all she did for this country.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ruta says.\nShe does not add that her sister abandoned her to become a war hero, and that she will never forgive Jadzia for it.\n* * *\nDimitri\u2019s house, welcoming as it is, is also cramped. The only proper room Ruta could sleep in has been colonized by her uncle\u2019s large collection of scholarly texts, and he looks sheepish as he places a pile of bedding in her arms.\n\u201cI\u2019ll clean out my office in the next few days, I promise. I hope you don\u2019t mind sleeping in the attic until then,\u201d Dimitri tells her. \u201cThere\u2019s a mattress up there, and I\u2019m sure that I can find a bed frame somewhere in town. People are selling off whatever they can\u2019t burn for fuel nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be comfortable,\u201d Ruta says.\nThe attic is indeed as pleasant and snug as Dimitri claimed, and the doves that have made their home the rafters coo in greeting as Ruta hoists herself up from the trapdoor. But she is too tired to appreciate their songs or the soft, pink light of the setting sun creeping through the gaps in the siding. Ruta collapses onto the straw mattress in the far corner and is asleep within moments.\nA rather large part of Ruta hopes she will not wake up.\nShe is roused in the middle of the night by a string of curses muttered by a man who clearly has just bashed his shin on the miscellaneous flotsam of life Dimitri has accumulated.\nHer uncle must have come upstairs to check on her, Ruta thinks, and sits up. No thief would ever bother with the house, not when the thin chickens in the yard and the porch sagging with rot are clearly visible from the roadside.\nBut when her eyes adjust to the gloom, she sees that the intruder is not Dimitri.\nIt is Ales Wiatr.\nWiatr was a large man in life, but in his dark suit and tie, he seems so massive that Ruta believes he could swallow the moon if he were inclined to.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jadzia\u2019s sister, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Wiatr said. \u201cThe other Lato girl. The living one.\u201d\nRuta squeezes her eyes shut. After this nightmare, she will greet the waking world with a smile; it may be as gray and hopeless as the words in a newspaper, but at least sister-killing madmen cannot appear in her bedroom there.\nRuta opens her eyes, but Wiatr has not vanished.\n\u201cYour sister never struck me as a sentimental person, but even I was touched when I saw that locket with your picture in it,\u201d Wiatr continues, as if appearing in the bedrooms of teenage girls is an ordinary part of his daily routine. \u201cUnless, of course, that was a publicity stunt to make her seem more sympathetic. She could be a bit of a cold fish.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ruta says. Discovering what a ghost wants is the first step toward banishing it, is it not? But more than that, she cannot bear to hear Wiatr talk about Jadzia any longer. Every word he speaks about her is blasphemy in Ruta\u2019s mind.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything,\u201d Wiatr says. \u201cThere are better people to haunt than you.\u201d\nRuta bares her teeth, her earlier terror draining like blood from a wound. Wiatr infuriated her in life, and death seems to have only enhanced her natural response to him. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d she snaps.\n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to leave,\u201d Wiatr replies.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ruta says, just to fill the silence that stretches between them like barbed wire.\nIt is difficult for her to argue with that.\n* * *\nThe next morning, Wiatr is gone and Ruta entertains the hope that he might have been a nightmare. But when she goes downstairs for breakfast, he is sitting at the kitchen table, surrounded by glass jars of pickled cabbage and plates piled high with buttered toast.\nDimitri, who is occupied with frying slices of ham, does not appear to notice their uninvited guest. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he says brightly. He holds a book in one hand and a spatula in the other, which seems to sum up his character perfectly. Ruta has never been able to condense her own heart in such a manner; she has too many broken pieces for that.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Ruta says and sits down at the table, feeling defeated.\nThere are, of course, two possible explanations for Wiatr\u2019s presence. One is that the stress of the last few months has finally caused Ruta\u2019s mind to collapse and he is a hallucination. The other is that she is being haunted.\nThe first appeals to her much more, but there is an undeniable reality to Wiatr. She can smell his cigar\u2014tar, tobacco, herbs from across the sea\u2014over the much more pleasant auras of greasy meat and coffee. She knows the scent will cling to her clothes for days if she allows Wiatr to continue smoking, and she hisses, \u201cPut that out. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\nDimitri looks up from his book. \u201cPardon me?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI. . . . Nothing,\u201d Ruta says quickly. \u201cI was just talking to myself.\u201d But she glares at Wiatr until the dead man sighs and stubs the cigar out on the edge on the table. Rura can hear the wood sizzling beneath its tip, but she sees no evidence of the damage it should have caused.\nThat is more than can be said of Wiatr himself.\n* * *\nThe cold has driven the villagers inside, leaving deer and rabbits the only occupants of the woods along the fringes of the town. It is the most private place Ruta can think of to go, and Wiatr, bound to her by the inexplicable laws of the dead, follows her.\nThe trees here are the ones Ruta grew up with, and they are as familiar to her as her Dimitri himself. She takes off one woolen glove so that she can caress the slender trunk of a birch, and for a moment, she is happy. This tree was here when Jadzia and Wiatr were still alive, and Ruta imagines it will still be standing when she has gone to her own grave.\n\u201cYou have a lovely, warm house and you come out here to wander?\u201d Wiatr asks, and Ruta turns to look at him. He mimics being alive, his breath breaking from his lips in frosty plumes. Do all ghosts cling to this world with such tenacity?\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you with my uncle around without looking insane,\u201d Ruta says. When she cannot bear the sight of him any longer, she raises her head to watch the tin-colored sunlight spilling through the naked branches of her birch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you\u2019re the only one who can see me,\u201d Wiatr says.\n\u201cWho else would you talk to?\u201d Ruta asks. \u201cEveryone you knew is dead and the rest of the country hates you.\u201d\n\u201cThat apparently isn\u2019t stopping me from hanging around,\u201d says Wiatr. \u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t be a proper government-in-exile with no staff.\u201d\n\u201cA government-in-exile?\u201d Ruta says. \u201cYou were a tyrant. A monster. You took control in an illegal seizure of power\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMuch like the one that just took place,\u201d Wiatr says smoothly. \u201cWhat do you think a revolution is, my dear?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Ruta says. \u201cYou shot my sister in the head. Don\u2019t ever call me that.\u201d\n\u201cI. . . .\u201d Wiatr bursts out laughing. The sound is as foreboding as the church bells that originally announced his death.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ruta asks. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\nWiatr struggles to recover himself and wipes an imaginary tear from his eye. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill your sister,\u201d he says. \u201cKruszon did.\u201d\n* * *\nPresident Kruszon, newly appointed by the emergency government on the grounds that he served their revolution faithfully, appears on Dimitri\u2019s creaking porch a week after Wiatr\u2019s outrageous declaration.\nThe pistol that rides against his hip is much smaller than the machine gun he carried in the old world that contained both Wiatr and Jadzia. But to Ruta, his new suit is more alarming than either the pistol or the armed guards hovering behind him. It means he is here on state business, and she has had enough of that for a lifetime.\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s time you and I had a conversation,\u201d Kruszon says, and Ruta escorts him wordlessly inside her uncle\u2019s cluttered little house.\nDimitri turns pale as Kruszon passes, but Ruta is accustomed to being in the presence of gods and monsters. Jadzia was not afraid of Kruszon, and she refuses to be either; she will wear her surname as courage, just as she wears Wiatr\u2019s coat. Though privately, she thinks the jacket might be to blame for anchoring the dead tyrant to her.\nBut a coat is a coat, and Dimitri has no money.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to Ruta privately,\u201d Kruszon tells Ruta\u2019s uncle. He removes his leather gloves, and one of the guards steps forward to take them.\n\u201cAnd here he always billed himself as a man of the people, not a bourgeois monster like me,\u201d Wiatr says, smirking. The land of the dead he seems to half-occupy leeches the color from his skin more and more each day, and Ruta wonders how long he will retain even the sepia tones he is composed of now.\nHowever afraid he may be of the new president, Ruta\u2019s uncle opens his mouth to protest against leaving the room, but Ruta speaks before he can.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she says to Dimitri. \u201cI want to talk to him.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cYou killed my sister,\u201d Ruta announces once she and Kruszon are seated.\nShe expects the new president to react with outrage or dismiss the charge altogether. But Kruszon only finishes lighting his cigarette and waves it as a magician might wave his wand. Indeed, he looks like a man bent on rearranging the universe.\n\u201cWe needed a martyr,\u201d Kruszon says without shame. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t personal, Comrade Lato. I liked Jadzia. She was a good soldier.\u201d\nRuta places her shaking hands on the table to steady them, but there is nothing to be done about the industrial wheeze of her breath as she struggles to speak. If Wiatr has told her the truth about Kruszon and Jadzia, what other truths can he impart onto her like terrible gifts?\n\u201cIs that all she was to you?\u201d asks Ruta. \u201cA soldier?\u201d\n\u201cWe were all soldiers,\u201d Kruszon says. \u201cAnyway, you misunderstand your sister. She loved you, yes. But she wanted to die. If I hadn\u2019t granted her wish, she would have taken her own life inside a year. I can almost guarantee it. She took everything she did to heart, and those are wounds time will not heal.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Ruta says.\n\u201cI do, Comrade Lato. I don\u2019t know how you found out what happened, but I assure you, you\u2019ll be compensated for your loss,\u201d Kruszon says. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a pension for Jadzia\u2019s service. And your uncle tells me you\u2019re bright. It would be no hardship to pay for you to go to university.\u201d\nRuta can hardly believe what Kruszon is saying. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to trade my sister\u2019s life for university?\u201d\n\u201cYour sister is already dead,\u201d Kruszon tells her. \u201cYou\u2019re trading nothing. As I said, I\u2019m offering you some compensation for your . . . emotional distress.\u201d\nRuta wants to turn him down. She wants to tell him that she cannot be bought with pensions or consolation prizes dipped in blood. She wants to strike him and drive him from her adopted home.\nBut Wiatr speaks before she can banish Kruszon. \u201cTake it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably devise some accident for you if you don\u2019t, and money is the most powerful thing in the world. Well, money and books. Get an education and don\u2019t let your uncle starve.\u201d He shrugs his broad shoulders. \u201cIf you really hate Kruszon so much, there will eventually be an opportunity to kill him. If you cooperate now, he won\u2019t have any reason to see you as a threat in the future.\u201d\nThese are devious suggestions, and Ruta has never thought of herself as a devious person. But even through the righteous haze of her anger, what Wiatr says makes perfect sense.\nWhy die because of Kruszon like her sister?\nRuta purses her lips, which are cracked from the cold. Money will buy more firewood, she reminds herself, and she will no longer bleed for want of warmth. \u201cA lifelong pension,\u201d she says. \u201cA university education\u2014and a flat in the city. And you\u2019ll reinstate Dimitri at the university, too.\u201d\n\u201cWiatr expelled him from his teaching post?\u201d Kruszon says.\nWiatr flinches, his glasses riding up on the bridge of his nose. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019d known I would be haunting his house, I would have been a little less . . . hasty about firing him.\u201d\nRuta wishes Wiatr was physical enough to slap, but now is not the time to berate him for past cruelties. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, her gaze never leaving Kruszon\u2019s. \u201cHe taught literature.\u201d\n\u201cSurely we can find a place for him at the university again,\u201d says Kruszon, one corner of his mouth rising in a subtle smile. He stands and extends his hand toward Ruta to seal the bargain. \u201cAre we agreed then?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ruta says. \u201cWe\u2019re agreed.\u201d\n* * *\nRuta surrenders a little more of her bodily territory to Wiatr each day. They divide the life that had once been exclusively hers in two, as if she has penned a silent treaty between them.\nThey share kisses with strangers in the local bar, cups of coffee, and wool scarves. Ruta even allows Wiatr the decadent pleasures of chocolate and cigarettes every second Tuesday.\n\u201cYou\u2019re different,\u201d Dimitri says to her one spring day when Wiatr is wearing her skin as she often wears his bloody coat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t use to smoke.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t use to be a lot of things,\u201d Wiatr says, working Ruta\u2019s mouth like an instrument. Then he closes it around the filter of his cigarette.\nDimitri knows better than to question the whims and shifting temperaments of a teenager. If he is uncomfortable with how low Ruta\u2019s voice sounds, he does not say so. Dimitri gives her a tight smile before shuffling back into the kitchen.\nRuta senses that he is glad to be away from her.\n* * *\nRuta goes to university the next fall, her place secured by her promise to President Kruszon. Ruta\u2019s silence also procures her a flat, cramped but far superior to the mice-infested dorms her fellow students live in.\nHer classes are not challenging, and the faces of her professors blur together until she cannot say exactly which of the dusty academics teaches each subject. Ruta writes lines from Homer on her arms in Greek while one professor or another imparts nationalistic rhetoric to the blackboard.\nWiatr now has a distaste for said rhetoric and washes the Greek off their skin, his lip curled.\n\u201cAre you five? Don\u2019t draw on yourself,\u201d he mutters, lathering their arm in a fine layer of soap.\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of those conservative old men, aren\u2019t you? The ones who think tattoos will attract demons,\u201d Ruta says sharply.\n\u201cTattoos represent a certain amount of commitment. This is just juvenile,\u201d Wiatr says. He seems insulted by Ruta\u2019s comment, though she does not know whether it is being called old man or conservative that offends him.\nA month into her education, Ruta stops going to class, save for the days when there is an exam. She commits herself to Homeric poetry in the sense that she will now be buried with it running up the length of her left arm.\nShe brandishes the tattoo for Wiatr when the artist removes his needle from the skin, and he rolls his eyes. \u201cAt least it\u2019s good poetry,\u201d he says. \u201cLost is my homecoming. I think you and I understand that sentiment more than most.\u201d\n\u201cYou disapprove of what I\u2019m doing with my time,\u201d says Ruta. \u201cBut how else am I supposed to spend it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being so negative about all of this,\u201d Wiatr says. \u201cI had a wonderful time at university in spite of the dull classes.\u201d\n\u201cYou started a revolution when you were at university,\u201d Ruta reminds him.\nWiatr grins at her. \u201cExactly.\u201d\n* * *\nRuta wishes she could summon the same political fervor that consumed her sister, but it is not as easy to be a martyr for the cause as Jadzia made it look.\nTonight, Ruta is distracted by a girl named Alexandra and the feel of her breasts pressing against her arm as they weave through the crowded bar down the road from the university. She likes Alexandra, who laughs easily and finds Ruta\u2019s obsession with poetry endearing rather than strange.\n\u201cI think you may be in love,\u201d Wiatr whispers.\nRuta stays silent, though she is willing to consider it a possibility. And love is, by far, more interesting than politics.\nBut it is politics they have come to hear about tonight. Ruta and Alexandra introduce themselves to their fellow students, who greet Ruta with wary awe. Being a revolutionary, they assume, must be a genetic disease.\n\u201cI thought things would change,\u201d a girl named Anna says. \u201cYou know, when Kruszon deposed Wiatr. He promised to give us back our liberties\u2014but I don\u2019t see them.\u201d She pulls out one empty pocket for emphasis, as if freedom could be folded down to fit in such a space.\n\u201cWiatr was a capitalist pig,\u201d Nicholas says, pausing so that Ruta knows this is a preface to his real thoughts on the subject. \u201cWiatr was a capitalist pig,\u201d he repeats, \u201cbut at least under him, there was bread.\u201d\nIn a murky corner of the pub, Ruta hears Wiatr bring his fleshy hands together. \u201cBravo,\u201d he says. How Ruta is able to hear him above the dozen other conversations taking place in the bar defies all reason, but then again, so does Wiatr himself.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not praising him as a human being of course,\u201d Anna says quickly to Ruta, belatedly realizing that Nicholas\u2019s comment might be offensive to the memory of Jadzia. But Ruta can no longer remember the smell of Jadzia or the exact pitch of her voice.\nHer older sister never saw her go to university or get her tattoo, or watched her possibly fall in love with Alexandra.\nJadzia forfeited her place in Ruta\u2019s world when she joined up with Kruszon.\n\u201cNicholas is right,\u201d Ruta says with a shrug. \u201cAs it is, Wiatr didn\u2019t kill my sister. Kruszon did.\u201d\nShe enjoys the stunned silence that follows.\n* * *\nRuta grows more substantial, day by day, word by word, inch by inch. She allows herself the normally male pleasure of occupying more space in the world, spreading her legs on the subway to accommodate her newly acquired bulk, and she revels in it.\nThey revel in it, she and her ghost alike.\nThis is all part of the conquest.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take on a government when a good breeze will blow you away,\u201d Wiatr says. It occurs to Ruta that in fairy tales, food is always the tool the monster employs in his seduction of the heroine. But she and Wiatr are long past their original courtship. After all, she\u2019s known him longer now than anyone save Dimitri.\nIt is her uncle who looks haunted by her nowadays, just as she is haunted by her sister\u2019s false killer.\n\u201cCome home,\u201d Dimitri begs Ruta one day. The caf\u00e9 he found her in is anonymous enough that she does not attract a crowd. But there are ink stains running along the ridges of her palms, damning evidence that she has been speaking her mind again.\n\u201cHome?\u201d Ruta asks. \u201cTo what?\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe,\u201d Dimitri says, leaning in. \u201cKruszon will only tolerate so much. Jadzia\u2019s memory protects you, but for how much longer? It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to say you\u2019ve gone mad with grief and have you imprisoned for your own safety.\u201d\n\u201cGrief is like a knife,\u201d says Wiatr. His tomb-stale breath grazes the back of Ruta\u2019s neck. \u201cYou can either cut yourself on it or use it.\u201d\nRuta does not think he employed her mouth to dispense this bit of grim wisdom to Dimitri, but she can hardly tell these days when he is speaking to her and when he is speaking through her. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter. Sooner or later, they both echo each other\u2019s splendid and terrible ideas.\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d Ruta says. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so, and neither do the people of this country.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never join you,\u201d Dimitri cautions. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to live through another revolution.\u201d\n\u201cDo we ration such things now? Are we allowed only one in our lifetimes?\u201d Ruta says, laughing. \u201cI give this new movement credibility. I tell them my sister died for nothing, and they believe it because they love her\u2014and love me for my loss.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Dimitri says, \u201cyou sound like Wiatr.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he was right,\u201d says Ruta. \u201cAbout certain things, anyway.\u201d\n* * *\nThe age of thirty creeps up on Ruta. She has come to measure the passage of time not with coffee spoons but with broken glass and speeches, with the corpses of friends who litter her palace of memory like dead butterflies. Ruta\u2019s shared bones feel a thousand years older than they did on the day Jadzia died, but she has always known what she was getting into.\n\u201cYour sister,\u201d Kruszon says when at last Ruta lowers the barrel of her gun to his forehead on the final day of her revolution, \u201cwould be disappointed.\u201d\n\u201cMy sister is dead,\u201d Ruta replies. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to have an opinion anymore. You made sure of that.\u201d\n\u201cIs that all this is, then?\u201d Kruszon asks. \u201cRevenge for stealing something you loved?\u201d He looks up at her, his eyes bright with righteous tears. Ruta wants to strike the sermon from his mouth with the barrel of the pistol.\n\u201cYou always did think you knew best,\u201d Wiatr says through Ruta, but she bats him away like an unwanted thought before he can speak again.\nShe imagines that Jadzia was defiant in her last moments, just as the president is now. She must have thrown her head back like a wolf and howled in rage when she realized she was to be sacrificed.\nBut Ruta is tired, and Ruta does not want to be like her sister.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d Kruszon muses with the false wisdom of the damned. Death, Ruta has come to learn, does not enhance one\u2019s perception. Wiatr, for his cleverness, has not become enlightened in the years they have known one another. And if Kruszon decides to haunt some child Ruta herself robbed of a sister to complete the circle, she doubts he will either.\n\u201cUnlike you, Kruszon,\u201d Ruta says, \u201cI made peace with my ghosts. I adapted. That alone makes me more powerful than you.\u201d\nShe pulls the trigger.\nAs she watches Kruszon\u2019s body slump onto the carpet, Ruta thinks that revolution will always be a snake swallowing its own tail in the country of ghosts.\nMarian Rosarum is a fairy tale author and poet who divides her time between Colorado and Miami.

Within less than half an hour he had reached the Western Gate, and gone beyond it into the Beast Market, which was just then beginning to stir. There, he went up to a horse merchant and bought an old, sturdy mare from him. He then rode off along the Ria Velia, a busy cobbled street which by and by turned into a wide, much used thoroughfare. Taking a smaller road, he later made for the coast.\nNot many people noticed him, and certainly none of the merchants who made their way to and from the city. The horse seller, when he was asked a week later, did have a vague memory of him, as did a few passersby. A tall, bony, impressive man, he strode hastily but stiffly, as though wounded.\nOnly after two days had elapsed did they find the corpse of the painter, Master Ilios, sprawled on his back under a length of stiff canvas, his blood pooled thick beneath him, mingling with paint, the stench of rot covered by that of turpentine. By then, however, Dul Termes was long gone, his trail lost among the myriads of ports, bays, cliffs, and islets of the coast, and since then he has not been seen there.\nStill, a few months later, in a city far from the Inner Sea, a man could be seen who might have been mistaken for the magician, though he was far gaunter and paler. In inns and streets and in the dark, he spoke and spoke alone, telling the story of the painter, who had been his victim, and who had no one else now. When the story was done he told it again, speaking to a rapt audience seen only by him, and again, and again. Over the years the tale grew more rehearsed, though no less mad and muttered, and the man\u2019s life seemed to have withered around it.\n* * *\nAn explosion. An eruption. A briny puddle. The Inner Sea, a splash of water on a beach, a gasping man. His life began earlier, yet to us he was only an image of terrible loss. It is hard to convey what Tars meant to us. Even I, born a goat-herder on rocky hillside, had heard of it and of the legend of its bliss. It was, then it wasn\u2019t, and only he remained to remind us that it had not been a dream.\nTars! Blessed isle! Beautiful, wealthy, forbidden. Not a man had set foot on the island who had not been born there. Sailors were allowed on the wooden pontoons in the harbour of Semla but not one inch farther, and no man who had been born on Tars had ever set foot on any other shore, though some had sailed the Inner Sea. But the legend of Tars, nonetheless, escaped on the wind and the wine-dark breath of seafarers, who had seen the fair slopes of the hills, and the palaces, and the towers that soared to the heavens, the wind whistling between them as through one great harp. . . . They told stories of its loveliness, the happiness of its inhabitants, the deep knowledge of its scholars, the wisdom of its rulers. Nothing ever changed on Tars, they said; nothing ever needed change. O, the songs of the unshared bliss of Tars! With what enthusiasm they were sung, and how they galled, too!\nOne night it foundered, was torn apart, dropped to the bottom of the sea. The sound of the explosion was heard all around the Inner Sea. Why? My master, a true believer, spent months trying to discover the reason and the way. He had faith in his magic (though sometimes, for convenience, he would supplement his spells with a little potion or sleight of hand), and he had faith in Tars, the fount of all occult knowledge and supernatural workings. But he could find nothing, and by the time I left (taking most of his coloured powders and clinking runes) he was distracted enough not to notice my theft for\u2014oh, long enough. For him, and all others, there was no sense for the catastrophe in Tars.\nBut as for Master Ilios: he was found three days after the disaster, a gasping fish on a beach, pale and green and flapping weakly, grasping at the air and stuttering words of destruction, fire, water, steam, death. His sea-soaked garb was drab. So who was he? Nothing but the lowest of artisans, a hired brush, who stared at walls, drawing in palaces the arabesques and frescoes on which his betters rested their bliss-drunk eyes.\nIt did not matter. They took him out of his briny puddle, carried him into a hut, then into an inn, undressed him, dried him, dressed him, and all the while he spoke only of fair Tars, destroyed, and they nodded sagely, having heard the explosion, seen the fine ash rain down, and the stones too that had fallen from the sky (killing, it was said, a few sheep). But it seemed to him that they did not understand, could not understand\u2014hence the inane, unstoppable, apocalyptic babbling.\nAmong these curious onlookers was a servant of the duke of Respetzi, who promptly wrote to his master. Said master was quick to detect the increase in fame this little piece of speaking flotsam and jetsam might bring him. A carriage was dispatched, and the still-shocked Ilios bundled up, promised food and drink, and whisked away. The duke gave him rooms, shook his hands, wept on his shoulder, pressing him against his perfumed bosom in commiseration. He also took one look at Ilios\u2019s robes and promised him ten more, richer and more suited to his eminence, and had twenty made for his own use, though of velvet, brocade, and silk: Tarsan fashion, the height of refinement, copied a thousand times in the following years. (Ilios, tired and raspy voiced, had not managed to say loud enough that the robe was a gift from his innkeeper host.)\nHe was paraded from parlour to ballroom and back. And what was he? they asked. Back in Tars. A painter? But that was marvellous! A gifted people\u2014he must paint again. (Again he was unable to say that for the most part he had painted walls, following the instructions of his taskmaster.) He was swathed in luxurious clothes, perfumed, powdered, taken here and there in carriages, and for all this paid not with coin but with words\u2014words of Tars, its beauty and its end.\nI do not know how he felt then. By the time I met him the novelty of tragedy had worn off. He did not say, I did not ask, and who can know the workings of the mind of a man of Tars? He had had all and lost all, we thought. I do not think he realised, at times. I think that he must have awoken and believed himself back on his sunlit island\u2014and then that he must have sunk his head into lavender-scented silk, not the humble pillow of his hard little cot on Tars, and wept and sneezed with grief into his fine sheets. At times he must have groped for the dim, receding memory of his land; sometimes he must have wanted to drink it clean off his brain, to drown the sound of remembered lutes in the bustle and shrieks of the duke\u2019s ballrooms.\nHis grief had partly, temporarily stupefied him\u2014but not so much that he did not sometimes think of the future. Shrewdness and practical matters warded him from deeper thoughts. He hadn\u2019t been a great painter, not in the way they had thought him to be, but he learned. He had a deft hand and a keen eye, and he taught himself, painting serving wenches who pitied him, unlaced their lace caps though not much more, kitchen boys and stable boys. Afterward, he painted the children of the rich\u2014plump, rude, sad little boys and girls\u2014then their parents.\nI saw some of those paintings. We shared many of our patrons, and in a way our work was not always dissimilar: often, the casting of a fair reflection, the transformation of images. I saw his work evolve, from the cold, flat, precise faces of his early days. (I can see his kitchen maids, bending over his shoulder, adjusting their curls\u2014Is this really how I look?\u2014having only seen their reflections on the back of cooking pots.) Later, he grew better. Life and light infused his paintings. The duke, vexed because he had not been the first to be portrayed, almost threw him out but swallowed his anger eventually and hired him for an entire year and a half: during that time Ilios painted the duke three times, his children twice, his horses three times, his wife once, the dogs twice. The paintings were all hung in one bright, glass-roofed circular room. They were life-size, and visitors were known to be startled by this assembly of staring, repeated people: ladies and lords would, on entering, clutch their ribboned bosoms, shriek, dance away on the tiled floor, then laugh and examine the paintings, sighing and whistling and puffing away their admiration.\nA year or so after his arrival, having amassed a good deal of money, he went to a ship\u2019s captain and paid for his passage across the sea, to where Tars had once been. To his dismay, a flotilla of patrons and admirers followed, some in another ship, some (thanks to the captain\u2019s indiscretion and greed) on the one he had himself commandeered.\nThey sailed for three days, in grey, tepid weather. On the morning of the fourth day the sky was clear. Soon, the captain said, they\u2019d be within sight of the isle\u2014or would have been, had it still existed. Ilios clung to the railing and tried to ignore the chattering on deck, watching the prow slice the limpid, jewellike, all-devouring sea.\nAt last the captain, slapping Ilios\u2019s shoulder, pointed to some spot. \u201cThere!\u201d he said. From the water a knuckle of bare rock emerged, a thin, misshapen band of land, a finger from a submerged hand. The roots of the islet could be guessed at, shifting and dark, to a few yards below the surface, and then\u2014nothing. Hills and streets and palaces and streams\u2014nothing but salt water. He wept in his hands while a few noblemen, who for all their pride and wealth had never been allowed to set foot on Tars, clambered atop the rock and filled their pockets with pebbles and dust.\nWas it the sight of that abyss, where irretrievable Tars lay? At that moment the convergence of our fates (as I would tell my patrons) began; in brief, he became miserable enough to wish to seek out my services.\n* * *\nI met him through one of our common patrons, one Artelia Deregni\u2014a rich, merry merchant\u2019s widow with friendly, gold-ringed, pawing hands. I had cured her of a certain ache, and since then was also paid to help her communicate with the dead in the presence of her friends. I suspect she was something of a sceptic and an actress herself, though she never admitted as much. When I came in that day Master Ilios was painting her portrait. I would have waited in the antechamber, where she stored marvellous candied fruits, but she had me shown in. There she sat, ensconced in her armchair, a jolly puff of purple silk, gilt lace, and fat; and there, dark and narrow, sitting on a stool before her, a square of canvas between them, was Ilios.\nHe turned as I came in, mumbling a greeting. But when Artelia called me and named my profession, something more than surprise shot through his eyes. Desire, I said to myself, so much better than mere gullibility; an active, poignant longing for something. I must make inquiries about him, I thought, noting that while packing his paints and brushes he kept stealing glances at me. Lay bait. But there was no need for that: in the following weeks, as I learned from my gossipy patrons and fellow magicians, he made inquiries about me.\nHe learned about my skills, my deeds, my well-deserved reputation\u2014well-deserved, I say, because of all the work I\u2019d put into it, not necessarily true. He could have been an enamoured young maid, and I the mysterious stranger\u2014or was it the other way round? Then, nearly a month after we\u2019d first met, he came to me.\n* * *\nI spied him from a first-floor window. He was garbed richly, fashionably, in a dark red velvet doublet, breeches, with a half-cloak pinned to his right shoulder; but he shifted from one foot to the other like an impatient child. I let him wait for a minute or two before pulling the rope that by means of pulleys and wheels opened the front door soundlessly. He looked a little surprised as the door swung back before him, but walked in at once.\nI found him in the antechamber and led him to my parlour, where sputtering candles burned between dark walls. He followed me, aloof yet fretful, and I could not help but feel thrilled, in spite of myself. But then I had not spent fifteen years apprenticed to my old fool of a master without having some of his superstition rub off on me . . . and yet, how unremarkable he looked, too, how\u2014like all my clients\u2014pathetic in his longing. At first he merely sat, observing and wringing his hands a little under pretence of twisting a ring on his finger. At last he spoke.\n\u201cYou will think me mad,\u201d he said.\nHow often I had heard those words, or some variation, uttered by my clients, usually before their trite, tepid version of a perversion I had heard a hundred times before. But Ilios, unlike most, seemed neither brash and boastful nor slimy with the taint of fear. He looked resigned and too quiet.\n\u201cNo, my lord. I would see a brave man, one to which I would harness my powers without shame or fear.\u201d\nThe glance he cast at me was unexpectedly sharp, dark brows furrowing suddenly.\n\u201cWithout shame or fear, yes. But can you do it?\u201d\nI shrugged.\n\u201cThere is little that lies beyond my powers. Tell me.\u201d\nHe nodded, but since he did not appear to continue, I rose and poured him some wine from a silver decanter into a gilded glass. It was sweet, spiced wine, and quite strong, though the taste of sugar hid that of alcohol. He drained it at once and I, to put him more at ease, took a more cautious sip. Sighing, he leant back in his armchair, and laid one brown, narrow hand across his eyes. Well, I was accustomed to waiting.\nA minute or two elapsed and again he sighed, but this time he spoke too, weary and low. His hand slipped from his brow.\n\u201cYour business is the making real of things thought impossible, is it not?\u201d\nI nodded, but he was not looking at me.\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am a painter, as you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Quietly, smoothly, like a voice in his thoughts. Again his hand twisted nervously.\n\u201cHave you ever tried to make a painting come alive?\u201d\nThis was a novel request, and for a moment I was dumb. But then, was not half my trade in such illusions? The business of loss, bringing the dead back to a dim, brief (painted, wigged) life?\n\u201cIt has not yet been attempted,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut if all my learning is true, then it may be possible.\u201d\n\u201cYou will try, then?\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d A pause. \u201cI will need time.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. And money, I assume.\u201d\nI shrugged.\n\u201cIt will be an honour to work for you, my lord.\u201d\nAgain that quick, rueful glance\u2014the eyes of one who, I suspected, had been ignored for most of his life before being showered all at once with honours, graciousness, flattery, gifts. Well, I had been apprenticed fifteen years to a mangy alchemist, and before that a peasant\u2019s son; before rising all at once. I knew that gaze, had mistrusted offers given too freely, suspecting them of not being free at all, and so I changed my tune\u2014a little.\n\u201cI will require money, of course. But as I said, I have never attempted the deed, and so do not know how much will be needed. Shall we agree to work together, nonetheless?\u201d\nHe acquiesced, wary of me and, I suspect, of his own hope.\n\u201cYou will need to see the painting, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I shall come, unless you prefer to bring\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, laughing nervously. \u201cYou must come.\u201d\nThat time, as I bade him goodbye, I did not understand. I imagined the portrait he wanted me to bring to life. Some beauty, probably, a bright youth with shining eye and smooth flesh, and an inward, still smile. I thought of the accomplice I might need to hire, some player bought with Ilios\u2019s coin to fulfil his painter\u2019s fantasies.\n* * *\nBut he\u2019d meant what he said: I must come to him. He gave me an address, which turned out to be that of a former warehouse that he used now as a workshop. I went there and he met me, alighting from a carriage. He was dressed more plainly this time, wearing only simple linen clothes beneath his rich cloak. Taking a key from his belt he opened the door to the warehouse, went in and bade me follow. A whiff of musty spice reached me as I stepped in, as well as a hint of overripe fruit\u2014the former contents of the house, not quite overcome by the smell of paint.\nAnd there was the painting. I had expected some small piece of canvas, but there it hung from the rafters, huge. Ilios must have needed a ladder to reach the top\u2014and indeed one stood leaning against the wall. I had seen some great pictures, but this was larger than all of them, filling all my sight, and in the gloom of the warehouse it was dark, indiscernible.\nIlios came up behind me.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pressing a little purse, fat with coin, into my hands. \u201cFor coming.\u201d As I opened my mouth to protest he added, \u201cI would hate to owe you anything. Stay here; I\u2019ll open the doors so you\u2019ll see better.\u201d\nClack, clack went the window shutters and the doors even as he moved soundlessly between them, a mere shadow; with each clack a portion of the painting was revealed, clearer and clearer.\nTars floated out to me. Out of the night and into a clear, soft sunrise it came. For the most part it was dark, hiding the rising sun, but light was spreading across the calm, still sea, and limned the city\u2019s tall towers and parapets. Yet night lingered also, shadows and mist.\nHe had painted his island large and with many details, but for a few moments I was overwhelmed by the general impression. At first I could see no man or woman in the painting, but then there were small, smudged silhouettes in the shadows. A few only, and for the most part the city seemed asleep . . . and yet there was life in it, I knew, from the tiny, bright flag that flapped in the breeze on top of a tower, and the few lit windows, and the risen dust in the streets.\n* * *\nHe tugged at my sleeve\u2014I must have stood for a long while, silent, gaping.\n\u201cCould you do it?\u201d\nHis voice echoed through the warehouse. And I, who had been a frequent quack and counterfeiter for so many years, felt the best, most honest, silliest impulse: I truly wanted to make it come true.\nIn the following weeks, I unearthed my former master\u2019s hoard of crumbling codices, and spent hours poring over them, inhaling dust and fragments of old paper. I looked for elixirs and spells, things I would normally have scoffed at, but which I was willing to try for the sake of this bright, disappeared island and its orphan, its maker. And yet there was so little. Oh, there were spells: spells for the restoration of lost (missed, needed, loved) things\u2014by which, unfortunately, paltry items were meant, keys and coins and tools. . . . Spells to defy death. Spells for rising out of water. Spells for the creation of images, and spells for making dreams come true. Spells by which disease drawn on paper might become disease striking. So many spells and so many tricks to fulfil a thousand yearnings\u2014and not one powerful enough for my purpose. But I kept searching.\nCombining those spells was hard and uncertain work. I had little trust in our chances, or, come to think of it, my abilities; for many years I had found it too easy to resort to sleight of hand and tricks of light. All at once I was required to have faith.\nI can\u2019t quite recall how I came upon the precious combination. I was not thinking anymore, having foregone method for chance. I was then working in one corner of the warehouse, as far away from Ilios as possible, so that we would not disturb one another. I had set one of his paintings (a preliminary study of some dull, dead-eyed duke\u2019s son) on an easel, between two candles set close enough to light the surface of the picture with a shifting brilliance, but far enough not to stain it with soot as well. Then I had gone on to work the spell, drawing lines in chalk, putting semiprecious stones here and there, sprinkling spicy, exotic powders. I even used a smear of some fantastical creature\u2019s blood: phoenix or griffin, elephant or crocodile\u2014or possibly lizard, rat, or hen.\nI had circled the painting several times. Now I came back to the front, hunched still to look at my work, and, at the upper limit of my sight, caught a glimpse of white. Slowly, I drew myself up. A drop of sweat snaked down my spine, beneath wool.\nBefore my eyes the painting shone greenly, and a silhouette rose: pale, unbreathing. Almost but not quite still, as if caught in slow, slow time. A trailing sleeve fluttered in an unfelt breeze, but moved as if in water, and shifted like a drowned thing. With each moment the silhouette seemed to grow more solid and more thick, and then withdrew, paling and fading into darkness again.\nIt had lasted for a minute or an hour. It had not made a sound, nor had I. Ilios had carried on with his painting, unaware. I wiped my sweaty brow, and quietened my fast beating heart. It had stared with oily eyes.\nI had done what I was expected to do. Paid to do. What Ilios wanted. And yet I felt no sense of accomplishment. What I had imagined? Sparkling light and life, congratulations? That night I did not speak to Ilios of my discovery but went to bed, and dreamt of that silent, painted man, who stared with living eyes. I had never achieved so much, and dreaded to think too much; I did not believe, and yet by then my life had acquired the fluid, treacherous consistency of a dream, where one thing may be held true, and in the same instant, not so. . . .\nAnd there was nothing else for it: the following night, I called Ilios to my corner of the warehouse, having previously requested another painting (I did not want to see the man again\u2014not alive, not painted, not brought to this artificial life\u2014and besides, a veil of something like smoke had marred it after all) and drawn most of the spell already. I said nothing; he stood in front of the picture while I put the finishing touches.\nFrom his sharply drawn breath I knew the spell had worked. Moving quickly toward him, I saw what had made him gasp: the woman he had painted, standing before him. Behind her, on the painting, a livid brilliance crept. I did not know who she was, what chambermaid or noblewoman had let herself be painted, if indeed she bore any resemblance to her model or was only Ilios\u2019s creation\u2014and mine! This time I noticed more: the slickness of her cheek, the unformed mass of shining brown that was her hair. Ilios had only painted her from the lap up, and so from there down she was only an approximation of being, trailing off to the floor. But with every minute she grew more solid, under her painter\u2019s gaze. I did not hear him breathe; he stood still and clenched, and so did I, and so did she.\nThen, slowly, she lifted her head, and looked at him. Met his gaze, I think. And she walked forward, and though her eyes did not leave Ilios, she raised her hand, and dipped her fingers into the flame of a candle, and pinched the wick.\nIn the semidarkness Ilios gasped again, and stumbled forward. She was only half a thing, and then, as Ilios\u2019s feet undid the designs I had wrought, she vanished.\nAfter a while I lit the candle again. The painting, like the one before, seemed veiled by soot. Ilios sat on the floor, breathing hard, sallow faced. I helped him up and led him away, towards his own painting of Tars and a chair into which he sank gratefully. For a long moment he sat with his head in his hands.\nWhen he raised his face again he seemed shaken still, and yet appeared to be recovering his calm more rapidly than I had expected.\n\u201cShe was real, was she not?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe put out the candle.\u201d\nI thought of the smudge of soot on her fingers, and the thin shell of wax that had adhered to her fingertips, and fluttered to the floor as she vanished. Yes, I said to myself, she was real, after a fashion; and yet you only make yourself a city of ghosts. But I had pledged to aid him.\n\u201cI think she was,\u201d I merely said.\n\u201cThis is good,\u201d he said, nodding to me. \u201cWell done.\u201d\nI bowed my head.\n\u201cI did not think\u2014\u201d He paused, and stared ahead, and took a deep breath. \u201cI did not believe it would work. Somehow I had no hope.\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\nPerhaps he thought I answered merely out of politeness. But I did understand, though he had previously displayed no sign of lacking faith.\n\u201cWill you be able to do this again?\u201d he asked. There was a new, fixed brightness in his eyes.\n\u201cI think so.\u201d (Did I? Did I? Not a single man or woman but an entire land? Was he already infecting me with his sick faith again, his insincere, desperate hope?)\n\u201cGood.\u201d Once again he nodded, wearily.\nWe parted soon after, and I went to my apartments and there spent another uneasy night.\nI set out to work. But I did it slowly. Ilios reluctantly agreed to let me try more before embarking on our final, great endeavour. But it was necessary, I thought, and he had to agree, for the ghosts I had made him lasted but for a short time. So I made him new ones, each time with a shudder of dread, and made my spell stronger, clearer. And each time they remained longer, and in Ilios\u2019s absence (I had not dared make him come) they roamed the room, caring nothing for me, real and silent and terrible.\nI also had to replenish my supplies, making my way through the city\u2019s seediest markets in search of esoteric materials, paying with Ilios\u2019s coin. But at last I was ready, and for three days worked almost continuously, while Ilios fretted, went drinking, and came back soon after, moaning and trembling (he was as ill-equipped for drunkenness as he was desperate to be drunk), stayed slumped in an old armchair, eyes glazed, hands twitching with nervousness.\nThen it was done\u2014almost done. I roused Ilios from his stupor, and he went to stand in front of his painting, looking ill. Under his gaze I set the last stones in my design, the design I had found, perfected, before which I had sweated and shuddered.\nNothing happened. Ilios, not knowing that I had finished, said nothing for a while, until he noticed my perplexity.\n\u201cIt did not work, did it?\u201d he said, sourly. If he had looked ill before he looked sicker now, and yet relieved as well. He turned to face the darkness, leaving me to stare at his bowed, shaking shoulders.\n\u201cPerhaps it did,\u201d I said. \u201cWe would not know until. . . .\u201d\nBut he turned again and shook his head.\n\u201cWe would have known,\u201d he said. Had we not been witness to that sickly, creeping brightness before the dimming, on the other paintings? It had not occurred there. Ilios, staggering in either anger or despair, left, and I did too. But he came back, and so did I, and without a word we set out again. He painted with trembling hands now, but they stilled as soon as his brush touched the canvas.\nBut whatever we lacked I could not find. Something eluded us, and as time went by and I checked my pattern again and again I could not believe it was insignificant, a simple omission; no, whatever eluded us must be crucial. I think he knew it too. I think his hands trembled because of that, not the wine he was imbibing. I watched him, fingers and cheek and hair daubed with paint, fumbling with his brushes, his palette, his knives.\nUp on his ladder he clenched a knife sticky with dark red paint, and applied himself to his painting. He had used it to paint, and now scraped back a small, unsatisfactory portion of his picture; he kept his palette knives sharp for precisely that purpose. But he shook, and wounded himself. It must have been a deep cut, because blood welled up immediately on his hand. With a muffled curse he let the knife drop.\nIt fell to the floor with clatter and all at once the painting was lit with that accursed brilliance. It flared up and disappeared at once. On the floor the red paint, mingled with his blood, smoked. Ilios looked on, ashen. Immediately we knew, as we perhaps always had, what had been lacking, and must be given up.\nHe said nothing, and nor did I. But we both knew. We were not surprised when two or three days later reports came of fishermen surprised by a glow on the still sea, a nightly mirage, a silent ship of shadows and sunrise, so large it might have been an island. Yet Ilios when he heard grabbed his head with both hands and sat, curled and clenched and inconsolable, on an old stool. He did not ask me anything. I think he wept.\nFor three days I did not see him. The warehouse was locked, its shutters drawn. I knocked and prowled for a few hours, not even knowing whether he was inside or not. I went to his apartments, but he was nowhere to be found. I did not dare enter the warehouse, dreading what I might find there. I feared for him. Thought he might have sacrificed himself, perhaps. Been overcome by despair. Was he not a weak, slender, shy thing, with a poor head for wine, and tears, and trembling hands? And enough grief to kill a man? And yet he had survived his great disaster.\nOn the fourth day I gritted my teeth and went to the warehouse. It was early still, before dawn on a winter\u2019s day; I had risen only a few hours after going to bed, and found myself unable to go back to sleep. The warehouse stood at the corner of two empty streets, dark against a sky that was barely lighter; with its high, steep sloping roof and wooden sides, it looked almost like the hull of a great ship, waiting in the night.\nI went to the door and tried to open it, without much hope, thinking it locked, as it had been for the past three days. But the high wooden door swung back before my touch and, as I stepped into the dark, closed soundlessly behind me, and on the dusty floor a triangle of grey light diminished and vanished. In the dark there was a rustle and a murmur: I am sorry.\nI think he truly was: sorry and angry, desperate and desperate to live, too. The knife ripped my coat, my doublet, and grazed my ribs. Pain shot through my side, but at once I was moving, trying to wrestle the knife from his hands. We struggled blindly, and poorly: he felt too guilty, I think, though determined, and however enraged I was then, I must have faintly hoped that perhaps he was only under a temporary fit of madness. I grabbed the wrist of the hand that held the knife, and he kicked me; I grasped his curls and he writhed, hissed, wept, bit, punched.\nFor a moment we were apart. I heard his breathing and the sound of him, moving blindly. And I could feel his closeness, his breath warm against my cheek. Then, we were fighting again\u2014for how long, I do not know. I was stronger, but he was not afraid\u2014not of me.\nThen he was silent and still, and so was I. I arose, pained, and groped my way to the shutters; I opened one and turned. He was lying on his back, close to his painting. Blood was seeping from him, from a wound I\u2014I think it was I\u2014had given him. He was ashen already, his lips bloodless, growing more colourless by the second. He said nothing, looked at me.\nI went to him, and turned him towards his painting, his island, which the creeping dawn slowly, slowly lit. Without saying a word, merely looking, he died.\nI wrapped him in his painting when he was gone. I wonder, now, if red paint alone would not have done the trick, better than blood. A mockery of blood for a mockery of truth.\n* * *\nAnd so he told his story, again and again, farther and farther from the Inner Sea, in lands where they had never heard of Tars, where they thought him mad, or lying, an inventor of tales.

Byrne","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"The red palace was home to a thousand cats. Or so people said. Princess Cosima, twenty, beautiful, and bored, walked through the courtyards until she saw a lithe, sandy female sunning itself on the flagstones. She slipped into the cat\u2019s mind and sent it prowling across the square, scrambling up the red stone wall onto a tiled canopy and darting over the battlements above toward the nearest tower.\nCosima followed at ground level, keeping her footsteps calm and measured as befitted a princess. She strolled between the orange trees and marble columns, silk slippers padding cat-soft on the warm stones, her long hair and the gossamer layers of her dress fluttering in the breeze.\nThrough the cat\u2019s eyes, she saw the sandy expanse of the plains. The invading army massed there, rank and file midway through shifting into fragmented disorder. Far above the scented gardens, her cat-nose caught the smell of smoke and blood and dying.\nOnly her cat-self knew about these things: the blood and the smoke and the overwhelming numbers. It wasn\u2019t thought necessary for a princess to be told such military details. We\u2019re winning, her royal husband said, of course we\u2019re winning (you silly girl). Don\u2019t be afraid, princess, the guards reassured her, though that wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d asked, you\u2019re perfectly safe here. Shiyam was different, but, well, they had other things but war on their minds when they were together. Only the cat-eyes showed her truth.\nShe saw the vast deep blue of the sky, a startling flash of colour in the grey cat-world. Seabirds wheeling white in the sunlight, the rocky mountainside falling away toward the sea, waves breaking over and over on the shore. Far out toward the hazy horizon, ships guarded the bay, their white sails emblazoned with her husband\u2019s insignia. But then. . . .\nCosima stopped. Her cat-eyes stared, silent. Her girl-eyes blinked. There were dozens of figures, swarming up the steep winding paths from the hidden beach down there. Sunlight glinted on spear tips.\nShe let the cat come leaping back down from its high vantage point, landing lightly on one rooftop and then the next as it made its way down toward her. The cat stopped, poised on the edge of the scalloped roof tiles, and stared down at her. For a moment her cat-self looked at her girl-self, and then with an easy flick of her mind she let the cat go.\nThe transition made her momentarily dizzy, and she sat down quickly by the edge of the fountain, closing her eyes.\n\u201cHey, princess girl? You\u2019re all right?\u201d\nCosima opened her eyes and looked up at the tall woman standing over her, black armoured, spear slinging, half-concerned smile, half-ironic quirked eyebrow, tough and tender all at once. Shiyam.\n\u201cI . . . I\u2019m fine,\u201d Cosima managed after a moment of disorientation.\n\u201cYou sure? You look like you\u2019ve had too much sun.\u201d With Shiyam\u2019s strong, steadying hand on her bare arm, Cosima tried to shake off the indolent cat-ness, her acute awareness of the smell of the purple bougainvillea spilling over the wall, the scent of Shiyam\u2019s leather and warm skin as the guard sat down next to her. There was something important she had to say.\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming from the other way,\u201d she said at last. \u201cFrom the sea side. Does anyone know?\u201d\nShiyam looked at her, startled, a half-smile lingering on her lips.\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d The smile faded into a puzzled look. \u201cHow would you know a thing like that?\u201d\n\u201cI just do.\u201d Cosima looked into her dark eyes. \u201cPlease, believe me.\u201d\nShiyam frowned.\n\u201cNot likely they\u2019d have got past our ships. And there\u2019s supposed to be a watchman on that back gate. But it\u2019s lightly guarded. . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look right to me,\u201d Cosima insisted.\n\u201cI\u2019ll check it out,\u201d Shiyam said. \u201cI was headed that way anyway.\u201d She got up, glanced back over her shoulder to make sure no one was looking, and kissed the tips of her fingers.\n\u201cFind some shade, sweet girl. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n* * *\nCosima waited.\nWaiting was what a princess did. You waited out your girlhood years for your marriageable age to come, all those frantic years when summer stretched before you like a lifetime. Waited for your royal husband to require your duties, then waited, with your body performing the practiced moves and sounds, until he was satisfied and slept. Waited through interminable ceremonies and banquets and audiences; guests, priests, dignitaries, supplicants, all parading past the face you\u2019d carefully arranged for the occasion.\nWaited, sometimes, for your handsome guard to come off patrol duty, stride down from the battlements with her skin salty and dark curls still warm from the sun, and sweep you off your silk-slippered feet in your chamber, all satin sheets and soft candlelit ripples in the bathing pool and whispers of something like love because it can\u2019t be treason without a man. But mostly you just waited, until your mind started climbing the walls. A siege didn\u2019t make so much difference to a princess\u2019s life.\nCats did waiting better; the little sandy one was already curled asleep on the red-gold roof tiles. Cosima got up and paced around the little tree-lined square, trailed her fingers through the clear water of the fountain, stared up toward the towers again, the distant circling of the seabirds. She thought about reaching for the cat again. Thought about reaching for one of those birds, she\u2019d never done that before, it had always been her languid cat companions. So far away, though. She didn\u2019t know where to begin.\nThen a crash of splintering wood, splitting the quiet air, distant shouting, running footsteps. Cosima jerked to her feet, her heartbeat suddenly thudding against her ribs, such an alien sensation it took her a moment to realise what it was. Then the clash of steel on wood. She froze as an arrow glanced off the pillar next to her, clattering on the tiles.\n\u201cPrincess!\u201d Shiyam came running back down the path, two more arrows stuck in the leather backplate of her armor. \u201cGet down, now, get down!\u201d\nCosima stared at her dumbly, unable to move, and then Shiyam slammed into her, tumbling her to the ground. The impact knocked the breath out of her, even with Shiyam\u2019s arms wrapped around her. She didn\u2019t see the last arrow hit. Only felt its tip graze her hair, gentle as a breeze, heard Shiyam\u2019s soft little grunt of pain, felt the warm blood spilling over her cheek, welling in her ear.\n\u201cWait here, princess, sweet,\u201d Shiyam said, her voice distant and drowsy, like she was drifting into sleep. \u201cStay here, safe.\u201d\nCosima didn\u2019t know if Shiyam meant now, or if her mind was drifting back to their last conversation, but she stayed obediently still. She didn\u2019t know what else to do.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Shiyam whispered, a breath soft as down against her ear, and then she didn\u2019t say any more.\nCosima was drenched in her blood, sticky all down the side of her face and matted in her hair. Twisting her head around, she could see the shaft of the arrow, thrust right through Shiyam\u2019s neck, between her armor and helmet.\nCosima waited. She lost track of the minutes and the hours that passed, and she couldn\u2019t see what was happening in the palace except that death and chaos had come. The sun rose high and began to sink again. Shiyam\u2019s weight was still and crushing on her, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could move her. Wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to. But the palace was home to a thousand cats, or near enough. Reaching out, she found one.\n* * *\nThe red stones were all shades of grey in the cat\u2019s eyes, and the pools and rivers of blood were slickly black. The bodies of palace guards lay everywhere, pincushioned with arrows, run through with spears. And not just guards. The cat paused to nose at the body of the kitchen girl who\u2019d given her fish bones just this morning, started to lick at the spilling mess of her belly before Cosima made her move on. The back gate (lightly guarded) was kicked and hacked into splinters, the great front gates unbarred and flung open from the inside now. Outside on the plains the army surged slow and distant toward the devastated palace, while inside enemy soldiers stalked the squares and colonnades, searching for survivors. The cat trailed after a group of them heading down toward the orange garden.\nNo, not there, her girl-self pleaded, the scent of oranges and bougainvillea mingling with the iron-salt blood taste in her every breath. The cat mewed, and one of the guards glanced her way but paid no notice. Cosima made the cat spring forward, claws out, raking at the man\u2019s booted leg. He glanced down, aimed a casual kick at the cat. Its little body slammed into the wall with a sickening crunch, and Cosima flinched away from the pain and shrank back into her girl-body.\nThe men advanced on her, their footsteps all around. One of them leaned over her, so close she could feel his breath hot on her face. She lay still as Shiyam was, her eyes shut and gummed with drying blood, but she couldn\u2019t keep from breathing.\n\u201cThis one\u2019s alive,\u201d the man said, and her heart sank. She felt them haul Shiyam\u2019s dead weight off her, knew what they saw: the fine silk, blue-gold, the silver, the jewels strung in her blood-matted hair. The royal insignia on the guard dead protecting her. They\u2019ll never let me go. . . .\nCosima opened her eyes, stared up at the man crouching over her. Instinctively she tried to reach for his mind, felt him yield for a moment then, startled, push her violently back. She tried again, reaching for any of them in panic, all of them, she couldn\u2019t focus, couldn\u2019t do it. Shiyam, help me, she thought. Help me. And then. She slipped into Shiyam\u2019s mind.\nIt was dark. It was nothing like the cats, just echoing trapping screaming darkness, and her princess-body lay shaking with horror on the ground and her mind reaching, running, searching. And then, there.\nThere was a little of Shiyam left. Just a spark, and Cosima reached for it, and then her Shiyam-eyes flicked open, her Shiyam-self was rising to her feet.\nShe was taller, the perspective almost made her lose her balance, and the weight of the armor was shocking, but she knew she was strong. The men were reaching for weapons, the one on the ground scrambling away from her but not fast enough, and her booted foot slammed into him, hurling him back. Shiyam\u2019s spear swung around in her hand with practiced ease. She covered her Cosima-eyes with her hand, rolling over away from the horror. But her Shiyam-eyes were steady and her aim was true and the sharpened spear point found vengeance in the man\u2019s throat, jamming up under his chin and out through his mouth. The other men were backing away.\nCosima stared up at Shiyam. The arrow had broken off and fallen to the ground, leaving the wound in her neck open and ragged. Her dark skin looked pale, drained, and her eyes . . . she turned those terrible eyes on the men, and they ran.\nShiyam yanked her spear free of the body on the ground and held out her hand to Cosima. She looked down at the frightened princess shivering in her blood-soaked dress. She looked up at the tall, strong guard with the dead eyes. For a moment Cosima didn\u2019t know who she was. Then she reached up, grabbed Shiyam\u2019s hand, and pulled herself to her feet. Remembering the army outside the gates, she reached out farther, and then all over the palace the black-armoured guards were rising and reaching for weapons. The invaders fled.\n* * *\nCosima waited. Outside on the plains, a king waited, and his army regrouped and waited with him. Cosima heard the call of their horns splitting the cooling air, the herald\u2019s voices crying out to her, but she did not go, and they would not come while death walked the palace. Cosima set her guards to watch the gates and man the battlements, sent a cat up to the tower roof again to inspect the carnage on the plains.\nThe ships out in the bay were burning, bright lines of fire on the darkening horizon. There were still no enemy ships in sight. Or are there? As the sun slanted over the water, she glimpsed the shape of them through cat-eyes, like ghost ships, just for a moment before they turned against the light and vanished again. Invisible ships? Cosima sent extra guards to the watch at the coastside gate. Then she walked the palace.\nThey were all dead, every last one. Her royal husband as well, in his bedchamber with a half-clothed servant girl sprawled over his lap. Cosima managed a faint smile at that, because otherwise she would have wept. She could hardly blame him, after all. She wondered if she could reach for him, for any of them, all of them. . . .\n\u201cLet them rest,\u201d Shiyam said in her head, making her jump. She looked around and saw the guard woman standing silently in the doorway, watching her.\nHow does that work? Cosima wondered. I thought I was in your head, not you in mine. She pressed her fingers to her temples where her head was starting to ache.\nShe was thirsty, and she hauled water from the well herself, the crank handle blistering her soft hands, and drank deep. She went down to the kitchens, where flies buzzed around half-prepared dishes on the tables and stiffening corpses on the floor; despite the horror she was starving, and she picked hungrily at the meat and fruit and bread. Then she waited some more. Even the stones of the palace seemed to wait.\nAt dusk Cosima went through the wooden gate, through the meadow where wildflowers bobbed their night-closed heads in her wake, and up the hill to the elm wood, shady dark and foreign as she was here. She sat down between the sprawling roots of the largest tree, leaned her back against its solid, smooth-cobbled trunk.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she said. \u201cSo tired.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to stop,\u201d the tree said. \u201cYou know that. You have to let them go sometime.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Cosima said. She closed her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t. I need them.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to,\u201d the tree said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way life works, everything dies, it goes into the earth, it rots, breaks down, rich and dark, it feeds our roots. . . .\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t feed on Shiyam,\u201d Cosima insisted. \u201cShe\u2019s not dead. She talks to me. In my head, she talks to me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d the tree said. \u201cThey\u2019re all you. Why do you think you feel so tired, spread so thin?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you, then?\u201d Cosima asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you just me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d the tree asked.\nCosima stared up through its leaves at the patterns the stars made. Somewhere in the darkness, a nightingale sang.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered.\nThe tree let a slender branch sway gently in the night breeze and brush Cosima\u2019s cheek softly with the tip of a leaf. She slept.\n* * *\nAs the sun came up on the second day, Cosima rose from where she\u2019d slept under the elm to find her body refreshed and her dead still watching.\nYou\u2019d think they\u2019d smell bad by now. They didn\u2019t. Just salty, like blood or the sea, though they stood their posts as silent as the grave. Cosima shook off the damp and stiffness along with the leaves and twigs that clung to her, and went down to the palace.\nIn her bedchamber she stripped off the blue-gold gown and left it where it fell on the tiled floor. She climbed into the bathing pool and washed Shiyam\u2019s blood from her skin, awkwardly without a handmaiden to help her, slid down to submerge her hair. When she was done, the water swirled red.\nCosima perfumed her neck and wrists, dressed herself in purest white, and, calling Shiyam to her side, walked out into the sunlight.\nThe king sat his horse before the gates, his heavily armoured guards all around him, the still-overwhelming ranks of his army massed at his back. His queen consort was beside him, tall and straight-backed in the saddle, with her red hair piled up in an elaborate style. Her face was arranged in a still, dispassionate expression.\n\u201cThat one is dangerous,\u201d Shiyam said in her mind, as both their sets of eyes looked back at the queen.\n\u201cPrincesa,\u201d the king\u2019s herald cried out. \u201cWill you yield?\u201d\nCosima stood perfectly still at the top of the great stone steps, said nothing. Shiyam was a dark, silent presence at her shoulder.\n\u201cPrincesa, your cities are occupied, your armies defeated, your royal husband dead. Your old-man king across the sea surrenders the land. Stand down now, and your life will be spared.\u201d\n\u201cMy life isn\u2019t yours to spare,\u201d Cosima shouted back, her voice nearly swept away by the wind. She pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cMy guards protect me.\u201d\nThe group of leaders conferred briefly, and then it was the red-haired queen who rode forward, urging her horse right up to the foot of the steps below where Cosima stood. The horse shied away at the sight of Shiyam, but the queen kept her seat effortlessly, soothed the animal with a touch of her hand on its neck.\n\u201cWill you send your dead away, princess?\u201d she asked. Her voice was deep and warm like honey. Cosima licked her lips.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\nThe queen smiled.\n\u201cCome now. They\u2019re frightening my horses. And my men.\u201d\nCosima shook her head, feeling suddenly silly under the older woman\u2019s steady, amused gaze.\nThe queen slid her leg over the saddle in a flurry of skirts, jumped down lightly to the ground. She let go of the reins, and her horse turned and bolted back to the ranks, where a guardsman ran to catch it. The queen paid no attention to the commotion behind her. She started to walk up the steps.\n\u201cIsabela!\u201d the king called out in alarm, though he didn\u2019t move. Some of the guardsmen shuffled their horses forward with nervous glances at their king, but a few steps only; they would go no farther. The queen Isabela smiled and kept walking.\nShiyam took a step to stand protectively in front of her princess, gripping her spear across her body. At Cosima\u2019s feet, a little cat arched its back and hissed. Isabela glanced down at it as she came to the top of the steps, raised an eyebrow. She made a calming gesture with her hand, and the cat quietened like the horse had, sat down with its tail curled around its body.\nIsabela walked right up to Shiyam. The queen wasn\u2019t nearly as tall as she\u2019d seemed; the imposing guard woman towered over her. But Isabela put her fingertips lightly on the spear shaft.\n\u201cStand aside, brave one,\u201d she said with quiet respect. \u201cI mean your princess no harm.\u201d Then with no more than her fingertips she moved Shiyam firmly aside, and looked Cosima in the eye.\n\u201cThere, now, that\u2019s the real you.\u201d Her calm blue eyes looked into Cosima\u2019s soul. \u201cNow, hasn\u2019t there been enough fighting here? Enough blood on these stones and this sand? Enough dying to last us all a lifetime?\u201d\nCosima squeezed her eyes shut, feeling the hot tears stinging there.\n\u201cI won\u2019t send them away,\u201d she insisted, and she knew her voice sounded like a petulant little girl\u2019s. A tear welled over her eyelid. They\u2019re mine. They\u2019re all I\u2019ve got left.\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Isabela said. She reached up, gently wiped away the tear sliding down Cosima\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe can build stables for the horses outside your gates. The men,\u201d she glanced over her shoulder, \u201cwill just have to get used to the arrangement.\u201d\n* * *\nThe red palace was home to the living and the dead, and as many cats as ever. Sandy, tabby, black-white, and tortoiseshell, they roamed and hunted and snoozed like always, unperturbed by the corpses that walked, as indifferent to the undead as they were to the living.\nIt wasn\u2019t just the men who were afraid. Isabela had brought her full entourage of handmaidens, plus enough servants to staff the kitchens and laundries and gardens; enough also to haul away the hundreds of bodies to their watery burial, to scrub an ocean of blood from stone steps and marble floors, or at least cover the stains with carpets or rushes, though the cats were never fooled.\n\u201cWhy did you kill everyone?\u201d Cosima asked one day in what used to be the prince\u2019s suite. \u201cLike the kitchen girls and the old man who picks the oranges, what did they ever do to hurt anyone?\u201d\nIsabela didn\u2019t glance up from the papers she was flicking through at the big hardwood desk. The king was away, fighting a minor war in one of the border principalities. The queen ruled the red palace and its lands.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do to have people spreading tales, fuelling dissent, creating bad feeling,\u201d Isabela said. \u201cIt\u2019s cleaner this way.\u201d\nCosima nearly choked, thinking of the maid with the cat nibbling her guts.\nIsabela sighed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so young. You have to understand what we are trying to achieve, the king and I. A unified land. No more wars, no tribes and factions fighting each other, endless border disputes. Now, isn\u2019t this way so much better?\u201d\nCosima hesitated, struggling to think of an argument against that.\n\u201cThere will be no difficulty in finding you another husband,\u201d Isabela went on. \u201cI\u2019ll marry you to my second son, if you like.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want another husband,\u201d Cosima said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want the first one.\u201d\nIsabela looked up at last, meeting her eyes.\n\u201cI was betrothed at six,\u201d she said. \u201cThat ended when two kings went to war. They tried to marry me again at fourteen, but the old man died on his way to meet me. I\u2019ll spare you the details of the others, but in the end, it was my dear cousin just as I\u2019d known from the start, the perfect alliance.\u201d Her smile was delicate, perfectly arranged. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it, how things work out.\u201d\nCosima shivered slightly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Isabela said, turning back to her papers. \u201cYou needn\u2019t be married or bred if you don\u2019t wish it.\u201d She paused before dipping her pen delicately in the black ink again. \u201cI may have another use for your talents, princess.\u201d\n* * *\nCosima strolled through the palace gardens by day, sliding briefly out of habit into the furtive presences of cats now and then, aware of Shiyam\u2019s footsteps behind her. She was a captive, according to the official terms of the surrender, though it seemed unlikely the old king in exile would ever stir himself to ransom her, and she had the freedom to roam the palace as ever before, none daring to lay a hand on her while her dead guards stood watch. It was getting easier to be all of them, less tiring, even with a cat or two added to the mix. With little effort she could slip a little more into one or another of their existences as she chose. She could even pull a little of them into her own mind, let what spark remained of their beings walk in her princess-body and look through her eyes.\nAt night she slept in her old bedchamber as though nothing had changed. Shiyam stood guard at her door, needing no sleep. They\u2019d tried, once, to pretend everything was the same as before\u2014Cosima\u2019s fingers fumbling at the buckles of Shiyam\u2019s armor, her own silk gown slipping off her shoulders\u2014but the chill of the other woman\u2019s touch had made her shiver, and she\u2019d stopped.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d Shiyam had said in her head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the same.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cosima had agreed. But I miss you.\nAs the days passed, the weeks, the months, the sun rose lower in the sky and leaves started to drop from the trees, skittering across the courtyards like the running of tiny feet. Cosima looked toward the mountains, snow-peaked, and thought of her childhood home far away. And she waited.\nThen one night, after sunset and before moonrise, Isabela called Cosima to her private chambers.\n\u201cI know a man,\u201d Isabela said softly, over tiny cups of steaming tea, \u201cwho says he knows of a new world, that he\u2019s designing a ship like no other that can sail there. He wants my support, my gold to fund his voyage.\u201d\nCosima cradled her cup, watched the other woman expectantly.\n\u201cMy advisors say the idea is ridiculous.\u201d Isabela glanced up suddenly. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Cosima blinked. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t think anything.\u201d\nIsabela laughed.\n\u201cNo. You haven\u2019t been encouraged to, have you?\u201d She patted Cosima gently on the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t be affronted, child. I know how princesses are raised and trained, and no one can blame a girl for being what the world made her. But the world is changing, little princess. So tell me, what do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think,\u201d Cosima said after a moment, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t believe everything a man tells you. Especially when they want something from you.\u201d\nIsabela raised an amused eyebrow. \u201cIndeed.\u201d She stood. \u201cBut come, let me show you something.\u201d\nOutside the air was growing cool and damp, the white moonflowers blooming fragrant in the dark. Isabela took Cosima by the arm in sisterly fashion and led her along the winding paths of the rose gardens, pausing there to look up into the clear sky.\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d she asked.\nCosima stared upward.\n\u201cThe stars,\u201d she said. \u201cThe constellations, I don\u2019t know, darkness. Nothing.\u201d\nThey walked on, up the spiral of stone steps to the observing tower. Cosima had never been up there before, never seen the intricate telescopes and timepieces and star maps arrayed under the glass dome. Isabela made her sit down before the largest telescope, showed her where to look. The dim light of the candle flickered on copper and glass.\n\u201cThere, you see it?\u201d Isabela asked.\nCosima peered through the lens, squinting one eye shut, stared at the sky.\n\u201cThe red star?\u201d She\u2019d seen that one before, but not as close as it was through the glass, crimson glow against the black sky.\n\u201cThe red world,\u201d Isabela said. \u201cHe says it\u2019s rich with rubies, red gold, and spices. Perhaps it is. Why else would it be so red?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s all red fire, burning like the sun,\u201d Cosima suggested.\n\u201cYou would think so. Though he says not, he says it\u2019s cold enough to freeze the bones.\u201d\n\u201cHow does he know?\u201d Cosima wondered.\n\u201cHe has instruments, calculations.\u201d Isabela shrugged. \u201cHe says none can walk there and live. So cold and no air to breathe.\u201d\n\u201cMy guards don\u2019t need air to breathe,\u201d Cosima said, the words tumbling out thoughtlessly. She stopped, looked at Isabela. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Isabela said. She put a hand over Cosima\u2019s, her touch warm and firm.\n\u201cThink on it, princess. This is no place for them.\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Cosima said. She pulled her hand free. \u201cI told you, I won\u2019t send them away.\u201d\nIsabela just nodded.\n\u201cThe moon\u2019s coming up,\u201d she said lightly. She snapped the metal lid over the telescope\u2019s lens. \u201cWe\u2019ll see no more tonight. Go on, go to your bed now. It\u2019s late.\u201d\nCosima went. She hesitated a moment, glanced back at the top of the steps to see Isabela staring out at the moonrise, as though she\u2019d forgotten her, as though she\u2019d forgotten anyone else existed in the world.\n* * *\n\u201cShe\u2019s seducing you,\u201d Shiyam said in Cosima\u2019s head as she lay awake in her chamber. \u201cSecrets under the stars, midnight in the rose garden, she knows her way around you all right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Cosima sat up. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. She\u2019s old enough to be my mother.\u201d\n\u201cNot like that,\u201d Shiyam said. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s seducing your mind. Making you believe in her, winning your trust. The motherly thing\u2019s all part of it. You miss your mama, don\u2019t you, wish she was here sometimes?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s dead. Has been for years, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Shiyam said. \u201cDead\u2019s not what it used to be.\u201d\nCosima lay down again, closed her eyes. But there was still moonshine through the open window, and burned on the surface of her mind was the deep red of that distant world.\n* * *\nCosima hadn\u2019t left the palace in two years, not since she was married. The sky seemed vast without the red walls to enclose her, and she stared around in mixed wonder and alarm as they made their way down the steps cut into the face of the cliff, down toward the seashore.\nStay here, safe\u2014she remembered Shiyam\u2019s last real words to her The guard woman stood at the top of the cliff, watching, waiting.\nCosima only glanced back at her once before she followed Isabela down onto the beach, where a man of middle years waited, dressed in plain black.\nHe bowed to Isabela and said, \u201cMy queen,\u201d then turned to Cosima.\n\u201cPrincipessa,\u201d he said to her, simply, in her own language. Cosima hadn\u2019t heard that word since her wedding day, since her mother kissed her goodbye, and for a moment she could almost smell the pine trees. \u201cThis way.\u201d\nThe man led them around the corner to a hidden cove, their footsteps sinking into the damp sand.\n\u201cThere,\u201d he said, gesturing. Cosima looked.\nIt was a ship, but like no other she had ever seen. Its hull was near-spherical, half black and shining, half clear as glass, like an enormous bubble bobbing on the waves. The sails shimmered like silver, triangular, fanning out in a vast sevenfold array angled over the water.\n\u201cHow does it work?\u201d Cosima asked in wonder.\n\u201cPrincipessa, you would not comprehend. . . .\u201d\n\u201cTry,\u201d she said.\nHe gestured toward the pale sky.\n\u201cMidwinter is coming, and every day our world is flying faster past the sun. And if at sunset on the shortest day this ship is running west with her sails full, then, princess, she will fly over the edge of the sea, the edge of the world, and sail into the void beyond. Then the heavenly breezes will speed her on her way to the red world.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Cosima said.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I make the invisible ships that stormed your red castle?\u201d he asked. \u201cNine parts mirrors, and one part magic. And you\u2019re one to talk about what\u2019s possible, Cosima of the dead.\u201d\nIs that what people are calling me?\n\u201cIs this ship one part magic?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNine and ninety parts,\u201d he replied with a smile. \u201cAnd the other part the metals and minerals courtesy of your good queen\u2019s generosity.\u201d\nShe isn\u2019t my queen, Cosima thought. She shouldn\u2019t be yours either. Bought and sold. But aren\u2019t we all?\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said, then turned her back on the wondrous ship and made her way back up the beach toward the palace.\n* * *\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said to the tree, later. \u201cI don\u2019t want to send them away, that way she\u2019s won. But I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with them. I can\u2019t keep them here forever, can I? Like pets or slaves or something, it\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s already won, really, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d the tree replied. \u201cMight as well do what you want to do.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could go with them.\u201d Cosima was thinking of that wide open sky, the sea stretching endless before her. \u201cI wish I could go somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here any more than we do,\u201d the tree said. The others rustled softly in agreement. \u201cIf she\u2019ll let you go, why not leave?\u201d\n\u201cHow would she stop me? But where would I go? Into a nunnery? Back home?\u201d She imagined arriving at her father\u2019s estate, trooping through the little white-stone village in the hills, down to the lakeshore villa with three dozen dead foreign guards in tow. She wasn\u2019t sure whether the dark of their skin or the death in their eyes would cause more consternation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to take them, and I don\u2019t want to leave them.\u201d\nCosima almost heard the shrug, though a tree had no shoulders to shrug, no hands to spread wide. It was an expansive creaking of the branches, perhaps.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways. You\u2019re going to have to choose.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not me,\u201d Cosima said. She hesitated. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cDo you want to go?\u201d she asked Shiyam that night.\n\u201cKind of up to you,\u201d Shiyam replied. \u201cDo you want me to want to?\u201d\nI want it to be me and you, flying through the stars.\n\u201cDo you think I can trust her?\u201d Cosima said instead. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s lying, it\u2019s some trick to get me to send you all away?\u201d\nBut she remembered the shining ship in the bay. That would be some elaborate deception. And the look on Isabela\u2019s face that night, as she gazed at the red star in the sky. . . .\n\u201cOne way to find out,\u201d Shiyam said.\n* * *\nIt felt like that first morning, walking out to face a king and his army. And finding a queen instead, with soft words instead of swords. But this time she was prepared.\nWrapped warm against the chill dawn air, Cosima strode the courtyards and colonnades to Isabela\u2019s chambers, Shiyam at her back as always.\n\u201cPrincesa, wait!\u201d One of Isabela\u2019s guards tried to block her path as she approached. \u201cThe queen is still sleeping, please, wait. . . .\u201d\nCosima kept walking, and the guards backed away at a glance from Shiyam.\nIsabela wasn\u2019t sleeping when they burst through her door. Or if she had been, she woke instantly, sitting up in the vast bed that had once belonged to a prince. Her eyes met Cosima\u2019s, calm and alert.\n\u201cWell, princess?\u201d she asked mildly.\nIs there nothing I can do to surprise her? Cosima felt her face getting hot with embarrassment, anger. It didn\u2019t help that everything about this chamber reminded her of the awkward fumblings of her wedding night.\nAnd before she knew she meant to do it, she was reaching, pushing into Isabela\u2019s mind, looking for the truth there. It wasn\u2019t like a cat\u2019s mind. It wasn\u2019t like Shiyam\u2019s dark emptiness, nor even the panicked rejection of the enemy soldier. Isabela let her in, invited her calmly, guided her down pathways and through open doors. And there was the truth. Isabela\u2019s mind held hers, made her look at it.\nHer wedding day, that high summer day that had gone past in a blur of heat and crowds, of red and gold and rose petals. The lord of a neighbouring province, presenting Shiyam to her husband. A female guard, trained like the best of them, what a rare thing. A gift. Who better to watch over your princess?\nThe lord who\u2019d joined with Isabela and the king right afterward without a fight, the negotiations going back weeks, the arrangements, the plots.\nShe was always mine, Isabela told her, silently. Who do you think opened the gate?\nNo. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Why would they kill her?\nYou know why.\n\u201cStop,\u201d Cosima said out loud. She wrenched her mind out of Isabela\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d\nBut she looked at Shiyam, standing there silent, and that look crushed the breath from her body like when Shiyam had knocked her to the ground before the tiny whisper of the arrow past her ear.\n\u201cI thought you were my friend,\u201d Cosima said at last, her voice shaking. \u201cI thought you were sworn to protect me.\u201d I thought you loved me.\n\u201cI did.\u201d Shiyam\u2019s dark eyes were depthless, deathless. \u201cPrincess, didn\u2019t I keep you safe?\u201d\nCosima bit her lip, trying not to cry, she wouldn\u2019t, not in front of Isabela.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not her. She\u2019s gone. You\u2019re just me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Shiyam said, and Cosima heard it a breath before she spoke, soft as down in the breeze. She turned her face away and ran from them, from all of them.\nWildflowers brushed at her skirts, their petals wide open, fragile and unguarded in the afternoon sun. She went to her knees under the elm trees and beat her fists on the cold earth and wept.\n\u201cThey can go,\u201d she sobbed. The emptiness inside her ached like a bruise, like a kicked cat. \u201cAll of them. I don\u2019t care. I should make them walk into the sea. She can drown in the empty sea, she can break her back digging rubies, freeze her bones on the red world and never come back. I can do that, I can take myself out of them, out of her, then they\u2019re nothing but dead and I can wreck Isabela\u2019s damned ship on that frozen world and she can kill me if she wants. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d\nThe tree said nothing. Of course it didn\u2019t. It was just a tree. Cosima looked up, wiped the back of her hand across her face.\nA single broad leaf fluttered gently down. She caught it, felt it crumble in her hand, dead and dry.\n* * *\nThe palace was home to a thousand cats. Cosima picked one up and sat down on a cushioned bench with it in her lap. The cat squirmed and purred as she stroked its head with idle fingers. A thin wintry light slanted through the pergola above. Cosima watched the sky and waited for the sunset.\nShe owed that much to Shiyam. To the Shiyam who once was, the one who\u2019d kindled her empty days with kisses and laughter and brought her a rose at midsummer and bled her life out on the red stones to save her at the end. And the one who was now, who guarded her silently day and night, and still had a spark of the old Shiyam in her, and. . . .\n\u201cYou\u2019re the other half of me,\u201d Cosima said sadly. \u201cThe strong, brave half.\u201d The half Shiyam had brought alive.\nThe cat squirmed in her lap and looked up at her with lazy golden eyes. Cosima found herself playing, pushing her awareness more into the cat\u2019s mind and enjoying the sensation of her own caresses on its back, then pulling its cat-ness into her own mind and letting the animal feel the comfort of her cushioned couch, the silk of her gown against her skin. There, how do you like being a princess? Better than I do, I think.\nThe midwinter sunset was approaching fast, the pale sun dipping toward the horizon. Movement caught Cosima\u2019s eye. She stood, holding the cat in her arms. The ship was skimming across the sea, the silver sails catching the last rays of the year\u2019s sun.\nThere they go. And me here, waiting, always waiting.\nCosima felt something surge inside her.\n\u201cKeep this warm for me,\u201d she murmured to the cat. Then she reached. She let herself fly. Out of her princess-body, leaving only a spark behind, diving into the strong Shiyam-body aboard the ship.\nYou and me, flying to the stars.\nWhere shall we go, princess?\nShe glanced back, once. The indolent princess was reclining comfortably on her couch again, a tiny Cosima-spark and a whole lot of cat savouring the last of the sun.\nMaybe the red world. Maybe home. Anywhere we want. We don\u2019t have to choose now. Let\u2019s fly once around the world first.\nThe ship raced over the water toward the sunset, gathering speed, the red palace and the coastline vanishing in its gleaming wake. Then the sun dropped away into darkness and they were flying.\nAnd a thousand stars flickered into life.\nSarah L. Byrne is a writer and researcher in London, UK.

The blacksmith stole away each night to meet with Captain Rados. And there were blades to be whetted and dints to be hammered from armour.\nHe yanked her hair by the fistfuls and hacked at them with a knife. Mounds of gold gathered at her feet. She said nothing, more shocked than silent. When he was done, he turned her by the shoulders, his brow a mess of worried knots. He looked her over as he might a tempered blade or a fresh-bent plate.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo. Take off blouse,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Veina. There is no time!\u201d he snapped at her.\nWhen she had taken off the flimsy tunic\u2014rent and covered in foundry dust\u2014she stood half-naked, inching toward the smelter to keep from shivering.\nAuro returned with a bolt of canvas. Ignoring her protests, he raised her arms and held them out at her sides, like a scarecrow. He placed the canvas against her bare chest.\n\u201cHold this. Fast,\u201d he said, looking away from her, at the floor, embarrassed.\nHe walked in circles around her, unrolling the canvas, yanking the cloth, tightening it around her torso. When he had rolled out the cloth to a finger\u2019s thickness he tore it off the bolt and sewed in leather straps.\nHe gave her Red\u2019s old tunic and leggings to wear. She hadn\u2019t seen Red since they took him to defend the walls a week ago. And Pills, the week before that. It had been just Auro and her in the smithy these past days, and more swords and knives and plate and mail.\nHe wiped a finger of soot from the smelter wall and smeared it on her cheeks. Smudged it down her face with his sleeve. She frowned and grimaced but did not object. Only once she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d and to that the blacksmith responded with a grunt.\nOnce more he appraised her, the soot-faced, flat-chested girl dressed in boy\u2019s clothes. \u201cOkay. Now you are boy,\u201d he said in that thick Atumani accent.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she said with an aching flush in her cheeks.\n\u201cBecause they will come at night, looking. The men are all spent, and now the boys will have to do.\u201d He delved into a stack of old blades and sent them clattering to the floor.\n\u201cSo you want me to go?\u201d\n\u201cWar cares little for what I want.\u201d He rose from the clutter with a single blade, sheathed in leather.\n\u201cWon\u2019t they let the women and children stay?\u201d She trembled, confused and enraged with disbelief.\nShe\u2019d never thought of herself as anything more than a waif. All of Torfith knew them as Auro\u2019s orphans, after all. Red, Pills, and her. The blacksmith had taken them in, fed them, and paid them a pittance. He worked them hard and into long nights and heard neither cry nor complaint. But never had she thought that it would come to this. Sacrificed at the wall to buy the old man a few more days of pounding metal in his smithy.\n\u201cYou are not woman. You are not children.\u201d He kneeled in front of her and strapped the scabbard to her waist, but the blade he kept by his side. He fussed over her, straightening her shoulders, pushing her chin up with his finger, making her stand tall. She glowered down her nose at him.\n\u201cI was little boy at Keltah when it fell,\u201d he mumbled as he fiddled with the straps. \u201cThere, they took the boys for slaves. But the women and the girls. . . . I saw what happens to the women and children left behind.\u201d He shook his head.\n\u201cIf the wall is breached, they will retreat. Rados will ride back, and this place will be overrun. The enemy has been at the wall for four months. Hard men who have slept on cold ground and breathed only the stench of blood and death in all that time.\u201d He gave the strap a painful yank. \u201cWhen they take this place, it is better to die out there than stay back here.\u201d\nHe put the sword in her hand and gripped her palm. His calloused, meaty fingers curled around hers.\n\u201cYou stay behind the line and let the soldiers do the fighting. If anyone gets too close, you run back.\u201d A brief kindness passed over his eyes. \u201cIf you have to, you use this. It is rare. Coldar steel. Very light, but strong, and it will cut.\u201d\nThat night, they sat at the table to eat. The sounds of meat and bone in stew were loud in the absence of words. On any other night, she\u2019d be sitting with Red and Pills by the smelter, on the floor. They\u2019d listen to the coals pop and hiss as they ate scraps. But tonight, the portions on her plate were generous. And there were seconds and thirds even when she hadn\u2019t asked.\nShe put away the plates after dinner and brought him his cup of wine from the cellar.\n\u201cAuro?\u201d she called through the heavy silence.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep me here as long as there\u2019s metal to be mended. If the wall falls, I will take the mule and head south, through the mountains, to Sauli.\u201d\nShe nodded and swallowed hard. She hoped that he\u2019d ask her to meet him there or say something like, \u201cIf you make it there, come find me.\u201d But he didn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou cannot cry,\u201d he said, sucking the last drop from his empty cup. \u201cWhen they come to take you, don\u2019t cry or scream or say anything. If they leave you behind, I will not take you with me.\u201d His hand squirmed around the stem of his cup. And his eyes had sunk deeper into his face.\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said.\nThe chair shrieked as the blacksmith got to his feet. Without a word he took his cup and went down into the cellar.\nThe soldiers came a little past midnight, calling for the levy. She opened the door with the sword already at her waist and a shirt of mail thrown over herself.\nThe soldier at the door looked down at her. He looked more a grave digger than a soldier, a pale-faced man with a grey beard, clothed in muddy armour and hunched by an ill-mended back. He frowned at her and twisted his face to a scowl before he spat and said, \u201cG\u2019wan then, boy, back with the rest o\u2019 the levy.\u201d\nShe walked to the back, behind a cart loaded with swords and armour, where the rest of the boys waited. They stood ankle deep in the mud, stifling sobs and blinking back the wet from their eyes.\nMoments later Auro\u2019s shadow staggered to the door. He was drunk. She bit her lip and steeled her face to keep from coming to tears. She looked at the fat blacksmith in the doorway, hoping to catch his eyes. But all she could see was his breath. Foggy gasps into the night as she marched with the levy in funereal silence.\n* * *\nAt midday the enemy charge broke through the front line. Four chargers ran through, blinded and driven by reckless frenzy. The archers at the wall let fly. The last charger took an arrow that tore through his cheek and shot out in a black mist. He ran a good ten feet farther before he plunged headlong into the ground and came to a halt with his face in the mud and arse hoisted high. That was the first thing she learned of war. That blood runs black. And that once the afternoon sun is past, it looks much the same as the mud she was standing in.\nThey had left her and the smaller boys back with the second line. Reserves, positioned closest to the wall. Their defences were stretched. Only one in a dozen was a true soldier. The rest were sell-swords and highwaymen, paid to stand alongside farmers and stable boys. The charges had begun at dawn. While the first few had been pushed back, by midday they\u2019d broken through, and now the front line was so riddled with holes that they\u2019d pulled back to the reserves.\nThe battle groaned and grunted ahead of her. She\u2019d taken Auro\u2019s advice and stayed back, but they were all in it now. Hands to backs, feet digging into mud, calves taut, teeth gritted. A tired roar sounded from the writhing mass, and they pushed a little more to gain a hard-fought inch. She was at a stranger\u2019s back, her face digging into his spine, nose crushed against mail and lungs so pressed that she breathed only during brief reprieves.\nSomething snapped inside the melee, and without warning they fell in a heap. She sensed a figure flying over the top of her. Then came the crashing of armour and blades. She flipped around and saw an enemy charger hacking away at the man who had stood behind her. He had a knife as long as her forearm, and he stabbed wildly at his victim. She gasped for breath. There was mud in her nose and it tasted like cold, sour nothing. Her hand, as if by a will of its own, patted the ground, feeling for the hilt of Auro\u2019s sword.\nWhen she found it, the weight in her hand was comforting. She grasped it, and with a single motion she got off the ground. She slashed at the charger\u2019s back and the blade sliced with surprising ease through leather, into flesh. At first, the charger took no notice. Then he reached awkwardly for his back, turning and roaring at her.\nBehind all that blood and war-paint, his eyes burned with such anger that Veina felt the sudden urge to apologise. She put her arm up and stepped back. Then something thundered into the left side of her face. She heard the bones shift and pop inside her head. Her feet left the ground. Nothing made sense.\nShe opened her mouth but couldn\u2019t manage a voice. Only hollow moaning sounds like some wounded beast. The salty warmth of blood was creeping down her throat. She willed her eyes open and saw the sky. A shadowed giant stood over her. She couldn\u2019t see his face through the tangle of beard wet with drool and blood. Puffs of fog rose from his helm as he hefted an axe over his head.\nNo. I don\u2019t want to die, she thought.\nThe giant heaved and the blade came down. Not yet. Her muscles convulsed and twitched of their own will. Bolts of pain shot through her face. But she felt her head shift a few inches to the side. Then came the metal whine of the axe, bedding itself where her face had lain only an instant before.\nFuck all that talk of not crying. She bawled, and it came out of her like a dying cat. The sword was still in her hand, her grip on the blade just as hard. She felt the axe lifting off the ground, showering mud over her face. She gritted her shattered jaw and rose up. Her sword was pointed forward at the giant. His axe was still in upswing when she felt the blade pierce through flesh.\nThe giant did not cry out. He made a sound like a large, heavy dog barking. She shook and twisted the blade in place and realised the sword was pushed deep through the giant\u2019s thigh, near his crotch. She felt blood gushing out on her arms. The giant shuddered, wobbled, and dropped his axe behind him before he came crashing down on her. She cried out as the weight of him squeezed all the wailing from her. He wasn\u2019t dead yet. She could hear him breathing, his face next to hers. The air hissed in tired bursts from his lips, as if whispering his death in her ear.\nShe whimpered, closed her eyes, and lay there. Just for a little while, just until the pain goes away, she told herself.\n* * *\n\u201cA fine kill!\u201d The corpse shifted. By inches at first, and then with a heave, it was dragged off her.\n\u201cCould do without the crying and pissin\u2019 yer pants, but still, a fine kill by any measure. Look at the size of him!\u201d\nLaughter. More than one man.\nShe opened her eyes, but only the right one complied. The left sent a barb of pain shooting down her face.\n\u201cOoh, that must\u2019ve hurt, eh?\u201d A man was squatting over her. His face was like parched land. Bronzed and scoured, with wrinkles and cracks all over. Not old, only weathered.\nHe inspected her face as well\u2014turning it from side to side, using his thumbs to push and palpate.\n\u201cJaw\u2019s fucked, but keep yer gob shut and it\u2019ll heal. Nothing else broken. But we\u2019ll have to take care o\u2019 that,\u201d he said, looking at her closed eye. He nodded at someone, and she felt her hands being held down. She tried to see who it was but the wrinkled man stopped her. \u201cLie still if ye want to look out that eye again.\u201d\nHe pulled out an old beaten flask from his waist and then a blade. It was smaller and keener than a knife.\n\u201cScream if you have to, but keep yer jaws grit.\u201d He put the keen edge to the brow above her swollen eye and cut into it.\nThe pain was singular, and she felt it down the side of her face. Warm blood came gushing from the cut. She moved her hands, lifted her feet, but the wrinkled man sat back down on her and whoever had a grip on her hands wasn\u2019t letting go.\n\u201cLie still, ye rat. I haven\u2019t even gotten to the best part yet!\u201d\nShe had both eyes closed, whimpering, when she felt a cold liquid wash over the cut. It smelled foul, and soon she felt the sting of alcohol. Her face was on fire. She thrashed and flailed so hard that she thought her hands would pop out her shoulders. After a long wait in blurring agony, when the pain dulled to a throb, she stopped moving and felt the weight of the man shift off her.\nWhen her senses returned, she opened her good eye and found that there was a small fire by her. The sky had darkened to a cold, bitter night, and the warmth came as a comfort.\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d a familiar voice greeted her. The wrinkled man held out his battered flask.\nShe shook her head.\n\u201cGo on, lad. Ye\u2019ll thank me later.\u201d\nShe nodded and took a sip from the flask, then a gulp, and she swallowed before she could taste it. The sour liquid burned as it went down, and then it turned around and flew up her nose. She snorted, coughed, and her jaw ached so she had to cup her chin to keep the pain at bay.\nThe men about the fire laughed again. \u201cYe\u2019ll still be pretty in the morning. Don\u2019t fret,\u201d the wrinkled man winked. \u201cWhat\u2019s yer name, lad?\u201d\n\u201cVeina,\u201d she answered, but caught herself, remembering that she was supposed to be a boy. As it turned out, with half her face numbed and swollen, the name came out as Ven.\n\u201cVen? What kind of name\u2019s that?\u201d He frowned. \u201cNever heard of a Ven before. You?\u201d He turned to the large man beside him, who was whetting the edge of a sword as tall as her. The man shook his head.\n\u201cWell, this is Bull, right here.\u201d Bull kept his eyes on the sword and grunted. \u201cThat\u2019s Carling Jon.\u201d The spidery figure on the other side of the fire wiggled his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m Thom Westways. But they call me Rook.\u201d The wrinkled man nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to give you a name for downing that big feller. Something fitting.\u201d He scratched at his stubble. \u201cHow\u2019s about the Badger?\u201d\nThe other men laughed.\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t no funny business, being called the Badger!\u201d Rook shushed them with a wave of his hand. \u201cStout, fearless things they are. You\u2019ve heard of the honey badger, have you, Ven?\u201d\nVeina shook her head.\n\u201cTiny little shits. But they won\u2019t shrink away from a fight. They\u2019ll take on dogs, lions, snakes, even bulls!\u201d He slapped a hand on Bull\u2019s back. \u201cThey\u2019ll attack first, always for the kill, and they always\u201d\u2014he paused to make sure everyone was listening\u2014\u201calways go for the balls.\u201d\nJon burst into laughter at that, kicking at the mud with his feet.\n\u201cNo joking! They\u2019ll gnaw your nuts right off! Look at \u2019im!\u201d Rook pointed at the corpse of the giant that lay nearby with a deep gash on his inner thigh, dangerously close to his privates.\nShe wanted to look away. But now that all the fear was past, there was a reluctant pride bubbling underneath. She\u2019d felled a soldier. Auro had asked her to stay in the back, keep away from the fighting, and she had tried. But when the fight had come calling, the blacksmith\u2019s orphan had felled a giant. Or a very large man, at the least.\n\u201cFirst kill?\u201d Bull\u2019s voice was like smoke from the bottom of a well, heavier than air.\nVeina nodded at him.\n\u201cI can pray for you if you want. I know the words.\u201d\nShe saw that his offer was well meant. No doubt he knew the toll that killing took on a soul, but she shook her head no. All the praying she had done to that day had never helped. She doubted it would do her any good now.\n\u201cDid we win?\u201d She looked at the fires on the far horizon. Heard the sounds of soldiers picking at the dead, salvaging weapons and armour, piling corpses on pyres.\n\u201cHa!\u201d Rook turned to look with her. \u201cNo, lad. Thayn leads this assault, and his blood-sworn haven\u2019t even entered the fray yet. He has a horde at his call, and we\u2019ve hardly enough left to hold this arsehole of a town. Rados will sound the retreat in the morning. Already, he\u2019s taken his best riders southward. He\u2019ll leave the rest o\u2019 these unlucky sops to slow down Thayn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of Torfith?\u201d Veina asked, thinking of Auro toiling in his smithy or drunk on the floor of his cellar.\n\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Rook turned his back to her. \u201cTowns survive. War after war, the cobbles and walls and roof and board, they endure. It\u2019s the people that\u2019s fucked.\u201d\nJon snickered. Veina had thought he\u2019d been asleep. Bull had sheathed his sword and was watching the smoky sky so silently that he might as well have been.\nIt was well before dawn when she heard Rook\u2019s whispers. \u201cOy, lad! Ven! Wake up!\u201d He shook her.\nThe fire was on its last flames, licking the bed of glowing embers. Bull was up, sword strapped to his back, and Jon was walking ahead, barely visible in the moonlight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re off,\u201d Rook whispered.\n\u201cYou are?\u201d\n\u201cAye. No sense staying back for the slaughter. This one\u2019s already lost.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that deserting?\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d he laughed. \u201cThink I\u2019ll take my chances with the bounty-men rather than Thayn\u2019s sworn. Besides, there\u2019s always a pardon saved for a sell-sword. Always more wars to be fought.\u201d\nHe put a hand on her shoulder and leaned closer in. \u201cWe had a fourth with us. Good man by the name of Corey Darkeye. Fell to a charge two days ago. We\u2019re looking to take on another, and you\u2019ll be smart to come along and leave this place. So will ye?\u201d He looked at her and grinned like a man ill acquainted with the act.\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know how to be a sell-sword.\u201d\n\u201cHa! Well, neither does Bull, but he doesn\u2019t let that stop him now, does he?\u201d\nShe saw that all humour was lost on Bull.\n\u201cCome on, lad, say yer piece. Any moment now the flags will come waving!\u201d\nShe turned to Torfith, in the direction of Auro\u2019s smithy. No smoke rising from its stack, no whooshing of the bellows. Only the grey pall of coming dawn that seemed to blanket the place. Only days ago she\u2019d been bending plate for the old blacksmith, and now it was, in part, his fault that she found herself armed with a thin sword, with her face beaten to a pulp. Still, she hoped that he had taken the mule and was on his way to Sauli.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n* * *\nShe was no sell-sword and certainly not some vagabond boy with dreams of battle and blade-work. It was a hard life, she found over the next days and nights. They had travelled slowly and through treacherous land. Long treks, mostly in cover of dark, through plummeting slopes and bogland to avoid running into Thayn\u2019s scouts. She hadn\u2019t slept in days. Her jaw had set strangely and her chin jutted out to the left, giving her face a permanent snarl.\nShe found that she did not like Carling Jon, who had a habit of sneaking up on you at odd times. Bull, as ever, was friendly as a stone, which is to say he was quiet and cold. And with Rook, she could never tell. Sometimes she thought he was kind and warm like Auro, and at other times she feared he\u2019d slit her throat and leave her to the wolves. She worried that they had begun to suspect all was not as it seemed with the Badger. She slinked away at morning as the men pissed at the trees and wiped their arses with leaves. She never bathed in the streams as they did, and always she wore that canvas.\nThis was not the life for her, she had decided. At the rare, quiet moments of their journey, she found herself hoping that they would reach Sauli, and perhaps she might see Auro again. He might ask her to stay. They might find scant work at first, but eventually they\u2019d have a smithy. It would be hard work, of course. Difficult to get by at first. But perhaps, with time, things could go back to the way they had been.\nThen halfway down the slope into the valley, only a few days from Sauli, they came across a mule in a ditch by the road. Arrows were stuck in its neck and one bedded deep between the ribs. A grey tongue lolled, and the eyes bulged yellow and clouded. She recognised the blacksmith\u2019s mark on the shoes. A few yards ahead, covered in a blanket of flies, a corpse lay face down in the mud. She knew without turning him over that it was Auro.\n\u201cWe should keep on,\u201d Carling Jon mumbled, and Bull seemed to agree, with a nod at the road. She wanted to keep on. The last place she wanted to be was there, looking at Auro\u2019s bloated corpse. And yet the sight of him, fly covered and mud caked, seemed to root her.\nYou silly, silly girl. Who was he to her? No one. Nothing. The most he had done was give her some food and a roof. She imagined if he had meant any more to her\u2014something like a father, perhaps\u2014then underneath her ribs, under that canvas, her heart might have broken.\nRook put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Badge. No.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIf you\u2019ll keep to the road with us you can\u2019t cry n\u2019more. If you don\u2019t dry the tears now, you never will.\u201d\nShe watched him, breath whooshing in her nose, mouth in a broken-jawed snarl, chest heaving. She looked into his dried-up desert eyes. He gripped the back of her neck, and she held it all in.\n\u201cCome, we\u2019ll dig him a hole. Keep the flies off him.\u201d He ruffled her hair.\n\u201cDo what? We ought to keep on if you don\u2019t want Thayn\u2019s men leavin\u2019 us face down in the mud,\u201d Jon whined, but a heavy hand smacked him in the back.\n\u201cWe dig,\u201d Bull declared, and that was that.\n\u201cOf course! We dig. Yer all thick in the head is what.\u201d Jon stomped off to the side, looking for soft ground to dig into.\nThat was when she decided to stay. In that moment she knew that she\u2019d dig many graves and leave more corpses behind before it was all done. But like this, on the road, in wandering company, she might just come to bear it.\nLike blackbirds, they followed where the war went. Torfith, Sauli, Meshna\u2014half-holds and vills and small towns with walls to defend. Places with people and lives to feed the insatiable war that devoured everything in its path and left a trail of pits. Pits for corpses, pits for shit and piss, and pits for all things good and peaceful so the shovel-men could come and bury it all in the mud. Whether war moved men was questionable, but it moved the earth\u2014that much was sure.\nCarling Jon they lost in the battle at Meshna. The savages from Coldar attacked at night. Forest men who had learned to see in the dark, they broke upon the camp without warning. All the steel and armour in the world was no good if you didn\u2019t know where to stab and where to fend. They ploughed through the soldiers at Meshna in a matter of minutes. Veina had holed up with Rook at the base of the southern guard-house when she heard the screams. Then Bull was running toward them, screaming to scatter and run.\nThey slipped away and were well into the eastern woods before Rook asked about Carling Jon.\n\u201cTook an axe to the face as he slept,\u201d Bull said without any emotion. But his eyes were fixed on ghosts only he could see. \u201cI said the words over his corpse after I choked the life out of the dog who put his axe there.\u201d He nodded, and that was the last thing he said for weeks.\nVeina tried to get him talking again. She asked him if he wanted to pray, if he could teach her how. But Bull said nothing. As the days went by, she saw that he was becoming part of the earth. Less man and more like a tree. Like some ancient thing that lived outside the realm of ordinary people and ordinary feelings.\nOne night as they sat about a fire in a forest, north of some other lost battleground, avoiding more scouts and feeling more bounty hunters, Bull turned to her and spoke.\n\u201cI cannot feel the cold anymore. Nor can I feel the fire. I cannot remember why I kill. I cannot remember why I pray,\u201d he said.\nIn the morning when she awoke, Bull was gone. Not a blade of grass was out of place, not a twig broken, nor a branch bent. For a large man, Bull had learned not to take up too much space. And just as he had come to her, by chance and in firelight, so he had left.\n* * *\nAnd so, it came as no surprise that she found herself with Rook, hiding from bounty hunters in the hollowed remains of a skeleton town on the outskirts of Temur. She had lost count of the battles, skirmishes, near escapes and almost victories. They\u2019d deserted too often, they\u2019d been pardoned more than they deserved, and Rook Westways was a name that had begun to stink of defeat.\n\u201cWe need a win, that\u2019s all.\u201d He grimaced as he shifted weight onto his ankle, but it was no good.\n\u201cNo one ever really wins. One side just leaves feeling a little less shitty than the other. Isn\u2019t that what you said?\u201d She yanked his arm around her shoulder.\n\u201cAhaha! Yes, yes I did. But you get your name on a good kill or two, you take the head of a named man or a blood-sworn, and all\u2019s forgiven. Because men will fight for your name and swing harder knowing that you\u2019re on their side, see? It doesn\u2019t matter if you win or lose the war, Ven. Just that you kill someone worth killing.\u201d He had a strange sort of look in his eyes. \u201cThere was a time Rook Westways was a name worth killing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWell it won\u2019t be for long, if we don\u2019t get you inside and get that ankle tended to.\u201d\nShe had to drag him up the stone steps and toward the large building that loomed ahead. There wasn\u2019t much left of the town. Stone piles, splintered boards, and dust. There were four buildings still standing. The one to her left looked like it was ready to go, moaning and creaking in the wind. The two to her right were too small. It wouldn\u2019t take much to smoke them out of there. The big one up ahead\u2014not great, but it had possibilities.\nIt might have been an inn or a boarding house, she thought. The place stank of rotten wood, and there were things growing from the walls that had not seen sunlight in a while. The cellar was empty, she checked. And the floor upstairs groaned so much that she thought it better left alone.\n\u201cGaaaaah!\u201d Rook clawed at his ankle, crawling to a corner, resting against the wall.\nShe kneeled at his feet and pulled off a shoe. It was slick with blood and puss. The bandaging was soaked and coloured in sickly hues.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look good,\u201d she whispered in the dark.\n\u201cFeels even less so.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a fever.\u201d\n\u201cMust\u2019ve stuck me with a fouled blade, the bastards,\u201d he wheezed. The light outside was fast dwindling and the sky was the colour of Rook\u2019s ankle. They tried not to look at it.\n\u201cWe need to get you to a town, Rook.\u201d She tore off another piece of the canvas around her chest.\nRook had surely seen the cloth wound around her by now. But if he had noticed anything, he didn\u2019t let it show.\n\u201cCan\u2019t go to no town with the bounty-men on our tail,\u201d he rasped.\n\u201cMaybe we lost them. I didn\u2019t see them behind us.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, I wish that was true, Badge.\u201d He winced as she poured water from her canteen on his ankle. \u201cBut that\u2019s Cole Egan\u2019s men on our tail, and I wager he won\u2019t be far behind himself. They\u2019ll be coming in the night. You can be sure of that.\u201d He held his sword close to his chest. \u201cIf we\u2019re both still alive in the morning, then you can get me to a\u2014where are you going?\u201d\nShe was in the doorway, looking back at him and then out at the road into town. The bald, sparse landscape was dotted with silhouette trees and night-birds taking flight. She couldn\u2019t have picked a worse place to hide. If Egan\u2019s men were tailing them, all they had to do was keep their eyes open and they\u2019d know exactly where to find her.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go find some wood that doesn\u2019t stink of rot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cFire. Need to keep warm. And before you say no, if they\u2019re on our tail they already know where we are. There\u2019s no sense in hiding.\u201d\nRook didn\u2019t disagree.\nWhen the bounty-men rode into town, the sun was well set and Veina had gotten the fires started. There were four\u2014one in each building.\n\u201cClever.\u201d Joss Manard narrowed his eyes, smirking. He climbed off his horse, and the three men behind him followed. They tethered their horses to a lone fence that was guarding absolutely nothing.\nVeina knew Manard by reputation, and the bald man hefting a sword over his shoulder was a Northman savage by the name of Dreis. The other two were soldiers in the black and gold of Governor Rowan\u2019s office. They weren\u2019t here for the kill, only to back them into a corner, to keep them from fleeing.\nEgan would be here in the morning to do the killing. But she\u2019d be damned if she let them have it so easy. Manard would have to come find them. She was counting on it.\n\u201cFlo, was it?\u201d Manard nodded at one of the soldiers.\n\u201cAye?\u201d\n\u201cGo look in the big one, up ahead.\u201d He jutted his chin at the building. \u201cReckon that\u2019s where I\u2019d go. The two over there are too small and the one farther up doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll last the night.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Flo nodded and gripped his sword.\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t do nothing foolish. Just get eyes on Westways and that boy with him.\u201d\nFlo stepped as if he was on ice. Veina watched him make his way toward the old inn. She could hear the soldier\u2019s nervous steps even where she was, by the ruined building. She waited until light from the inn glowed off his skin. Then she drew back an arrow, drawstring to chin, and let go.\nThe arrow whistled past Flo before bedding itself into the ground. The boy shrieked. Veina bit the inside of her cheek in anger.\nI hate bloody bows.\nManard clicked his tongue and pointed at the groaning building to his left. \u201cThere, Dreis.\u201d\nThe bald man nodded and set off, keeping to the shadows, away from firelight. And for a big man, he made little noise.\n\u201cShit,\u201d she whispered, moving back into the crumbling structure, toward the fire she had lit within. She picked up a burning piece of timber and set it to the lone column that was holding up the building.\nCome on, get a move on, you lumbering bastard. The fire had crept halfway up the column, and the building was making ghostly sounds. Maybe that\u2019s how it\u2019d all end. Death under a pile of stones and burning wood. There are worse ways.\nA long creak sounded at the back door. Not the wind but a quiet foot, she knew.\nIt\u2019s him. Her breath hissed.\nThe door stilled for a moment and then burst inward, hinges screaming. Dreis stormed in, leading with his sword. She was already up at the window. She put her foot through the flame and kicked at the column. The burning wood gave easily. Dreis seemed confused, unsure whether he should go at her or run back out.\nIf you have to think about it, you\u2019re dead. She was barely out when the whole place came down. She scrambled away from the stone and wood that landed with a monstrous roar. A great cloud of dust rose from the ground, choking her, filling her nose. Her lungs burned but she didn\u2019t stop. She circled around to the back of the inn, back to Rook.\nA quick peek around the corner told her that Manard hadn\u2019t moved. He was by the horses, squatted on the ground, forearms on his knees, calm and still. The cold bastard. The two soldiers from the governor\u2019s forces, Flo and the other one, were not to be seen.\nShe pulled a dagger from its straps at her ankle, breathed out and calmed herself. I need to get Rook out of there, first.\nAs she reached for the back door, it swung open. She staggered back, flailing to keep her balance.\nThe boy, Flo, looked at her, confused, mouth open. She saw the fingers on his sword hand trembling, shifting for a better grip.\n\u201cS-stop!\u201d he called in his best voice.\nStop? Is that what they taught you in the soldiering school? She struggled to hold back a smile. She turned her wrist so the dagger pointed at Flo, and with the hilt held close, she rushed at him. Flo swung at her, but his grip was awkward and he was too slow. She watched him and floated inside the arc of his blade. The sword\u2019s pommel harmlessly dug into her shoulder.\n\u201cFaah!\u201d She could feel his breath on her scalp. They were close, with his sword arm around her, like a lover\u2019s embrace. He coughed twice, and then blood gurgled in his mouth before she felt it pour onto her, warm and thick. She couldn\u2019t help but think of her first kill, the bearded giant. The way his blood had poured onto her arms then.\nShe tilted her head back to look at the boy, his mouth agape, eyes rolled back to their whites. He was young. Might not have been that much older than her. Who put a sword in his hand and sent him out on his own? she wondered.\nStop it. No time for that now. She raised her knee into Flo\u2019s waist and yanked her dagger free. She stepped over his body, wiping the blade on her sleeve.\n\u201cRook?\u201d she called in a whisper. Nothing.\nOnly the sounds of popping wood and the rush of air around the fire.\nDamn it.\n\u201cRook? You there?\u201d she called. Only silence.\nShe peeked through the front door and saw that Manard was gone, and so were the horses. There was a sour tang on the back of her tongue, sweat on her palms. She knew the smell of her own skin. She knew fear.\nRook Westways, where the fuck are you?\nAs if in answer, a weak moan sounded from outside the window. Then the unmistakable hiss of a blade. The groaning was Rook, no doubt. She crawled out the window and jogged into the dark, her eyes faring better with time.\nStill no sign of Manard.\nShe was close to the smaller buildings when she saw two figures ahead. Rook was on the ground, groaning in that feverish voice, squirming in the dirt like a snake as a man stood over him. His foot was planted firmly on Rook\u2019s ankle. It was the other soldier from Rowan\u2019s office.\nShe readied her dagger, took a wider path on soft feet and quiet breath. The mat of grass rustled beneath her, but she doubted the soldier heard it, not with Rook moaning like that. She crouched as she approached, held her breath and then rushed.\nThe soldier\u2019s back presented a clear target, an easy kill. But at the very last moment the soldier turned. He swung around with the flat of his sword held in front of him. Blades clanged. She felt the impact all the way to her shoulder. As she glanced by him, the soldier raised a knee into her gut. For a moment she was floating, insensate. Then the ground woke her, a thundering slap as she landed face first on the grating surface. She could feel something loosen inside her mouth. Teeth? Jaw again?\nI\u2019ll take toothless over dead, any day.\nShe willed herself up, her head swam, she stumbled and fell again. The soldier was smiling. She could see the white of his teeth through the fog of pain. Once more she hefted herself off the ground. But there was a nagging hook in her left leg and it refused to keep her up. She hopped backward, putting distance between herself and the soldier. She looked down and saw that there was an arrow in her calf.\nManard!\nThere was nothing to be done about it. If he shot another arrow now, the best she could do was hope that he\u2019d miss. She moved in a circle, keeping her eyes on the soldier in front. At least she could see him. At least she knew where he was.\nHe came for her but ignored Rook on the ground\u2014a mistake. Rook slashed at the soldier\u2019s ankle with the small blade he hid in his belt. He cut something important, and the soldier\u2019s leg folded under him. The man went down in a heap.\nVeina took her chance. She leapt onto his back and with quick, violent thrusts put her dagger in, spraying the iron taste of blood everywhere.\nAnother arrow came. She heard it cutting through the air before it struck the dead soldier\u2019s arm, inches from her thigh.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d she cried out, reeling backward, taking what meagre cover the soldier\u2019s corpse afforded.\nAnother arrow. Into the ground this time.\nShe could hear Manard growling. She looked up and saw him walking toward her. He tossed the bow aside and reached for the blade at his waist.\n\u201cOh, by all the shitty fates! Just stay still and take it, why don\u2019t you?\u201d he snarled. His eyes were calm and sharp like glass. His face bore the inkling of a smile.\nShe had hoped that he\u2019d ignore Rook. He didn\u2019t. He put a weighty boot down on Rook\u2019s hand. She heard bones crunching and tendons snapping. Rook moaned, face buried in the dirt, too tired to scream.\nEyes on her, Manard took the thin dagger from Rook\u2019s broken fingers. He threw it aside, and Veina felt her chest tighten with fear at the sound of it hitting the ground. This was no boy-soldier made for standing watch outside a Governor\u2019s office. How many times had Manard closed in on some cornered prey? How many times had he smiled with that veiled amusement?\nVeina gritted her teeth and yanked the arrow out. Pain tore its way up her leg, pushing the air out of her lungs in gasps and whimpers. Don\u2019t cry. She tightened her grip around the dagger and stood. With her other hand she drew the blade that hung at her waist. Auro\u2019s steel, once more in her hand.\nManard swung first. She bounded away but stumbled when she shifted weight to her injured leg. She dragged her foot along the ground and let out a sharp howl but steadied herself.\nManard thrust his sword. She blocked with Auro\u2019s blade, but the impact clattered her bones, and she landed on her arse.\n\u201cYou plan on dancing all night?\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re boring the hell out of me.\u201d\n\u201cNo one asked you to dance along.\u201d\nFor a moment his eyes flickered with anger. Good.\nManard\u2019s swings came faster and harder. She parried and fended a blur of steel and breaths. The tongue of a sword licked at her shoulder. A red line appeared, and then the burning heat of blood trickling down her arm.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting slower.\u201d He smiled.\nShe said nothing. The leather grip of her dagger chirped as she curled her palm.\nThis is it. Please work.\nAt the first sign of movement she flung Auro\u2019s sword at Manard\u2019s head. She put her back into it, bent sideways, bore the pain of her injured calf twisting on itself. She shrieked. The blade sailed through the air. Not graceful, like a spear, but it did the job.\nManard\u2019s eyes widened. He\u2019d had daggers flung at him, yes. He wore mail on his arms to deflect them. She imagined he\u2019d had larger swords flung at him, but always with both hands and with great effort. Easy to get out of the way. But now? The blade was almost on him. He ducked and altered the swing of his sword, whipping it upward to shield his face.\nVeina\u2019s sword clanged against his. He yelled, as if expecting pain, but there was none. The blade was unusually light. When the shock passed, he seemed to find a sort of nervous amusement and laughed. His eyes darted back to Veina, but to no avail.\nThen with a squelching hiss she administered the first shock of pain. An alarming barb in his ribs. Then in his back under the shoulder blade, twisting, tearing shreds of flesh. His sword arm gave up and his fingers slacked. She imagined his insides snapping and twanging like fiddle strings. The heavy blade slipped from his hand, as if his mind was still trying to grasp what was happening.\nVeina yanked the dagger from his back, and with an animal scream she thrust it into the small of his neck. Manard made no sound.\nLike a badger, she thought, always for the kill.\nShe left her dagger there. Manard fell, face first, onto the ground.\nVeina collapsed after him. She looked up at the stars littered against the black and the hazy moon shrouded by clouds.\nAll who had come there that night, sell-swords and soldiers and bounty-men, boys and girls\u2014all lay on the ground, under sky, very still.\nHow many dead? How many alive? We\u2019ll see in a bit. But first, I have to close my eyes and breathe and cry, just a little.\nA rush of relief and pain rose to her face. Her lips curved down and her ears burned hot. But the tears did not come.\n* * *\nBy the time Rook awoke, she had dragged him inside and to a fire, wrapped his broken fingers in canvas, and patched her own wounded leg. She sat across from him, topless without the canvas around her breasts. She tore another shred and wrapped it around her shoulder.\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Rook said in a thin voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got more hair on me chest.\u201d He grinned.\nMade her laugh. The bastard.\n\u201cMy leg\u2019s gone,\u201d Rook gasped, \u201ccan\u2019t feel it.\u201d He gritted his teeth and squeezed his knee, as if hoping that it might wake his leg. \u201cNothing below the knee\u201d\u2014he looked down his pants\u2014\u201cand the black is up to my thigh, Badge! Any higher and I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re already dead, Rook,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that mean, I\u2019m dead?\u201d\n\u201cYour leg\u2019s gone. Your sword hand\u2019s broken. Fever\u2019s taken all your strength.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMy left leg\u2019s no good either.\u201d She pointed at the bloodied bandage around her calf. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Ven, we\u2019ll walk a day. Crawl, if we have to, and we\u2019ll be at Three Clovers. Might be we\u2019ll see a cart on the way. Might be we chance on a bottle-man or a doctor.\u201d\n\u201cOr might be we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t s-say it like. . . .\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said it, Rook. Might-bes are for poets and dreamers. Might-be-nots are for the men in the mud. Well, we\u2019re in the mud now.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking tell me my own words!\u201d He bared his teeth at her.\nShe said nothing, but she could see the truth setting into his face.\n\u201cHow far are they?\u201d he asked, at last.\n\u201cThere\u2019s dust on the eastward edge. Little more than an hour\u2019s ride, I\u2019d say. I\u2019m assuming Egan and his men have fresh horses.\u201d\n\u201cHorses! Horses! What about Manard\u2019s horses?\u201d\n\u201cI checked. He cut \u2019em loose before he came after us.\u201d She shook her head.\nVeina got up and limped over to the corner of the room, wrapping the remaining canvas around her chest. Flo\u2019s corpse was propped up against the wall. She\u2019d dressed him in her own flimsy clothes. His mail, black-and-gold tunic, leather leggings, and gloves all lay stacked at his side. Veina stripped until the canvas and a dirty old cotton swatch wrapped around her waist were all she had on.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Rook mumbled, watching as the first rays of morning gleamed off her skin.\nIn silence, Veina took the boy\u2019s clothes and put them on one by one, checking, pinching, pulling to make sure they fit her. He was only a little bigger than her, and fortunately the boy had small feet. As she guided the mail over her cut shoulder, she cast a brief glance at Rook.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is,\u201d Rook said with a scornful nod.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019ll have to be.\u201d\n\u201cWe could still run, Badge.\u201d His voice hung in the air like the last whiff of a burnt-out fire.\n\u201cThey\u2019d catch up with us in a blink and you know it.\u201d\n\u201cI saved you, Badge.\u201d His voice quivered. \u201cSo many times.\u201d He looked away with a bitter frown, rubbing at his thigh.\nShe walked to him then, dressed in black and gold. She looked like any other young boy in the governor\u2019s service. All she had to do was clean her face a bit and even Rook might not have known her at a glance.\nShe sat down and put a gentle hand on his face. She leaned to kiss his forehead, his nose. Then she kissed him softly on his leathery, cracked lips.\n\u201cWhen the other soldier had you on the ground, you knew you were gone then, Rook. You could have called to me. Warned me it was a trap. Least I could have made it away. But you didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t blame you at all. You rolled the dice on my life and bought yourself a while longer. Everyone gets a roll, don\u2019t they?\u201d she said. Rook had told her that once. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now.\u201d\nShe got up, strapped Auro\u2019s sword at her waist, and walked to the door. Outside, a fog of grey dust trailed from the horizon, moving closer.\nShe stepped out as Rook called to her in his old, calm voice, \u201cCall me, when it\u2019s time.\u201d\nBy the time Egan\u2019s men came over the eastward hill, the sky was lit to a full morning. Manard and the other corpse had caught the attention of vultures, who sat at high places all around the ruin.\nThe man leading Egan\u2019s bevy pointed. \u201cThere!\u201d\nVeina stood in plain sight outside the inn, dressed in Flo\u2019s clothing.\n\u201cRook. . . .\u201d she called out. But not so loud that Egan\u2019s men could hear.\nA moment later, Rook Westways stood in the door, sword strapped to his broken hand with a leather belt. He leaned on the doorframe, struggling to keep straight.\n\u201cYer a fine sell-sword, Badge. A fine one,\u201d he said.\nA plump vulture, perched on the roof, spotted Egan riding over the hill and let out a guttural call.\nRook\u2019s eyes flashed. He leaned forward, almost falling, and launched himself with his good leg. Veina rushed at him, Auro\u2019s blade drawn.\nThey met in the middle. In blood, pain, and the last gasp of fury. She drove Auro\u2019s blade clean through his chest. He barely had his sword up. Rook\u2019s knees buckled, but she held him up by the waist as long as she could.\nShe whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . sorry, Rook.\u201d\nBut the vultures were calling, mad with joy. Another corpse for the feast. She didn\u2019t think he heard her.\nShe felt his fingers digging into her shoulder. For a moment he stopped shivering. His dried, arid face grinned at her through chipped teeth, and then he let go.\nNot now. Don\u2019t cry, she told herself.\n\u201cEy, boy!\u201d Egan called as he came past the lonely fence at the edge of town. The rest of his men followed.\nEgan was a pale man with features like knife cuts. He was old, and his beard and moustache were groomed and combed. A killing man who had risen to better things, she could tell.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Joss?\u201d Egan jogged up to her.\n\u201cDead, my lord,\u201d she said in a deeper voice than usual.\n\u201cBy whose hand?\u201d\n\u201cHis, my lord,\u201d she pointed at Rook. \u201cSneaked up on us in the dark. Picked us off, one by one. He\u2019d have got me too if it wasn\u2019t for Manard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Egan narrowed his eyes at her.\nShe wondered if this was to be her last clean breath. \u201cFlo, my lord, from the governor\u2019s bounties office.\u201d She tried to catch an expression from Egan. A hint of life or death.\n\u201cFlo. . . . Right.\u201d Egan nodded. \u201cThere was another with him.\u201d He dug his toe into Rook\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cYes, my lord. A boy. He\u2019s dead too.\u201d\nOne of the men checked the inn. \u201cOne\u2019s dead in there, Cole. Looks like they stayed to clean and patch their wounds. There\u2019s a lot of blood by the fire, yellowed and stinking.\u201d\nEgan nodded, kicking at Rook\u2019s broken sword hand. \u201cThey said Rook had a festered foot when he deserted from Darheen. But still a tough bastard,\u201d he spat. \u201cLook at him. Came out with a sword tied to a broken hand. That\u2019s real steel for ya.\u201d\nEgan\u2019s men nodded in agreement.\n\u201cAnd it takes some too, to kill a man like Rook Westways.\u201d Egan slapped a hand to Veina\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll be needing a name for a kill that fine.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be? Flo the Red? Last Man Flo?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019ll please my lord\u201d\u2014Veina made a small bow\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve already got a name.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And what is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Badger, my lord. That\u2019s what my friends call me.\u201d\nEgan frowned. \u201cThe Badger?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d\nHis men looked at him and shrugged.\n\u201cAll right, then. The Badger!\u201d He raised his sword, as did the rest. They whooped and cheered and clapped for her. She smiled at them, as though with joy and relief.\nOf course, these things she put to the back of her mind in time. Or they dwindled into faded, less stark versions of themselves. All the broken places, all the graves, blurring into shapeless memories. What stuck with her were two things: the name, Badger, and the memory of the vultures circling, black winged and patient. She would remember them forever. The way they spoke in a secret language that she thought she might understand if she listened.\nRam V is an author from Mumbai who debuted in 2012 with the ongoing comic series Aghori.

So close to Chicago I can smell it.\nAnd I can: car exhaust, hot asphalt, impatience.\nHer reply: Your almost home!\nI tell myself not to take a typo as a portent.\n* * *\nHere is something I don\u2019t know about Chicago until I get to my apartment, look out the window, and then give in to the ever-present urge to do research:\nThe Sears Tower, according to a redirected Wikipedia page, is now the Willis Tower.\nNobody has ever heard of the Willis Tower, least of all Billie. So when she calls the next morning, rather than complain about my dirty, dusty apartment, I tell her I have a view of the Sears Tower. It rises like a black, modern monolith above the train tracks that run parallel to my street.\n\u201cImagine that,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Kay. Aside from the view, though, how is it?\u201d\nBillie is the only person left in my life who calls me Kay instead of Karen. \u201cHot,\u201d I answer. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe. It\u2019s different than the heat back\u2014\u201d I catch the word home in my teeth, and say instead, \u201cBack in Washington.\u201d\nEvery window in my apartment is open, all the ceiling fans on. I\u2019m sweating just lying on my air mattress.\nIt\u2019s quiet on her end of the line, with a slight echo, like she\u2019s speaking from the bathroom. Here it\u2019s loud. My apartment is spitting distance from the highway and the train. My walls rumble and tremble with the sounds of other people\u2019s movements.\n\u201cHuh. Well, imagine that,\u201d Billie says again.\n* * *\nThe Richard J. Daley Library, at the University of Illinois\u2013Chicago, is an ugly building on an ugly campus. It\u2019s also my new place of employment. At least it\u2019s air-conditioned.\nI recognize the older woman at the circulation desk from my video-conference interview. She\u2019s frowning down at the computer like it\u2019s left a mess on her carpet. She\u2019s still frowning when she notices me.\n\u201cHello,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKaren. The new hire.\u201d Her voice is sharp.\n\u201cYou must be Elsa,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI must be. Nobody else would put up with this shit before nine in the morning.\u201d\nI can\u2019t wait to tell Billie about this conversation.\n\u201cYou want some coffee?\u201d she offers. \u201cI could use a fresh cup.\u201d\nElsa leads me to a narrow kitchenette with a stained coffeemaker, a fridge, and stacks of books all over the floor.\nShe explains, \u201cHold piles for the staff. You\u2019ll have to shove everyone\u2019s crap around to make room for yourself. Which is a good metaphor for living in Chicago, incidentally.\u201d\nShe pours me a coffee and hands me the cup. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s been a weird morning. My soon-to-be-ex-husband sent me another drunk email last night. Writers,\u201d she sighs.\nI hear the jingle of keys and turn just as the door opens. A man enters\u2014or a boy, rather. He has a round, open face, a spindly bike balanced across his shoulder, and a huge keychain attached to a belt loop.\n\u201cMorning.\u201d He notices me. \u201cHey. You the new girl?\u201d\n\u201cThis is Karen Smith,\u201d Elsa says. \u201cShe\u2019ll be working under me in Information Services.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Patrick Lin.\u201d His front tire knocks over a pile of books as he shakes my hand. \u201cNice to meet you. Has Elsa already shown you the. . . .\u201d He makes a sweeping gesture I can\u2019t interpret. \u201cYou know. The thing?\u201d\nElsa pours her own cup of coffee. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done the tour yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh man, it\u2019s awesome,\u201d he says to me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPatrick,\u201d Elsa hisses. \u201cYou\u2019re five minutes late. Go clock in.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d He puts down the bike. Elsa squeezes out around him, and I follow her.\n\u201cNice meeting you,\u201d Patrick calls after me.\nI wave, following Elsa over to the elevators.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s Patrick,\u201d she says after the doors close. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the MLIS fellows. Nice kid.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely friendly.\u201d\nElsa snorts. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s an incurable disease.\u201d\nAll of my replies sound bitchy in my head, so I just ask, \u201cWhat was he so excited for me to see?\u201d\n* * *\nHere is the story she tells me about the name:\nOne afternoon two years ago, a student worker came running up to the circulation desk, pale and shaking. \u201cThere\u2019s a forest in the old reading room,\u201d he said. And the punch line: \u201cA literal forest.\u201d\nI smile to hide the impulse to roll my eyes.\n\u201cWe covered it with a story about a gas leak. We closed it off, and it\u2019s been permanently remodeling since,\u201d Elsa tells me.\n\u201cAnd nobody thinks that\u2019s weird?\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is Chicago,\u201d she says, as if that\u2019s supposed to mean something to me.\nI say, \u201cIf a forest pops up in a library, and nobody notices\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDoes it make a sound?\u201d Elsa finishes. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\nShe takes me through a series of halls, down a set of stairs. The walls are a beige color that\u2019s straight from 1977, the carpet red-brown. It\u2019s cooler than upstairs, damper.\nShe stops outside a door with streaks of mud on the carpet in front of it, setting her coffee down on the floor and gesturing for me to do the same. Elsa fishes an old brass key from her ring. Its bow is shiny, as if she\u2019s been worrying at it between her fingers.\nI wonder what\u2019s behind the door. A broom closet? A toilet?\nElsa opens the door and there is a forest. A literal forest.\nShe says, \u201cYou thought I was joking.\u201d\n\u201cI absolutely thought you were joking,\u201d I reply. \u201cI thought this was a prank for the new girl.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have those, too.\u201d She gestures for me to go through the door, into the forest.\nThe trees crowd closely together, their branches intertwining so thoroughly that I can\u2019t see the canopy. It\u2019s mostly deciduous trees surrounding us, interspersed with conifers. There\u2019s a thick underbrush of ferns and shrubby evergreens. The air has a familiar quality of coolness that makes me think there\u2019s water nearby. A river? A spring? I breathe in the smell of leaf mold and moss, the cool, damp air. Birds are singing. I want to fall to my knees and dig my fingers into the dirt. It smells like home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something, huh,\u201d Elsa says. \u201cAnd look at this.\u201d\nShe picks up a leaf and spreads it out in her palm. I look closer. What I took at first for veins are actually letters, tiny strings of gibberish.\nI can\u2019t think of anything to say.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the only key,\u201d Elsa says. \u201cThe door is locked at all times. I don\u2019t want any students knowing about it. I don\u2019t want some idiot freshman sneaking in on a dare and getting lost.\u201d\n\u201cLost?\u201d I say. \u201cHow big was the reading room?\u201d\n\u201cNot this big,\u201d Elsa says. \u201cI know that much.\u201d\nWe both look up, into the leaves and branches. I can\u2019t see the ceiling.\n\u201cHave you explored it?\u201d I ask. \u201cStudied it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elsa says. \u201cAnd no. Neither will you. That comes straight down from the provost. If you talk about it or come in here when I\u2019m not with you, you\u2019ll lose your position and any chance for a professorship here.\u201d\nI\u2019m still looking up at the canopy. Elsa puts a hand on my shoulder and turns me to face her. \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d\n\u201cTalk about it, get fired. Yeah.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I really haven\u2019t had enough coffee for this today.\u201d\nI put the leaf in the pocket of my slacks, hoping it won\u2019t crumble before I can take it home.\nShe doesn\u2019t mention the forest again, and keeps me by her side for the next four hours. Just as I\u2019m sliding into a low-blood-sugar stupor, she tells me to go eat lunch.\nIn the break room, I pull out my copy of Thoreau\u2019s Walden with my sandwich. It\u2019s the only book I have that\u2019s not packed away or in storage. I carried it with me as I drove a U-Haul east to Chicago, read it in rest stops and motel rooms. It was probably an act of masochism to be reading about life in the woods as I moved to a big city. Seems ironic now, or prescient.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a few hours ago, I stood in a dark, impossible forest, stuffed inside an unused room in the middle of the city. I wish I could show Billie. She\u2019d want to explore it immediately.\nI wish I could show my father. The thought hits me sideways, out of nowhere, and it hurts. It always does.\n\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d\nPatrick\u2019s voice startles me. He\u2019s holding a Tupperware container and a worn paperback. Its cover is laughably bad, floating eyeballs and galaxies and improbably dressed women. It looks like it was written by someone who\u2019s fluent in more than one Star Trek language.\nI hold my book in front of my face. \u201cThoreau. Walden.\u201d\n\u201cWalden,\u201d he repeats. \u201cCool. Do you like Thoreau?\u201d\n\u201cI like how he writes about solitude,\u201d I say, hoping he\u2019ll take a hint and let me eat in silence.\nHe doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhat does he write about solitude?\u201d\nThat it\u2019s better company than other people, I think. But Billie expressly forbade me from being rude to my coworkers on my first day, so instead, I say nothing at all.\nPatrick clears his throat and opens up his Tupperware, dumping its contents into a bowl and sliding it into the microwave. \u201cSo you saw it?\u201d he asks in a low voice. \u201cThe old reading room?\u201d\nI put down my book and think of the leaf in my pocket, with its veins that aren\u2019t veins but words.\n\u201cHow did Elsa expect me to pay attention to anything else after showing me that?\u201d I say.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to knowing it\u2019s there,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cI did, anyway. It\u2019s cool and all, but it\u2019s not like I see it all the time. Hardly ever, actually.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Elsa lead field trips or something in there? I thought she had the only key.\u201d\nThe microwave dings. I keep quiet, waiting, as Patrick fusses with his food.\nPatrick whispers, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the only key.\u201d\nI stare at him.\n\u201cIf Elsa finds out, she\u2019ll fire me. And she\u2019s on my thesis committee, so I\u2019ll fail. Keep it to yourself, okay?\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d I take a bite of my sandwich. Try desperately to think of something else to talk about. \u201cSo. You like . . . biking?\u201d\nPatrick relaxes. \u201cOh, yeah. Chicago\u2019s great to bike in. You just have to watch out for the cabs. And the pedestrians. And the potholes. And the buses. You should come on a ride with me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a bike,\u201d I say.\n\u201cMy roommate has, like, five. One of his will probably fit you. What are you doing Saturday?\u201d\nI open my mouth to make an excuse, but what pops out is, \u201cI\u2019ll go on a bike ride with you if you take me back into the forest.\u201d\nPatrick, panicked, looks around to make sure nobody heard. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cJust a quick trip, though. And not right away.\u201d\n* * *\nI call Billie when I get back to my apartment.\n\u201cHow was your first day?\u201d she asks.\nI lie back on my air mattress. The apartment building trembles as a train goes by.\n\u201cMore interesting than I thought it would be,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWhat a thing to say,\u201d Billie grumbles. \u201cAbout the least informative answer you could give.\u201d\nI can\u2019t tell her about the forest\u2014even if it wasn\u2019t grounds for termination, she\u2019d never believe me\u2014so I tell her, \u201cThere\u2019s this one guy at the library. He\u2019s kind of a dork. He invited me to go on a bike ride with him.\u201d\n\u201cOh, a bike ride? Is that what the kids call it these days?\u201d\nI groan. \u201cDon\u2019t, Billie. I\u2019m not even a little interested in him like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to get back on that horse someday,\u201d says Billie.\nAwkward silence. I dumped my last boyfriend when my dad got his terminal diagnosis. I haven\u2019t been interested in dating since.\nI listen to Billie breathe, and she listens to me. We\u2019re both waiting for each other to speak.\nShe asks, \u201cIs it still hotter than hell there?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Still having a cool spell?\u201d\n\u201cCan hardly call this summer,\u201d Billie grumbles.\n* * *\nBy the end of the week, I can find my way around the library. So it\u2019s no accident that I wind up downstairs on the east side of the building, retracing the path that Elsa took me on the first day. Last night, I dreamed that I was following a river that led deeper and deeper into the forest.\nHere is a thing I don\u2019t tell most people: I got lost in the woods once, when I was young. Billie is\u2014was\u2014my father\u2019s sister, and when my mom died, he sent me to spend a few weeks out at her place. I was thirteen.\nBillie\u2019s property in Bellingham abuts a state forest. I wandered into it one day, and stayed there for seven hours before I stumbled back out into the road and hitched a ride back to Billie\u2019s. The drive took only about fifteen minutes.\nBillie shouted at me for scaring her, then made me soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. I went to bed while the last of the evening light disappeared, my mind still wandering amid the trees until sleep took me.\nYears later, I told my father. He said, \u201cI always wondered if something happened. You seemed different when you came back.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer, just said, \u201cI figured it was because of your mother. Losing a parent changes a person.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cNice place,\u201d Patrick tells me on Saturday morning. He\u2019s brought an old Schwinn with him, and he adjusts the seat and brakes for me while I stand awkwardly by his side.\n\u201cHow long has it been since you rode a bike?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\nHe looks skeptical. \u201cWe\u2019ll go for a short ride.\u201d\nThe short ride is still longer than any that I\u2019ve ever been on, and more terrifying. We ride on the street, cars driving alongside us, music thumping through their windows. It\u2019s a relief when we turn off the main road onto shady neighborhood streets.\nEventually we arrive at a little park in Chinatown that\u2019s hemmed in by the river on one side and rows of brick duplexes on the other. There\u2019s a red gate with Chinese characters painted on it in gold, and a pavilion. It\u2019s mostly deserted, save for a few old men fanning themselves. The river is sedate, lazy from days of no rain.\n\u201cThis is one of my favorite places in the city,\u201d Patrick says. I can see why.\nLooking south over the river, there\u2019s the oddest bridge. There are two turrets on each bank, straight and made of steel. Connecting them is a big arch with what looks like a tiny house in the center of it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask, nodding at it.\nPatrick follows my gaze. \u201cI think it\u2019s a drawbridge. The arch goes up and down.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the house in the middle?\u201d\nPatrick smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just where the controls are.\u201d\nMaybe there are controls for the bridge, but maybe there\u2019s something else, hidden behind the sooty door. Something secret and strange and impossible, an entire microcosm hidden away. If a library can have a forest, who knows what could be hidden in a house in the middle of a bridge?\n* * *\n\u201cTell me more about this boy,\u201d Billie says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really not much to tell,\u201d I answer. \u201cHe shouted at some asshole who catcalled me while we were biking and then took me to a park by the river.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like love,\u201d she sighs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want love,\u201d I say.\n\u201cEveryone wants to be loved,\u201d Billie says.\nI let silence and static fill up the miles between us. I don\u2019t want to be loved. Not like she\u2019s thinking.\n\u201cOh, Kay, don\u2019t listen to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI just worry about you, all alone out there.\u201d\n\u201cThere are three million people in Chicago, Billie, I couldn\u2019t be alone if I tried.\u201d Even now, I can hear people talking loudly in the alley behind my apartment, cars and trucks on the freeway, busses on the street. There\u2019s a child crying in an apartment below me, and a couple arguing above.\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Billie says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could put up with it, myself.\u201d\nI lie back on my air mattress. I imagine Billie\u2019s house, nestled among the tall cedars. There, you only hear the trees creaking and the crows and jays. Wind. Leaves. Songbirds in the morning and at dusk.\nHomesickness is an odd feeling. Every part of you curls up like a dried leaf.\nI confess, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can, either.\u201d\nWe breathe in sync despite the mountains and miles between us.\nBillie says, \u201cKay, I know it was hard on you when your dad died.\u201d\nI suck in a breath. We don\u2019t talk about him. Dad got sick suddenly but died slowly, and it was hard and awful and the worst year of my life.\n\u201cSo?\u201d I say to Billie. It comes out harsher than I intended.\n\u201cSo I thought getting away from here might be good for you. That\u2019s why I told you that you should take the job and go to Chicago. And you know he would have wanted you to take it.\u201d\nI\u2019m glad that my apartment is dark. I don\u2019t think I could hear this in daylight, or under the glare of a sixty-watt bulb.\n\u201cI should let you go,\u201d I say.\n\u201cKay\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI love you. Bye.\u201d\n* * *\nThe leaf from the forest is paper-thin. I hold it carefully by the stem, trying to read the lines of letters that march up and across its ribs.\nWhen the pain got bad, Dad liked to go to the back deck or window and watch the trees. He said it calmed him, staring up at the leaves as they swayed in the wind.\nWashington\u2019s Death with Dignity law has been on the books since 2008. I voted for the law during the election. My dad voted against it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing finer minds prevailed,\u201d he joked when he told me what he wanted, the day we asked the doctor for the pentobarbital prescription. My dad was never any good at telling jokes.\nHe died in Billie\u2019s backyard, wrapped in a blanket and sitting in a lawn chair, face tilted toward the crowns of the cedars, which were catching the last light of the day.\nWe spread his ashes in the bay. Billie\u2019s neighbor took us out until the town receded to a thin line on the lip of the water. I dumped the ashes off the leeward side of the boat.\n\u201cThere he goes,\u201d Billie said, as they spread out in the water and sank. \u201cHe\u2019s free, now.\u201d\nThere aren\u2019t many trees on my block. I have to close my eyes to see leaves and branches, shifting back and forth in the wind. When I open them, there\u2019s only a tiny dried leaf in my hand, strings of knotted letters making up its veins. A tiny, mysterious memento.\n* * *\n\u201cSo it\u2019s been a week.\u201d Elsa leans against my desk, ever-present cup of coffee in one hand. \u201cHow are you adjusting?\u201d\n\u201cTo the job?\u201d I say. \u201cI think I\u2019m doing pretty well.\u201d I rest my hand on the stack of new books I\u2019ve successfully wrestled into the Library of Congress cataloging system.\n\u201cHow about to the rest of it?\u201d she asks.\nThe heat was unbearable last night. I barely slept. I kept thinking of the forest: the cool shade and the smooth trunks, the river or spring that I\u2019m inexplicably sure is there.\nIf a forest pops up in a library, and nobody talks about it, does it make a sound?\nI tell Elsa, \u201cI\u2019m doing okay.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll get easier when the students come back,\u201d Elsa says. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep you busy. It won\u2019t feel like such a ghost town.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be good. Busy is good.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019ll storm soon. That should cool things down.\u201d\nThe storm blows in a few days later, while I\u2019m at the library. The rain comes down so hard that sheets of water slap at the window. Thunder rattles the windows and my bones. I\u2019ve never seen such a storm. I\u2019m terrified, but I can\u2019t move away from the window. Lightning forks down from the sky, burning white. The sky is a sickly color, orange-green-gray.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Patrick says.\nI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re always in each other\u2019s orbits at work. Well, maybe I know: he likes me, and I haven\u2019t tried to learn anyone else\u2019s name just yet.\nI ask, \u201cIs this normal?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cAren\u2019t there storms like this in Washington?\u201d\n\u201cNot my part of it.\u201d\nThe rain falls and falls, until all at once, it tapers off to a manageable drizzle. Outside, the streets are flooded with puddles inches deep, lapping over the edges of the sidewalks. Leaves and branches litter the ground, torn from trees by the wind and water.\nThe rain keeps up for most of the night. The soothing sound of it muffles the rest of the city\u2019s clamor.\nThe next morning, I don\u2019t wake up in a pool of sweat. For the first time since I moved, I think I might be able to stay.\n* * *\nPatrick invites me to a bar in the neighborhood. It\u2019s dim and dark inside, with a pool table in the back and a pinball machine. Soul music snakes out of the speakers above the bar.\nThe bartender recognizes Patrick, asks him how his thesis is going. He asks if I\u2019m \u201cthe new girl.\u201d\nPatrick\u2019s blushing. I shrug and say I started last week, then ask for a bottle of Pabst, which is the only thing I recognize on the menu. Patrick asks for his \u201cusual,\u201d and the bartender moves away.\n\u201cI may have mentioned you to Carlos,\u201d he says self-consciously.\nI consider pressing him about what he said. Instead, I ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s your thesis about, anyway?\u201d\nPatrick seems relieved by the change of topic. \u201cImmigration narratives in science fiction, and how it ties into outreach into immigrant communities.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. That\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d I say, surprised.\nHe smiles. \u201cI was a geeky kid. I was always into the idea of new worlds. And my grandparents were from Hong Kong. I used to dream about what their journey would have been like.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanted to explore new worlds, but you don\u2019t want to go back to the forest?\u201d I ask.\nI didn\u2019t think that it had been on my mind, but I can\u2019t forget the feeling of that air against my skin, the cool shade, the trunks of those impossible trees.\nPatrick looks into his drink, stirs it with the narrow straw, and doesn\u2019t answer. My stomach sinks a little.\n\u201cDo you actually have a key?\u201d I say. \u201cOr were you just trying to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d Patrick says, indignant. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014I\u2019m not an explorer. I\u2019m a librarian. Or I\u2019m going to be, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAre they mutually exclusive?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not for some people,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.\nHe\u2019s quiet for a long moment, and when he does answer, he doesn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cI did go in once, after I got the key. I was gonna stay the night, whole weekend maybe. I brought a sleeping bag, a tent, food. But when I got in there, and I shut the door behind me. . . .\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing happened. I just\u2014I freaked out over how dark it was.\u201d\nDon\u2019t laugh, I tell myself, and bite my lip until the impulse passes. Then I really think about it. The woods around Billie\u2019s house are dark even during the day, and at night, the darkness eats the light of fires and flashlights, cuts it into ribbons, diminishes it to nothing within a dozen yards.\nIn the city, even alleys have lights shining in them. Light bounces off the clouds, precipitates down from the air. How would the darkness of the forest feel to someone who was used to that?\n\u201cAnother drink?\u201d Patrick asks, looking desperate to talk about anything else.\n\u201cSure. Tell me more about immigration narratives in science fiction.\u201d\nWe drink and play pinball and talk about postcolonial space operas and intergalactic refugees until midnight. Patrick walks me home, pushing his bike, expounding on Islamophobia in medievalist high fantasy. He gives me a one-armed hug at the gate of my apartment building.\n\u201cYou smell good,\u201d he mumbles into my hair.\n\u201cUh,\u201d I say.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Patrick says, and pulls away from me. \u201cI just mean. You smell like . . . somewhere. Elsewhere.\u201d\nI stare at him.\n\u201cSomewhere else,\u201d he tries. \u201cLike mountains. Sorry. That\u2019s creepy.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a little.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m drunk,\u201d he confesses.\n\u201cI know.\u201d I am too.\n\u201cI guess I was trying to impress you,\u201d he says in a rush. \u201cWhen I told you I had a key to the forest. You just\u2014when you talked about it, you seemed so different, and before you\u2019d been all. . . .\u201d\nHe looks at me like I might be able to help him find a descriptor. I can think of a few: standoffish, aloof, bitchy, lonely, friendless, orphaned.\n\u201cI have a massive crush on you,\u201d he says. Which I knew, but hearing him say it feels a little like being pushed down a flight of stairs.\nHe waits, but I can\u2019t think of anything else to say.\n\u201cOkay. Well. I\u2019m gonna . . . yeah. See you at work tomorrow,\u201d he says. He looks mortified. I probably do too.\nI blurt out, \u201cMaybe we can go for another bike ride this weekend.\u201d\n\u201cThat . . . that would be cool,\u201d he says. He mounts his bike in one fluid movement and flees.\nOn the air mattress that night, I listen to the traffic moving on the nearby freeway, like blood moving through a giant artery. I wonder if it\u2019s possible to make a life like I had in Washington, before my father died last year, before I stopped talking to all my friends, and everything in me went toward going to classes and doing homework and not crawling into the woods like a wounded animal to die.\nI think of the forest hidden behind a door in the library. If it happened there\u2014a forest unfurling and spreading through a single room in a single building, transforming bound books into tree trunks and ferns\u2014could it happen anywhere? Are there other pockets where the wilderness has intruded onto the orderly architecture of a city of stone and concrete?\nI think of the forest that swallowed me for seven hours when I was thirteen. That was more than half my life ago, but some days it feels like I just stumbled into my borrowed room at Billie\u2019s, and I\u2019m watching the light recede from the trees and the darkness emerge. Some days I feel like it\u2019s waiting until I\u2019m ready to come back.\n* * *\nHere is what Patrick says when he shows up at my apartment for our bike ride, after two days of terrible awkwardness at work:\n\u201cCan we just forget that I\u2019m an idiot and that I made things weird?\u201d\nPeople in Washington never talk this way. It\u2019s a surprise, but not a bad one. I tell him, \u201cOkay. We can do that.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cBike ride?\u201d\nWe bike downtown, where the buildings glint in the sunlight, hard metal and cement. Patrick goes faster than he did last time, like he wants me to work to keep up with him. We go underneath Lake Shore Drive, and Lake Michigan stretches out in front of us.\nI always forget about the lake. Chicago is laid out on a grid, so rigidly angled that you sometimes forget that the earth underneath your feet is a gentle curve, defying generations of cartographers and their deflated two-dimensional maps. The lake is the only place where the land has its natural contours.\nThe bike path is crowded, the beach even more so. That doesn\u2019t stop us from rolling up our pants legs and wading into the water.\n\u201cYou used to live by the ocean, right?\u201d Patrick says.\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cWas it. . . . Was it like this at all?\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever been?\u201d I ask, though I\u2019m already sure of his answer. \u201cTo the ocean, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nI look at the warm water swirling around my ankles and tell him, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like this.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, and I understand that he was trying to give me something. I wish I knew how to tell him I appreciate the thought without sounding so condescending. Around us, kids shriek and splash each other, teenagers sunbathe on towels, families pass around drinks from coolers. It\u2019s not so peaceful, but it\u2019s where we are.\n\u201cI do like it here,\u201d I say, and Patrick smiles a little.\nWe ride back the way we came. I think I\u2019m starting to like biking in the city. It\u2019s extreme meditation. The repetitive motion of my legs, the way my weight melds with that of the bicycle: it\u2019s calming, not the way that watching the leaves was, but it sweeps the city\u2019s jangling discordance out of my head.\nI\u2019m looking up ahead at Patrick, and not to my right, so the pedestrian coming out between the cars takes me completely by surprise. I swerve into the road, hear a loud honking, swerve again, and collide with a parked car, and I fall and fall for a long time.\nI think of the way my father\u2019s ashes fell into the water, pouring from the wooden box in my hands, drifting on the wind before they landed, then sinking piecemeal below the surface.\nBefore my father died, we went to the beach often. When my mother was still alive, she didn\u2019t share his and my fascination. She\u2019d shake her head as we hurried her along, and say, \u201cIt\u2019s the same ocean it was yesterday, what\u2019s there to get excited about?\u201d\nIt\u2019s always the same ocean, but it\u2019s never the one you saw yesterday, or last week, or the day you dumped your father\u2019s ashes into the gray water. It\u2019s always there, and it\u2019s itself. The ocean I left last month is not the one in my memory, and not the one that exists today, far away from me.\nThat\u2019s the difference between the ocean and this lake, even if the horizon sits at the elbows of both.\nThere\u2019s noise. There are people gathered around me. Patrick is swearing. The woman I almost hit on my bike is crying.\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m probably not.\nPatrick tells me, \u201cThe ambulance is on its way, so don\u2019t move. Karen. Don\u2019t move, okay?\u201d\nIt occurs to me to tell him that my friends called me Kay, when I still had friends. Before my father was diagnosed, I was good at having friends. I lost the knack and nickname by the time he died.\nOpening my mouth again makes me want to throw up. So instead, I let Patrick lean me against a parked car, and I breathe steady through my nose, trying not to gag at the smell of hot asphalt, exhaust, and my own blood dripping down my face.\n* * *\nHere is why I got lost in the woods at thirteen: a combination of stupidity and the desire to be found. I wanted to know that people would look for me. I suspected they wouldn\u2019t. My mother had died in a car accident. My father had shipped me off to my aunt\u2019s house while he dealt with his grief over Mom\u2019s death. Billie was a near stranger, taciturn and quiet.\nSo I wandered into the forest. I kept going farther in, and then I looked around and realized that I had no idea what way I\u2019d come.\nWhen I was lost, time didn\u2019t really matter. I didn\u2019t have a watch, and I couldn\u2019t see the sun to mark its passage across the sky. Not until it was nearly setting, and then it occurred to me that the forest bordered the highway on its western edge.\nDid I want to stay the night in the woods? Did I want to stay lost?\nSelfishly, I did. But I trudged out west anyway, continuing to walk even as it got dark around me, hoping I\u2019d stay on track enough to get to the road.\n* * *\nI hate hospitals. They smell like slow death.\n\u201cKaren wanted me to tell you that she\u2019s okay,\u201d Patrick says into my phone. \u201cShe wanted me to tell you that first off. She\u2019s all right.\u201d\nI\u2019m lying on my side while the doctor cleans the gravel out of my shoulder. My head hurts too much to have Billie\u2019s long-distance worry delivered right into my ear. Concussion. My doctor scolded me for not wearing a helmet, and I made a special effort to throw up on her. She was too quick for me, though.\n\u201cShe wants to talk to you,\u201d Patrick says, holding out the phone.\n\u201cBillie,\u201d I say, loud enough that my voice should reach her. \u201cI\u2019m concussed and miserable. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d\nIt was a bad idea to call Billie from the emergency room. She hates hospitals just as much as I do.\n\u201cShe still doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019re really alive,\u201d says Patrick.\n\u201cTake a picture and send it to her,\u201d I reply.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Patrick asks. \u201cYou don\u2019t look too great right now.\u201d\nI don\u2019t care how I look. \u201cDo it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the fake sound of an imaginary shutter.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna apologize now,\u201d he says into the phone. \u201cBut she insisted.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Elsa says the next morning.\n\u201cBike accident,\u201d I explain. The painkillers make me feel slow and stupid.\n\u201cPatrick told me what happened,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you need time off to recuperate?\u201d\nI blink at her. Patrick insisted that I sleep at his house, in his bed, in case I needed anything. His bed was comfier than my air mattress, but I still slept terribly. Patrick seemed appalled when I told him that I was going into work. He must have called Elsa while I was on my way here.\n\u201cI feel okay,\u201d I lie. \u201cBesides, this place is air-conditioned.\u201d\nElsa purses her lips. \u201cYour work ethic is admirable. Still, you should go home. Take the week off and go easy on yourself.\u201d\nI nod, and wince. Most of the muscles in my neck and back hurt.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you a cab, too. It\u2019s hot out there today,\u201d Elsa says.\n* * *\nMy apartment is heating up again. I look up the weather for the next week and want to cry when I see the heat index creep up to one hundred as the week goes on.\nMy phone rings. It\u2019s Billie.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say instead of hello. \u201cI didn\u2019t die of a concussion during the night.\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn it, Kay,\u201d Billie says. \u201cYou scared the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, really.\u201d\n\u201cDid you even look at that photo you sent me?\u201d\n\u201cI sent you a photo?\u201d I ask, then remember. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell are you riding a bike in that city, anyway? I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t get run over sooner.\u201d\nThere are only so many ways to reassure Billie that I\u2019m bruised but not completely broken, and I try them all.\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d is how she responds. \u201cI hate that you\u2019re so far away and I can\u2019t make sure you\u2019re all right myself.\u201d\n\u201cI am, though,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d\n\u201cI spent all last night looking up flights to Chicago.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I groan. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. Besides, there\u2019s another heat wave coming, you don\u2019t want to be here right now. I don\u2019t want to be here right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou can always come back,\u201d Billie says.\nI try to get some words out around the heavy stone of homesickness that\u2019s materialized in my throat. Nothing comes.\n\u201cForget I said that,\u201d Billie says quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just. . . .\u201d\n\u201cWell, whatever you are, I am too,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go back, I haven\u2019t even been gone a month yet.\u201d\nBillie doesn\u2019t say anything to that. I listen to the static, the humming of the thousands of miles between us.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can come visit me someday. Maybe in the fall. Or the winter.\u201d\n\u201cThe winter? I\u2019m not coming out to Chicago in the winter, I hear they\u2019re the worst.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a cheerful thought. \u201cSpring, then. At the latest,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI am proud, you know,\u201d Billie says, and the way her voice breaks is what makes me cry. \u201cYour father would be, too. You\u2019re the bravest girl I know.\u201d\n* * *\nBut I\u2019m not brave. I\u2019m desperate. The temperature is climbing, and I\u2019m stuck in my apartment with a fractured arm, a concussion, and a dwindling supply of painkillers. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night, just fall into a thin doze like a fever dream. The literal forest intruded into my imagination, and the rumbling of passing trains and trucks became an earthquake as trees cracked through the foundations of my building, shooting up through the floor. Only it wasn\u2019t the forest I remembered, but a sticky, hot jungle, and I stumbled through it, desperate to find the river I knew existed.\nPatrick\u2019s in the bathroom, and he\u2019s left his keys on the kitchen counter with a bag of groceries he brought over. My fingers tremble as I look for a key that matches the one I saw in Elsa\u2019s hand.\nThere are two keys that have the same bow Elsa\u2019s did. They look newly copied, untarnished and smooth. Which could mean nothing. He might keep the key hidden away in his apartment somewhere. He might have thrown it out.\nI get the two keys off the ring and tuck them in my sling, dropping the other keys back on the counter just before Patrick comes out of the bathroom.\nDid he hear me?\nPatrick smiles tiredly at me and asks if I want dinner.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I say.\nPatrick picks up his key ring and clips it to his belt, not noticing the change in its weight.\n* * *\nI tell myself I\u2019ll only go for an hour. Maybe two. One night, at the most, just to get away from the heat.\nIf a librarian disappears into a forest, and she doesn\u2019t make a sound, will anyone notice?\nThe campus is still empty of students. I can hear the noise of the city, though, the perpetual hum of nearly three million people, all of them talking over each other, listening to music, laughing, drinking, coughing, sobbing. Somewhere in the noise, Elsa is typing out an angry email to her drunk ex-husband. Somewhere else, Patrick is sitting in his apartment, writing his thesis. Maybe he\u2019s wishing he hadn\u2019t told me about his crush. Or maybe he\u2019s wishing that he had kissed me. Or maybe he\u2019s not thinking of me at all, but of another world, and the journey it would take to get there.\nI think of a river that I only saw in a dream. If a forest can be in a library, if books can be transformed into trees and ferns, a river isn\u2019t impossible. There are so many possibilities, but nobody has mapped a single one.\nThe library is quieter at night, the silence as stifling as the heat outside. I lock the door behind me and walk through the foyer, down the stairs, through the hallways where the air is muggy and still. Soon enough, I\u2019m standing in front of a door. I pull the two keys out of my sling, where I\u2019ve kept them since this afternoon, pressed against my skin.\nThe first one slides into the lock but doesn\u2019t turn.\nThe second one gives a little and, when I jiggle it, slides the tumblers free. I push the door open, and cool air washes over me. The noise of the city is muted, and I can hear birdsong, something beautiful and melodic. Maybe someone left a book by Coleridge or Keats in here when the forest happened, and it transformed into something winged and singing. What else is in here? What kind of ecosystem sprang from the inked words of authors\u2019 imaginations?\nI step inside and pull the door closed shut.

Object appears to have sustained repeated water damage. Many pages are damaged\/incomplete. An unidentified opalescent substance obscures portions of the remaining text. Transcription ongoing.]\n11th of First Month, 3E 45\nAs I consider drowning a preferable alternative to most College lectures\u2014let alone the one I\u2019d been obliged to provide this morning\u2014falling through the Wellspring ice on my way to the hall proved a happy surprise and a fascinating experience. Unfortunately, my unexpected mid-winter exploration of a magical monument quite panicked certain members of the administration, and I was forced to waste the better part of my day to College-sanctioned warming spells and their pitiful attempt at \u201cmeasuring observable aftereffects.\u201d I am only now able to write. Ancestors willing, I haven\u2019t misplaced any memories of significance.\nFirst, despite the season, I perceived no discernable temperature beneath the ice. In fact, I hesitate to use the word perceived at all. The \u201cwater\u201d\u2014bearing little more than a passing resemblance to the substance\u2014parted around me without weight or form, leaving only the impression of static on my skin.\nSecondly, in swallowing some, I found the taste an ungainly cacophony of sensation neither sweet nor foul, but altogether strange. It struck me as crystalline, somehow\u2014reminded me of Grandmother Arvel\u2019s quartz garden, fresh-summoned stones channeling ground magic into her spellwork.\nFurthermore, it tasted of a heartbeat. I felt the pulse of it on my tongue, the suggestion of some dark thing, ancient and perfumed. Whatever substance comprises this \u201clake,\u201d one can hardly call it water.\nAlready an incongruous report, to be sure. I smile to think someday soon I will place this description within a proper dissertation. Here, the keen intellects of the College hierarchy will flutter and froth, wracking themselves over implications and \u201cimpossibilities.\u201d And yet, kind as I am, I will do our exceedingly competent administration one better\u2014\nBeneath, I saw a figure.\nDespite the perfect clarity of the Wellspring water, sunlight pierces the icy surface in laced and fractal patterns, making precision difficult. I am certain only that the creature possessed a human shape and moved with purposeful intent. This was no floating corpse; it held itself in the water as swimmers do.\nIt watched me.\nUnfortunately, someone fetched a groundskeeper to haul me up before I could examine it closer, and an eternity of forced infirmary followed. I am afraid I may have forgotten important details in the long interim between experience and record. I hesitate to write more in case the finer points of my recollection may be incorrect.\nI will only say that I am reminded of a local story, a drowned woman living within the Wellspring. If such a story is true\u2014if a woman fell into the water and survived her death\u2014then she is the first successful lich to my (extensive) knowledge in several hundred years.\nWith so many necromantic records and rituals destroyed in the Ancestor War, I can hardly pass up such an opportunity.\n* * *\n[Item 2: a page torn from Local Legends of Elverum, later determined to belong to the copy held at the College of Applied Magicks\u2019 library.

Paper carries lingering scent of perfume and damp.]\n* * *\n[Item 1-2, ongoing transcription.]\n19th of First Month, 3E 45\nThe lich attempted to curse me today. The silly beast floated up and took a fingernail to the underside of the ice, sketching out a nasty hex I haven\u2019t seen since my brother and I were young, chasing about with pockets of little torments and perpetually curse-bloody mouths.\nAn old spell, I grant you, but one any reasonably intelligent child could deflect\u2014at least, any reasonably intelligent child from home. Certainly I had worse in my repertoire as a girl. Political practice is best begun young, after all.\nConsidering the strength and heft of my personal wards, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed her making trouble at all had I not heard the scratching. A rather disappointing showing, all things told. If I\u2019m to be cursed by a lich, I would have it done properly or not at all.\nI told her as much, through a hole I cut in the ice. Used mages\u2019 sign, given the difficulty in hearing anything underwater. Watching me, she became quite excited, though her own communication is poor. The lich makes her point in hammer strikes, having lost much of the dexterity in her fingers to either reanimation or disuse.\nStill, with the particular blue-black tint of her skin and some of her flourishes, I suspect she must hail from the North as well. Certainly few enough spellworkers here know a proper sign, and even butchered, I recognized several of hers as an old dialect from the mountains.\nFrom what I can gather, she wants to beg a favor. She signed, \u201cKin?\u201d indicating a few shared knots in our familial braids, and then went on to sign, \u201cHelp,\u201d pressing her hand flat against the surface of the water. Though I\u2019d cut away the ice, she could not reach through. Some barrier exists around the Wellspring, preventing her leaving.\nI admit, I am exceedingly intrigued.\nI have many questions, none of which she could answer in her limited fashion, but she indicated I should look beneath the College proper. Judging by the little maps she sketched on the under-surface of the ice, it would seem the current College was built above the wreckage of another. The lich drew several diagrams for me (copied quickly to the next page) where she believed I might find access to the tunnels below. She is confident that such tunnels exist, says she can \u201chear the hollow\u201d and that \u201cwellspring roots run deep.\u201d\nAt least, I presume she said wellspring. The sign she used reads closer to the vague, encompassing gesture of \u201cthis mess.\u201d Regardless, I expect to find some sort of access within the cellars or storerooms. If not, I\u2019m certain it will not pose much trouble to fashion my own. A few mountain spells and this human stonework crumbles into sand at a breath. If I cannot work quietly, I shall settle for quickly. Regardless, I will see what lies beneath.\n[The following page contains three rough sketches\u2014one a recognizable depiction of the College undercroft\u2014and a note scrawled in the upper right margin.]\nI left my watery friend a page of local folklore on the \u201cWoman in the Wellspring.\u201d Just a bit of tourist rubbish from the College library\u2019s vast selection of trash, but were I in her position, I\u2019d be interested in knowing how my legend had faired. Perhaps she will enjoy it.\n* * *\n[Item 3: Letter from the Dean of Mages, dated 20th of First Month, 3E 45]\nDear Hanarai Arvel,\nAccording to our records, we have yet to receive your proof of publication for the recently ended year, 3E 44. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that funding and College resources (including library and grounds access, experimental grants, and room and board) are provided based on contribution to the magical community.\nGiven the nature of your research, I understand the difficulties in maintaining a tenable publication schedule. However, as we have discussed many times, all inquiries must eventually bear flowers or fruit.\nUnderstand that while I consider your intellect an asset to the College, your continual disregard of regulation cannot be tolerated. Please submit your most current findings to the board by month\u2019s end or I shall have to issue a discontinuation of residence and service.\nYour cooperation is appreciated,\nEthelinde Tallow\nDean of Mages\n* * *\n[Item 4: a small packet of water-stained pages. Much of the document is badly damaged, but restoration has so far proved a moderate success. Recovered portions suggest the text comprises the main body of Arvel\u2019s research paper. Transcription ongoing.]\n. . . research conducted beneath the Elverum Wellspring, located within the grounds of the College of Applied Magicks.\nDespite apparent efforts, accurate maps detailing the wellspring\u2019s boundaries (even the above-ground portion) have yet to exist. Fluctuations in the fabric of measurable perception increase exponentially in direct proportion to viewer proximity, thereby rendering existent methods of mathematical fixation inaccurate (Luana 35). Given the impossibility of pinning any event here to a singular \u201ctruth,\u201d all research within the confines of the Wellspring is by necessity unconventional and potentially irreproducible. Ashmoore confronts this difficulty in her recent paper, \u201cOn the Liminality of Natural Spellwork,\u201d writing:\nPerhaps best known for its opalescent glow, the Elverum Wellspring\u2019s water has been winter harvested and used in lieu of oil lamps throughout the College as far back as the Second Era. Though technically frozen, this substance cannot be called \u2018ice\u2019 except in the loosest of terms, existing simultaneously as solid, liquid, and gaseous matter. As the \u2018ice\u2019 burns\/melts, it fluctuates rapidly within the confines of measurable perception, emitting a steady light of indeterminate color; the scent of lilac and black mold; and, in several reports, \u201can indistinct female voice shaping ancient spells.\u201d It is therefore difficult to classify anything related to the wellspring in such limited terms as \u201cfactual\u201d and \u201cfantastical,\u201d when even the water itself exists simultaneously in several incongruous states. (203)\nConsequently, while studying any events related to the Wellspring, researchers must suspend disbelief in order to allow for the most complete (and therefore accurate) perception of events. As with any complex working, the particular undefined quality of a magical occurrence relays crucial information about its source of energy\u2014and, subsequently, a mage\u2019s ability to tap said source in augmentation of their own power.\n* * *\n[Item 1-3, ongoing transcription.]\n23rd of First Month, 3E 45\nFinally beneath. Between fielding the dean\u2019s fanatical publication crusade and locating an entrance, what an utterly irritating labyrinth I navigated to reach here.\nFor all the passages my watery friend scratched into the ice, I found every one sealed over in spells and stone but the last: a minimally barricaded corridor off the lowest store cellar. Typical human oversight, to expend such effort hiding halls as though they\u2019d never been, only to bar this one behind little more than potato crates.\nAs tempting as it would have been to spell myself a path, as ever, subtlety makes the better servant. Many so-called mages here run \u201cexperiments\u201d tracking fluctuations within ground magic currents. As I\u2019d prefer a herd of idiots not come thundering through with homemade barometers ablaze, I forwent levitation for an hour\u2019s worth of physical labor. One never knows who might be listening.\nSo far, my pains have proved promising. I expected to find nothing\u2014or else, to find a few hollow ruins, an interesting foundation upon which to build a school of study, but one ultimately empty save for a few odd bones and the detritus of passing years.\nInstead, every room remains full with furniture. Tapestries hang on the walls, singed and fragile with dry-rot but otherwise intact. Fallen chairs wait at well-carved tables. Open books strew most available surfaces, scattered notes littering the floor. In fact, I write this now at a proper desk, atop some stranger\u2019s panicked research, the lamp at my side easily relit, dry and clean, if obsolete.\nThrowing up desperate walls to seal this place, trapping a fortune\u2019s worth of library behind them\u2014whatever happened here terrified these mages. They\u2019d not have abandoned such books and treasures otherwise.\nAnd the walls! Everywhere I walk, I find heavy rune-work gashed into the stone, a hasty ward system built into the wreckage itself. A quick perusal of the corridors suggests a massive compound, once occupying the entire breadth of the wellspring. Only the outermost wheel still stands today. Given that every inward-facing hall has since been barricaded with broken stone and sloppy spells, I would wager this wheel runs around the wellspring.\nThe apparently sudden onset of the wellspring makes an exciting enough prospect on its own, but walking the halls, these runes\u2014they\u2019re not right. Studying the sketches I made traveling the circumference, I found mistakes in the runic lines. These long-dead mages unknowingly altered their intended spell. Given its language, I believe they intended to imprison the lich, and in that they succeeded. But the way they wove their runes\u2014the way my watery friend must have battered her prison\u2014all that spell runoff had nowhere to dissipate. It collected, the trap\u2019s raw power caught within itself, within two hundred years of simple rainwater, exponentially perpetuating.\nA misplacement of source-runes and somehow, they created a self-fueling spell. It explains everything: the simultaneous and conflicting states of the water; its lack of perceptible temperature; its taste of garden quartz. The wellspring isn\u2019t a spring at all\u2014it\u2019s a curse.\nI\u2019ve diagrammed the area once already, marking each rune and its relative location. I intend to make several more such maps for surety\u2019s sake. When I destroy the spell, I wish to be certain I can replicate it.\nUntil then, I\u2019m headed off to raid every desk and dresser here. I would dearly love to know exactly which ward these mages intended, how much they understood of the thing they created.\nSurely someone must have kept a proper journal.\n* * *\n[Item 5: a page torn from an unidentified tome, undated, watermarked with the Mages\u2019 Guild First Era insignia. Singed fingerprints stain the outside edge.]\nWe\u2019ve overtaken their disgusting ruin, but still the outcasts persist. They know their warren of tunnels better than we can hope to learn, creeping in from gods know where to hide within the walls, dogging our steps until we dare not travel outside a heavy group. We are all of us trained battle mages, and yet we cannot sleep for worry.\nComing here, we believed it would be easier to purge this sickness. And true, the waking revenants they raised, those desecrations of their ancestors, fell to fire easily enough. But the horror of their corpse-woke masters\u2014\nI find words limited and too fleeting. I have never encountered such as this.\nWe destroyed those we could, but though they numbered few, their sheer power was unimaginable. Only through great sacrifice were we able to manage what little we achieved. And though we drove their acolytes from their den, though we ruined every record we could find, just this evening we received grievous news.\nAnother managed the ritual. Our scouts report sighting a woman outside the walls, her form uneasy in a way they\u2019ve come to recognize. She toyed with the pyre-stacked corpses of her brethren, but whatever she searched for, she did not find. We were thorough in our purification. No foul fruit of a broken grave will rise from that stinking mire.\nAnd yet, one lich remains, nearly made, caught between life and otherwise.\nThe others look to me, but I do not know what order to give them. This beast cannot be allowed to live\u2014given half a chance they always take apprentices\u2014but to kill her will complete the ritual. In that instant of sword strike or spell-fire, she will wake un-living, a monstrous abomination greater than our ability to destroy.\nWe do not have the resources left to face another. Already our numbers fall scant and sore wrought. We cannot spare the hands to bury our dead\u2014have not the ability remaining even to sanctify their empty forms\u2014and yet we do not dare leave them within such a creature\u2019s influence.\nGods guide us\u2014I do not know what to do.\n* * *\n[Item 4-2: damage to document more extensive than originally estimated. Several pages irreparable. Many portions of surviving text obscured by unidentified opalescence. Transcription ongoing; however, further results unlikely.]\n. . . not unlike the quartz gardens of the Vartari Mountains, each crystal channeling and amplifying ground magic through a predetermined pattern in order to assist in the creation of a particular spell, while also allaying the draining effect such an effort would otherwise have on the caster (Arvel 18). Achieving this result depends on a precise placement of source-runes in a nontraditional pattern. Relocation of a single rune\u2014even the typically innocuous odal\u2014warps the magical resonance of the ward system, diverting the intent of the spell inward, thus destroying its protective capacity from outward forces.\nHowever, such inversion of the Pertho-Dagaz Dichotomy creates a sealed environment in which magical dispersal proves impossible. When combined with rainwater, the spell runoff changes quality, binding with the newly introduced material and thereby creating the fluctuations in the fabric of measureable perception that make any method of fixed interpretation concerning the Wellspring impossible.\nIt is of interest to note that such a system renders itself essentially self-fueling. Given enough time, the quantity of raw energy loose within the ward line would allow a caster truly massive potential, displacing the stress of major spells from the body and onto the absorptive capacity of the inverted ward itself. Channeled appropriately, one could theoretically rewrite even the magical system of one\u2019s own body.\nSuch an action would, of course, cause widespread tissue damage resulting in \u201cdeath\u201d of the physical form. Yet, with a little preparation and the sheer quantity of power available, a skilled mage could place her failing body within the confines of a resurrection spell, self-reanimating upon her \u201cdeath.\u201d Taking advantage of the duality of perception within the Wellspring, such a mage would become both \u201calive\u201d and \u201cdead,\u201d essentially re-creating the lost process of lichification.\n* * *\n[Item 5-2: a page torn from an unidentified tome, undated. Watermark, paper quality, singe, and handwriting consistent with that of Item 5-1. Both reasonably assumed to originate from the same text.]\nWe have trapped her. Yet more lives lost, but we have trapped her, and in the attempt, destroyed much of their disgusting den. I do not celebrate, however. Even now the ward we built struggles to contain her. Spell-mangled and mad, she rattles within the charred and empty crater of her capture, striking at the walls and spitting ceaseless curses.\nGods, but her mouth bleeds so.\nThe remaining others sing their praises and move on to needful tasks, patching wounds and honoring our dead. I cannot join them, neither to heal nor to mourn. I do not\u2014\nI do not trust this thing we made. These ward lines seem to hold, but they do not act as I expect, and I cannot risk an alteration lest the beast escape. I can only hope that the spell does not somehow preserve her further\u2014that trapped within, a natural death might end even her magically augmented existence.\nI do not know how long such a thing would take. Does a lich eat? Does it drink or sleep? Are we depriving her of little else but freedom?\nI cannot cease my vigil. I do not dare.\nI comfort myself in assurances we have sealed access to the ward as best we can. It lays inaccessible from beneath, where she could breach the crater and disappear into the warrens of the wreckage they called a \u201cCollege.\u201d I watch her now from level ground, peering down.\nWith all our storms, I expect the crater will fill with water soon.\nSurely, she is trapped. One day she will burn herself out. She will drown. With only rainwater and the fumes of her foul spellwork, she will have to cease this madness. A flame cannot burn in a vacuum.\nAnd yet.\nShe walks. She watches me. Her mouth continues to bleed.\nI do not know what we have done.\n* * *\n[Item 1-5, ongoing transcription.]\n30th of First Month, 3E 45\nCast a water-ward of my own and blasted a hole in the Wellspring-facing wall today. (With my research as complete as it can be at this juncture, I have little enough to fear from rampaging idiots swarming these halls.) My watery friend met me at the breach, drawn by the end of her imprisonment and the noise of my approach. Pathetic, really, how little true work it took to break her binding. Typical human construction.\nNot to say I am not pleased\u2014gods, but I have missed intelligent company.\nMelissea speaks mostly with sign, given how she mangled her mouth casting curses, but she\u2019s improved her gestures much since our last exchange. We spoke for some length over wine and an array of treats I brought from above, a delightful conversation on our respective research. I have not enjoyed such a parlay of advanced spellwork in\u2014oh, however long I\u2019ve been studying here.\nApparently her own lichification ritual is only at last completed by a final violence, full and powerful undeath triggered the moment the opponent\u2019s weapon reemerges from the wound (a logical conclusion that seems to have escaped the crusading Mages\u2019 Guild, unsurprisingly enough).\nI\u2019ve built a theoretical ritual of my own that renders the aid\/attack of an outside party unnecessary. I dislike relying on others, especially considering the odds of the act falling to someone less competent than myself are so extremely high. Melissea offered her assistance and seemed eager to provide it, but I trust very few people. Certainly I don\u2019t intend to begin cherry-picking my closest confidants from the bellies of misapplied First Era curses.\nHowever, I will say that I don\u2019t reject the prospect. Perhaps eventually we might come to know each other so well. We\u2019ll have years in shared company, after all. I covet a great deal of her since-lost spells, and clearly she must learn a plethora of new curses if ever she wishes to return to the cunning North. We have agreed to a certain quantity of future reciprocity.\nIn any case, Melissea cannot alter the terms of her undeath at this late stage of the game, and so I have done her the favor of her resurrection. While normally I would never leave a future rival in a position of such unmitigated power, this one will owe me a rather enormous favor when her ritual completes.\nIt is a knife\u2019s-edge gambit\u2014as dangerous as it is valuable\u2014but I believe I\u2019ve chosen well, if largely because I expect to finish my own ritual by the time she wakes. As we say, potential enemies make the finest friends.\nI asked a small favor of her in the meanwhile, a tiny advance against the massive debt of her shiny new undeath. It\u2019s a petty little thing, really\u2014a brief hesitation between act and action. . . .\nAnd, of course, a visit to the dean.\n* * *\n[Item 6: female corpse of excellent preservation and indeterminate age.

The radio reports that a dragon has been spotted in Whispering Pines Park, and should be considered extremely dangerous. The park borders the house where Rafiela works, and Americans are given to hysteria when it comes to wild animals. She considers the possibility that she will be asked to stay home and can\u2019t decide if she is relieved or disappointed. But of course this is not the case.\nThe kitchen telephone rings at a quarter to seven, and Mrs. Cobb is on the other end. \u201cThank god I caught you,\u201d she says. Rafiela allows herself an instant to acknowledge the stupid warmth that rushes over her at the sound of the familiar voice speaking out of her mint-green receiver. She sees Mrs. Cobb every day, but she has never called Rafiela at home, the way a sister might, or a friend. \u201cListen, the park is a nightmare, crawling with reporters and police and I don\u2019t know what else. Can you come in as normal, but wait at the bus stop for Marcel to pick you up?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I can,\u201d Rafiela promises, cradling the receiver with both hands. \u201cBut it is not necessary for Marcel to come,\u201d she adds, struggling briefly to form the sentence correctly in English. \u201cIf there are police and reporters, it is safe, I think.\u201d She doesn\u2019t add that she\u2019s seen dragons before, little red-spotted ones that lived in the trees outside her home in Veracruz, that probably this dragon is as shy as they were.\n\u201cOh are you sure?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks, and Rafiela replies yes, she is sure, yes, she will come. \u201cThank you, Rafiela,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says softly, and she is too surprised to reply. Mrs. Cobb does not often say Rafiela\u2019s name. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d Mrs. Cobb adds, and hangs up. Rafiela leans against the sink for a moment with the dial tone ringing against her ear, smiling at nothing.\nDuring the bus ride from downtown San Pedro to the Palos Verdes estates, she learns a great many things about the dragon. A discarded newspaper on the seat beside her relates that it was first spotted by a pair of frightened gardeners who sounded the alarm, followed by a paparazzo waiting for Lana Turner to exit a friend\u2019s mansion. Startled out of his rosebush, the man snapped several photographs before fleeing in terror, one of which graces the cover of the Times. It is only a black-and-white silhouette, but it is enough for the experts to weigh in.\nThe dragon is ten feet long, at least. It weighs over two hundred pounds, is armored in scales as strong as bone, can smell blood from up to ten miles away. It is of the species Coco draconis, native to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Ecuador, hunted nearly to extinction by the conquistadors, the larger and more famous cousin of the little drag\u00f3nes that chittered in the trees outside her house in Veracruz. It is a deadly predator. It dislocates its massive jaw to swallow its prey (goats, dogs, pigs, humans) whole, but then it must spend two to three days just digesting, during which time it is completely helpless. The wings are merely vestigial. The teeth, though. All three rows are razor sharp, and could sever a man\u2019s limb in under a second. It is not until the very last detail is revealed that Rafiela begins to be afraid: an expert predicted that the dragon was probably an illegal purchase, raised in captivity by a Hollywood millionaire, and dumped in the park when it got too terrifyingly large for parties. Animals raised without fear and experience to guide them cannot be predicted. She disembarks from the bus with tightened shoulders.\nHer walk from the bus stop through Whispering Pines Park is only half a mile long, and the park is indeed crowded with people. There are men with heavy cameras hanging from their necks, men in tan uniforms who could only be park rangers called in from Laguna or Hollywood or somewhere with more animal problems. Even when she can\u2019t see them, she can hear them calling to each other. She feels silly for being afraid, even momentarily. It is not a large park, only five or six acres of bourgeois wilderness and white-picketed horse paths to work through. She imagines the dragon will be caught very quickly.\nThe Cobb home is stucco-white and ornate, a red-tiled castle bordered by a courtyard on one side and the edge of Whispering Pines Park on the other. Today, it is on red alert.\nMrs. Cobb greets her at the door with the baby in her arms, caught between stress and relief. Her fine blonde hair is in disarray, there is a faint spot of drool on her dress where the baby is sucking idly at the fabric, and she is wearing only one earring. She looks beautiful, but Rafiela always thinks she looks beautiful.\n\u201cThank god you\u2019re here,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, and gently drops the baby into her arms, fingers just brushing Rafiela\u2019s skin. Rafiela adjusts the baby so his weight is against her hip, and Mrs. Cobb lets out a fragile sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve been going out of my mind.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they will catch the dragon soon,\u201d Rafiela murmurs. A string of spit falls from the baby\u2019s mouth onto her blouse. Mrs. Cobb says that she hopes so, but she isn\u2019t certain of anything. \u201cAnya wouldn\u2019t come in at all, and Marcel took Mr. Cobb to the office\u2014so it\u2019ll be up to you to hold down the fort. Is that all right?\u201d She\u2019s wearing an earnest, guileless look of expectation\u2014the kind of look that wouldn\u2019t be nearly as effective if she weren\u2019t so lovely, or so young. Mrs. Cobb is only twenty, two years younger than Rafiela herself. As it is, she reminds Rafiela of the blonde Madonnas she\u2019s seen in paintings, translucent and full of hope.\n\u201cOf course it is all right,\u201d Rafiela says, bouncing the baby a little. \u201cI am here to help.\u201d\nMrs. Cobb gives Rafiela a grateful smile and a set of instructions handed down to her from Mr. Cobb. The instructions run like this: all the doors in the house must be locked. Rafiela suspects that even the deadliest lizard on earth couldn\u2019t manage to open a closed door without opposable thumbs, but she nods encouragingly as Mrs. Cobb continues. The windows on the first two floors should be bolted shut. It is eighty degrees in Palos Verdes, and yet the nursery too must remain completely impregnable, even though it is on the second floor. Rafiela suspects the heat is more likely to kill the baby than any dragon, and resolves to relocate the kitchen fan to the nursery. The baby starts to wriggle in her arms, so she puts him down with his back resting against her legs, letting him blink stupidly at the hardwood. He slaps the floor with his fat little hands.\n\u201cNo walks in the park today,\u201d Mrs. Cobb goes on, wincing to show that she understands Rafiela knows this. \u201cUm, no walks in the neighborhood, the courtyard, or down to the beach. Just don\u2019t take the baby outdoors, at least for now.\u201d The house will be oppressively hot during the day, even with the fans, and Rafiela finds the baby\u2019s company tedious even on the days when she can leave the house. With the rest of the staff off or busy and Mrs. Cobb working at her art all day, she\u2019ll be left quite alone.\n\u201cCan Marcel take us out in the car?\u201d Rafiela wants to know. The Cobbs employ a full-time driver, and occasionally he will drop Rafiela and the baby off at the beach or the shops, when he has long breaks between driving either Cobb to their engagements.\n\u201cWould you mind terribly just keeping him in the house? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll kill the creature soon, but I don\u2019t want to take any chances,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, a pale hand slipping down to her heart. Her dress today is green silk, and her fingers leave little ripples in the fabric.\n\u201cOf course, Mrs. Cobb,\u201d Rafiela says, and is rewarded with a pink smile. In a flurry of silk and relief, Mrs. Cobb hurries up to the third floor, where her little art studio and its open windows wait. She will likely not emerge for hours. Rafiela and the baby are left alone.\nShe is not fond of the baby, although she has spent four of the six months he has been alive at his side. His name is Alvin Jasper, which she cannot pronounce to Mr. Cobb\u2019s satisfaction, so she\u2019s gotten into the habit of just calling him \u201cthe baby,\u201d or, when the Cobbs are not near, \u201cel pescado,\u201d because he reminds her of a fat little fish on a hook. He is large and wriggling and has the pink and slightly raw look of undercooked salmon, particularly when he sweats inside his white shift, as he is sweating now. He drools, so the entire front of his body is always wet. His toothless, gummy mouth also reminds her of a salmon, open and gasping. He sucks at her fingers, at her uniform, at whatever part of her she allows in reach of his hungry mouth. He is teething. Babies like the pressure of something solid against their gums as their teeth come in, and el pescado seems determined that it be her.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asks el pescado in Spanish, scooping him up off the floor. \u201cDo you think the dragon will come inside? Will we all get eaten up?\u201d El pescado grabs for her index finger with one tiny hand, as though to demonstrate the extent of his strength. \u201cIf I had to pick between saving you and saving your mama, I\u2019d pick her,\u201d she says, but gently. \u201cYou can\u2019t even run.\u201d\n* * *\nMrs. Cobb remains upstairs all morning. This is not unusual\u2014Rafiela has known her to paint for five or six hours without interruption. But today she resents it, just a little. It must be cooler on the third floor, with the windows open as wide as Mrs. Cobb likes, the breeze taking away the smell of turpentine. The fans downstairs simply blow around hot air. The baby fusses, hot and unhappy, as if he too knows his mother is just above his head. Rafiela reads him a book, drapes a wet cloth over his warm belly, carries him to all the potted plants in the house so he can gravely examine the flowers. He is amused for a while by a vase of pink roses, and Rafiela plucks one out to dangle over his head. He grabs for it, and she flicks it out of his reach. It is the same game she would play with a dog. Eventually she lets him catch it, petals crumpled by his clumsy grip.\nSoon she hears Mrs. Cobb\u2019s heels clicking on the red-tiled staircase, and she joins them in the kitchen.\n\u201cOh, here you are,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says. \u201cI was beginning to get lonely.\u201d\n\u201cWe are here,\u201d Rafiela says, patting el pescado\u2019s belly. He grunts, sucks harder on his bottle, and Mrs. Cobb smiles.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d She goes to the liquor cabinet. Rafiela focuses on feeding the baby while Mrs. Cobb fixes herself a drink. The baby stops drinking to gulp in air.\n\u201cHow does the painting come?\u201d Rafiela asks.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, seating herself at the edge of the kitchen\u2019s marble counter, a mere three feet from Rafiela. It feels uncomfortably domestic, and Rafiela\u2019s foolish pulse quickens, her mouth goes dry. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to stop listening to the news. Did you know,\u201d she says, voice taking on a hushed quality, \u201cthat two years ago Rita Hayworth\u2019s husband lost a toe to a dragon?\u201d She takes a healthy sip of her drink.\n\u201cI did not know,\u201d Rafiela says, and Mrs. Cobb tells her that it was a trip to the Los Angeles zoo gone very wrong, that Rita Hayworth is so disturbed by the presence of a wild dragon that she\u2019s gone to New York for the week. \u201cI\u2019m jealous,\u201d Mrs. Cobb admits. \u201cI\u2019d love to be halfway across the country by now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you stay?\u201d Rafiela ventures, and Mrs. Cobb laughs.\n\u201cI\u2019m a very silly woman, you know,\u201d she says, finishing her drink. \u201cI\u2019ll worry about anything. And David doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s any danger, really, so long as we stay inside. But I do wish he\u2019d have stayed home, at the very least.\u201d She looks very young, like a child herself, before suddenly smiling, bright and focused. \u201cBut you\u2019re here! So I\u2019ll try not to worry.\u201d\n\u201cI am here,\u201d Rafiela agrees, and wills her heart not to ache. She keeps her breathing even, her eyes on el pescado\u2019s bald head.\nShe is not a stupid girl. She understands what it is that she feels. More than that, she reads the pulp magazines. Flimsy books with beautiful and tortured women on their covers, their titles things like El Camino Extra\u00f1o, La Camina Tercera, La Falta de Maria. She understands these stories. Any girl crazy enough to fall in love with another girl is doomed to suicide or madness, and both spell death for a woman. Tragedy is the world\u2019s punishment for sin.\n* * *\nShe only got the job because of Mrs. Cobb\u2019s whimsy. She is only twenty-two, and has one paltry reference to speak of\u2014the Irish woman in Rafiela\u2019s neighborhood who needed help with her children. Nothing about her background should merit a job working for David and Evelyn Cobb. She met them purely by accident, at a little cove near Corona del Mar, the most beautiful beach in all of Southern California (or so Mrs. Cobb later assured her). Mrs. Cobb left the baby with his first nanny\u2014an older woman Mrs. Cobb resented for making her feel inexperienced\u2014and went to revive herself at the crown of the sea.\nRafiela arrived at the beach with four of her youngest cousins in tow. The cousins all happened to be born of her t\u00eda\u2019s Swedish husband, and so each of them had hair as fine and light as sunshine. She imagines Mrs. Cobb\u2019s first view of her, descending from the cliff face down into the water like a brown shepherd followed by a tiny white flock, like everything Mrs. Cobb needed.\nRafiela emerged from the sea with one blonde child on her shoulders to find a white woman staring at her. Rafiela was struck by how very fragile she seemed\u2014even her skin seemed like it could barely hold back her blood, flushing pink at her elbows, her knuckles, her soft knees.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so good with children,\u201d Mrs. Cobb said, smiling radiantly.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Rafiela said, fighting back a wince as the cousin on her shoulders pulled at her hair.\nMrs. Cobb laughed and reached out to detach the child\u2019s hand from Rafiela\u2019s curls, and Rafiela caught her breath. It was not even that Mrs. Cobb looked like a film star, with her clear skin and wide green eyes\u2014it was simply her proximity, the fingers delicately resettling Rafiela\u2019s hair. It was like finding a string of pearls washed up with the seaweed. As though something beautiful and rare had come suddenly and inexplicably within her reach, although she could never afford it. Mrs. Cobb asked her more questions, youthful impulse mingled with delight. Did she live in Los Angeles? Did she love children? Would she submit to a background check? Would she be willing to come in for an interview? All Rafiela could say was yes, she did, yes, she would, yes.\n* * *\nMrs. Cobb stays in her company all through the afternoon, to the early evening. She is tipsy and full of praise, slipping off her heeled shoes and leaving them on the living room floor, as if she\u2019s forgotten that the rest of the help will not risk death by dragon to come and clear them away. She plays a silly game with the baby for ten whole minutes before she gets bored, tapping him on the nose and laughing when he smiles. She puts on music and dances in her bare feet. She attempts to cajole Rafiela into dancing as well, but Rafiela is too embarrassed\u2014and besides, she is content to watch. Mrs. Cobb mixes more drinks and stands for several minutes before the kitchen fan, her hair blowing back from her face. When Rafiela finally goes to put the baby down, Mrs. Cobb follows.\nThe nursery is still too warm, even in the late twilight. Mrs. Cobb leans against the locked window, the light fading behind her, as Rafiela settles the baby in his crib.\n\u201cNo lullaby?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if all the words are right,\u201d Rafiela confesses. She often sings el pescado lullabies in Spanish, but she does not want to sing those in front of Mrs. Cobb.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, and comes to stand beside the crib, next to her. \u201cI\u2019ll chime in if you need help.\u201d\n\u201cHush, little baby,\u201d Rafiela begins, flushed and uncomfortable. Mrs. Cobb\u2019s hands are very close to hers on the smooth wooden rail. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word. Mama\u2019s going to buy you a mockingbird.\u201d She pauses, and Mrs. Cobb taps her hand lightly with two fingers.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know the rest. And if that mockingbird don\u2019t sing, Mama\u2019s gonna buy you a diamond ring.\u201d She joins Rafiela for the rest of the song, and she keeps those two fingers resting on the back of Rafiela\u2019s hand.\nWhen el pescado finally closes his puffy eyes, Rafiela goes to slip out of the room, but Mrs. Cobb catches her by the wrist, looking grave. \u201cDo you really think there\u2019s no danger from the dragon?\u201d she asks in a whisper.\n\u201cI think you are safe,\u201d Rafiela tells her, honestly. \u201cI think outside, maybe there is trouble. But here you are fine.\u201d\nMrs. Cobb nods, still unaccountably solemn. She lets Rafiela\u2019s wrist go and turns away to open the window, just a crack. Cool air sinks into the room. \u201cThank you, Rafiela,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, still in that soft voice.\nBy the time Rafiela collects her purse and leaves through the side door, it has gone full dark. The black tangle of the park looms before her. Things stir in the leaves. She goes back into the house to ask Marcel for a ride to the bus stop.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why you showed up today,\u201d Marcel tells her on the way. \u201cI told him this morning I\u2019d only come in if I didn\u2019t have to get out of the car. You hear about Rita Hayworth? These things could kill you.\u201d\n\u201cSucker for punishment, I guess,\u201d Rafiela says, looking out the dark window.\n* * *\nThe dragon remains on the loose all week, and Mrs. Cobb stays with them in the house. Rafiela is alternately pleased and exhausted by Mrs. Cobb\u2019s constant presence, on edge, uncertain in her own skin\u2014and of course there is always the dragon to fear. Some days she wakes up at four a.m. just so she can walk the five miles down the dirt road from the bus stop instead of cutting through the half-mile of park. Dragon slayers have been summoned all the way from Florida to root it out\u2014and they are flummoxed. The radiomen are morbidly delighted. The weather is exhausting. Rafiela and the baby grow very tired of the new state of affairs.\nAt the week\u2019s end Mr. Cobb comes home for lunch, very dour. He explains that he\u2019s only here to grab some papers from his office, but since it\u2019s noon, could Rafiela please fix him a sandwich? Mrs. Cobb frowns slightly but does not countermand the order.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have bad news,\u201d he tells his wife as Rafiela fixes him his sandwich. The baby is settled in his high chair, amusing himself by chewing on his own hands. Mr. Cobb glances once in his direction from where he leans against the marble top of the kitchen island, but does not go to him.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you get it over with?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks him, the newly prepared cocktail trembling a little in her hands.\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d Mr. Cobb says gently, \u201cbecause you girls are perfectly safe. But there was an incident a few hours ago. It hasn\u2019t hit the papers yet, but there\u2019s been an attack in the park.\u201d Mrs. Cobb gasps, and he holds up a finger, accepting the plate Rafiela sets in front of him. \u201cNo one was killed,\u201d he says soothingly. \u201cAnd it was no one you know\u2014just the Murphys\u2019 gardener.\u201d He takes an enormous bite.\n\u201cThe Murphys live next door,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says sharply. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the dragon came right at him,\u201d Mr. Cobb says, swallowing. \u201cOut of the shrubs.\u201d Another bite. The thick crunch of teeth on romaine. \u201cIt got his hand in its mouth. Lucky for him he had a pal nearby\u2014got the dragon right on the head with a shovel.\u201d\nSnap. Crunch. The baby blows a spit bubble. Mr. Cobb sucks some mustard off one finger. \u201cIt sounds like he only lost a few fingers, in the end\u2014he\u2019s gonna be just fine. But it was close, Evelyn. So I want to make sure you don\u2019t do anything reckless.\u201d Mrs. Cobb promises him that of course she won\u2019t, her voice pitched high with fear, and Rafiela gathers up the sandwich ingredients and returns them to the refrigerator. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Mr. Cobb says, wiping his mouth with a napkin before dropping it onto his plate. \u201cBetter safe than sorry, right?\u201d\n* * *\nMr. Cobb leaves, and Mrs. Cobb is visibly shaken. The Murphys are right next door. Just a couple of fingers. Jesus. She thought it would be gone by now, but it\u2019s not gone, and she doesn\u2019t know what to do with herself. She insists that Rafiela and el pescado accompany her to the third floor. She takes them to the studio\u2014a little white room with wide windows, where she does her painting\u2014and proceeds to lock every window, draw every curtain. She shuts the door, and sits herself against it. There is no fan in the studio, but Mrs. Cobb is too frightened to see reason. \u201cJust for a little while,\u201d she begs Rafiela. \u201cJust until I can feel safe again.\u201d El pescado hiccups, and Mrs. Cobb flinches. \u201cChrist.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d Rafiela says helplessly, el pescado in her arms. He is fussy, unhappy with the heat, with the room, and keeps spitting his pacifier out and then raging at its absence.\n\u201cCan you make him be quiet?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks, with her knees drawn up to her chest. There are pale blue shadows under her eyes, where the skin is very fragile, and Rafiela wants very much to trace them with her fingers.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is all Rafiela says. The studio is very still, warm and yellow, and of course it is very hot. \u201cI could take him back downstairs.\u201d\nMrs. Cobb shakes her head. \u201cJust, um. Tell him a story. About anything. Maybe that will help.\u201d Speaking for great lengths in English is not Rafiela\u2019s strength, but she does her best.\nRafiela tells el pescado and his frightened mother a story about a princess. The princess goes one day into her garden, and there she finds an orange. She peels the orange, and what should be inside but a dragon. A little dragon, like the ones Rafiela knew, the size of your hand. The dragon tells the princess she can have a wish. Anything she wants.\n\u201cWhat does the princess want?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks softly. She is looking right at Rafiela, but Rafiela is not quite brave enough to meet her gaze.\n\u201cThe princess is lonely,\u201d Rafiela mumbles, staring at the sparse hairs on el pescado\u2019s sweaty head. \u201cThe princess wants for company.\u201d\nThere is a very long silence, and then Mrs. Cobb lets out a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m being a fool again, aren\u2019t I?\u201d She stands and opens the windows, all of them, all the way up. When she comes to sit back down, her knee brushes Rafiela\u2019s knee. She can feel the warmth of Mrs. Cobb\u2019s body, warmer still than the yellow room around them. \u201cWhat does the dragon want?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks.\nRafiela does meet Mrs. Cobb\u2019s eyes this time. The whisper of a breeze has stolen into the room, soothing el pescado in her lap, and Mrs. Cobb is looking at her as though Rafiela can give her something. \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d she says, hoping her heart is not beating too loudly, giving her away. \u201cWhat dragons always want.\u201d\n\u201cMeat?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks.\n\u201cPrincesses,\u201d Rafiela replies.\nThere\u2019s a strange little pause, and then Mrs. Cobb laughs and stands up again. She stretches out a hand to Rafiela, to help her up. Rafiela takes it, the baby awkwardly pressed to her chest one-handed, and lets Mrs. Cobb pull her to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve been so silly,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, not relinquishing Rafiela\u2019s hand, \u201cmaking us come up here. Let\u2019s go back down.\u201d\nRafiela tentatively squeezes Mrs. Cobb\u2019s hand, and is tugged out of the room and back down the stairs. \u201cHere,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, her voice a little higher than usual, \u201cwe can put the baby on a blanket, and we can listen to some music! I think I\u2019d like some music.\u201d She leaves Rafiela to settle el pescado on the floor and fiddles with the radio until music pours into the room.\n\u201cDance with me,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, playful and girlish, and Rafiela is forced to repeat herself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to dance, Mrs. Cobb,\u201d she says.\n\u201cDance with me anyway,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says. She steps close and catches Rafiela\u2019s hands, pulling her into motion. Rafiela doesn\u2019t know the song, and it\u2019s hard to understand songs in English, anyway, they go so fast\u2014she catches words here and there: baby, honey, always, you, still. They dance like girls, holding hands, Mrs. Cobb\u2019s skirt twirling out and brushing Rafiela\u2019s shins. The baby is grunting to himself on the floor, and they both ignore him. \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you ever call me Evelyn? We see each other every day.\u201d\nRafiela tries to steady her breathing, and somehow cannot come up with a satisfactory answer. Why doesn\u2019t she ever call Mrs. Cobb Evelyn? She is only twenty. Only a year ago Evelyn\u2019s last name was not even Cobb, although Rafiela did not know her then. Imagine\u2014just a year ago, Evelyn was an unmarried girl, and Rafiela did not know her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Rafiela says, and she is gripping Mrs. Cobb\u2019s hands now, hard.\nMrs. Cobb kisses her. It\u2019s a chaste kiss, a girl\u2019s kiss. Rafiela goes utterly still, the music washing around them like water over stones. Mrs. Cobb gives her a very close and very small smile. Tragedy, Rafiela reminds herself, suicide, madness, other forms of heartache. But she can control nothing, not her breath or her pulse or the shiver of surprise running down her spine. She closes her eyes and kisses Mrs. Cobb.\nThe song ends, and a news program begins. For all you folks worrying about the Whispering Pines Dragon, you can rest easy now. A team of dragon slayers\u2014including Florida\u2019s own Noah Gursky\u2014managed to subdue the animal and get it into a truck. Looks like it\u2019s headed to the LA Zoo, according to a Times reporter.\nMrs. Cobb breaks away, and for an awful second Rafiela is afraid that this was it\u2014that once the dragon and their strange imprisonment were gone, they would have to pretend this never happened\u2014but then Mrs. Cobb gives her an enormous, dazzling smile. She laughs and kisses Rafiela on the cheek before whirling away to scoop up el pescado from the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d she says, and kisses his forehead, making his red face wrinkle with pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d she repeats, a delighted child. He starts sucking on the collar of her dress, but she does not appear to notice, returning her attention to Rafiela. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside,\u201d she says, all bright eyes and relief. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go for a walk?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Rafiela says, as though she has ever said anything else.\n* * *\nMrs. Cobb puts the baby in his stroller and throws the front door open. She darts into the courtyard, pushing the stroller into the sunshine. It\u2019s a hot day, but the breeze is drifting around them, a hopeless relief after the stifling week. Her dress is so red against the bright grass. She looks like a girl pretending to be a mother, innocently pleased. The baby is gurgling too.\nMrs. Cobb calls for Rafiela to join her, and she steps forward, onto the grass. There\u2019s no one there to see them, but it still feels bold. Mrs. Cobb takes her hand and pulls her along. What a picture they must make, Rafiela thinks\u2014Mrs. Cobb pushing the stroller and Rafiela right beside her, and their hands clasped.\n\u201cSometimes I am so unhappy,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says dreamily. \u201cSometimes I feel like I could be trapped in an orange, waiting for someone to peel me open. I don\u2019t suppose you have any idea.\u201d\n\u201cI have some idea,\u201d Rafiela says.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy now, though,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says. She lets go of the stroller, and it rolls forward just a foot. El pescado makes an interested chirp. She does not let go of Rafiela\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d\nRafiela answers yes. But she is only here for the baby.\n\u201cThe baby, the baby,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says. Her thumb strokes a line down Rafiela\u2019s thumb. \u201cDo you know he nearly killed me when he was born? Why should you care about the baby?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Rafiela says in a breathless rush. \u201cHe\u2019s the only reason I can come here.\u201d\n\u201cDo you love my baby?\u201d Mrs. Cobb asks. She laughs, and Rafiela does not know what to say, her heart pounding, so she kisses Mrs. Cobb\u2019s knuckles, a sweet little brush. \u201cCome on,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, and pulls Rafiela forward, just into the shady cover of the trees, where they can no longer be seen from the house.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lonely,\u201d Mrs. Cobb says, and draws Rafiela\u2019s hand up to her face, pressing it there with her own. Her voice trembles a little, and that is what gives Rafiela the courage to lean forward and kiss her again, a real kiss this time. Mrs. Cobb sighs, and Rafiela cannot even close her eyes, she is so overwhelmed. Mrs. Cobb smiles against her mouth, and they break apart for a moment to breathe.\nMrs. Cobb looks like a princess in a fairy tale, so impossible that she might as well be long ago, or far away. And then Mrs. Cobb is kissing her once more, is pushing her into the soft trunk of an aspen tree, her hands dropping to Rafiela\u2019s waist, and Rafiela does close her eyes then. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Mrs. Cobb whispers, and Rafiela is glad too, so glad.\nThey break apart at the sound of the stroller tipping over.\n* * *\nNeither the radios nor the gossip nor the papers prepare Rafiela for exactly how fast a fully grown dragon can move. The fire is a myth. The wings are vestigial. But it is still every inch the monster from the stories. The stroller lies on its side in the grass. The jaw distends. Later, Rafiela will learn that the dragon fooled its human jailers and escaped from the armored car, still hungry. There is a great deal of blood.\nMrs. Cobb will not stop screaming, even as Rafiela shouts for her to go inside, call the police. Rafiela herself runs toward the park, dumb instinct driving her and nothing else.\nThe park is green, and the dragon\u2019s shifting scales vanish immediately in the dappled light. Baby, Rafiela shouts as she runs, and then Alvin, Alvin. She runs for a long time, flinching toward the slightest noise, the slightest movement, under the fronds of familiar pepper trees, past junipers and the odd palm and some winding passion flower vine, the delicate horseback riding trail left behind.\nEventually she must slow to a walk or fall. Her heart is pounding violently, her blood pulsing with effort, her breath coming in sucking gasps, and she has a stitch in her side so terrible it feels like a knife. She is deep in the park, now. The path is somewhere behind her, as is the house, the manicured lawn, Mrs. Cobb with her swollen pink mouth. She does not know where the dragon is, but she picks up a branch from the ground, long and thick.\nAll right. All right. There are some things Rafiela does know. She will no longer have a job when she returns. Oh, no matter what happens, she will no longer have a job. Accidents happen, but of course blame will be laid regardless. Can she even claim innocence of guilt, when she knew she had tempted fate? When she knew the world could not suffer such sweetness, that it must always be bought and paid for? Perhaps she should have tried harder to love the baby. He screamed when the monster came for him\u2014a familiar ragged wail\u2014the same scream he gave for any number of reasons. Because he did not like the dark, because he was hungry, because he was tired. Rafiela cannot return to the house without the baby.\nShe walks for a very long time.\n* * *\nIt is twilight when she finds the dragon. She hears no sirens, no sounds of a search party. She is very deep in the park. She is tired, so tired that she is reduced to dragging the branch behind her, and that is how she discovers it at all\u2014the stick catches on the snarled edge of a rosebush, and Rafiela stumbles and falls, only to come face to face with one large yellow eye.\nThe dragon is almost entirely hidden under the rosebush, lying very still. It bares a purple tongue and sharp teeth, but she can see the enormous lump in its belly where the child sits, straining its body to the limit. Very distantly she remembers the radio informing her that dragons are like many other big lizards, taking hours or even days to digest their prey. During which time they are completely helpless. Shaking badly, she prods the dragon with the stick. It thrashes for an instant, but does not lunge. She taps the lump lightly, and it hisses. Her breath hurts to draw in.\nShe wonders if the baby could still be saved, were she to cut open the dragon\u2019s stomach now, just as the baby was first cut out of Evelyn Cobb. Babies are so used to liquid worlds, without breath, without touch. Maybe el pescado would become the first child to survive a second, stranger birth, a fish returned gasping to the air. Rafiela has no knife. Just the club.\n\u201cYou look just like a mother,\u201d Rafiela tells the dragon, now shaking so much that she cannot keep hold of the club. If she does not think about the baby, the dragon is only beautiful. Shifting scales, neat wings folded over its back, black claws extended in empty warning. Rafiela scoots forward on her knees, close enough to touch. Its tongue flickers out for a brief instant, its yellow eyes widen with alarm, but it is clearly too exhausted to protest further. Satiation brings its own pain, its own dangers. She can feel the dragon\u2019s breath, hot and strange on her skin. She wants to tell the dragon\u2019s baby she is sorry, but she is so tired.\nShe lies down beside the dragon, their monstrous backs in the dirt, the black tangle of thorns nearly blocking out the sky. She reaches out and touches the scaled belly, and it feels rough and cold, like stone. The dragon gives a soft, almost childlike sigh. When she has rested, Rafiela will take up the stick. She will do what life requires of her.\n\u201cHush,\u201d she whispers to the dragon, and does not close her eyes. She does not say a word.\nMolly Olgu\u00edn is a third-year MFA candidate at The Ohio State University.

A silent red alarm flashed in the upper right quadrant of her eyescreen. She blinked hard to clear the alert, then again to steady her vision. The arterial corridor of the Orbital Control station settled into a mostly horizontal holding pattern, rocking gently. The ghosts of last night\u2019s celebrations twisted wickedly in her gut.\nAlina Holt, as of yesterday the youngest communications manager in the Centauri Foundation\u2019s fifty-three-year history, reached the control room door with less than two minutes to spare.\n\u201cLate night, Alina?\u201d asked one of the techs, with a grotesque wink, as Alina belched her way unmanagerially to her desk.\nShe rolled her eyes and glanced across to Kara McMath, who was already sitting, unruffled, at the trajectory display. Kara returned her gaze, smiled, and shrugged her broad shoulders in an I-didn\u2019t-tell-them kind of way.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to your imagination,\u201d Alina sighed.\nThe tech grinned and swivelled back to his display. \u201cSeventy-five seconds to go,\u201d he said.\nThey\u2019d been waiting for almost two and a half years since the last transmission from the February Delta mission, and she\u2019d nearly missed it for a hangover. She sat down. Smiled, as hazy flashes of the previous night permeated the morning fog.\n\u201cThirty seconds.\u201d\nShe shook her head to clear her thoughts.\nTwenty. Ten. Five. One. Then Delta\u2019s voice crackled through the speakers.\nHe rattled through the usual updates: payload health, navigation data, Martin\u2019s latest calculations. She remembered noticing an odd, almost wavering lilt to his tone last time round, and today it seemed even more pronounced. That made sense, though: Martin had been his only real conversation partner for almost twelve years now. The AI could manage something approaching a conversational tone, but something always rang slightly false. It was a shame, she thought, that February\u2019s confident, booming voice was gradually taking on the same singsong inflection that set her nerves so sharply on edge whenever the computer spoke.\n\u201cVelocity steady at point-one C,\u201d February was saying. \u201cMartin says the trajectory\u2019s about a tenth of an arcsecond out. Thrusters should kick in to fix it, soon as we launch this message. You\u2019ll have to check the report for the exact figure.\u201d\nKara scanned the navigation data scrolling down her terminal screen. \u201cGot it,\u201d she called out. \u201cAdjusting.\u201d\n\u201cMartin says the overall mission time won\u2019t change,\u201d Delta continued. There, thought Alina, as she received Kara\u2019s updated figures. There it was again. Not just an acquired accent. A slight hesitation; a stutter in his speech. She frowned as she recalibrated the comms bearing with the ship\u2019s new trajectory.\nA second voice, synthesised and soft, began to speak, its chiming consonants burrowing like shards of glass into her ears. \u201cGood-afternoon-Orbital-Control. Estimated-mission-time-remains-within-parameters. We-will-continue-on-current-bearing-and-await-instructions.\u201d\n\u201cClassic Martin,\u201d February deadpanned. \u201cWon\u2019t let me do anything on my own.\u201d\nA pause.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019s just\u2014so damn helpful all the time. Sometimes I just wish\u2014I don\u2019t know, you couldn\u2019t have programmed a few more personalities into him? Something with a bit of attitude? Huh?\u201d He paused again. \u201cAh, forget it. He\u2019s okay. Marty, you want to play Words after this?\u201d\nAlina risked a quick glance around the room. No one else seemed particularly concerned. The rampant bushes of the AI team\u2019s combined hair bobbed frenetically as they typed up Delta\u2019s feedback. Nakamoto was fiddling with his holocontrols, adjusting the audio quality on the fly. Kara was bent over her desk, her incremental nods of satisfaction confirming that Delta was still on course. Medical and Exploration were going through their respective updates, pulling through the data that would underpin their next three years of work on the Delta mission.\nDelta was still speaking: \u201c\u2014suit gets tighter by the day. I know, I know. It\u2019s important. But I\u2019m still not convinced healthy bones are worth forty years in a spandex vice.\u201d\nAlina gestured K\u00f6hlbrandt over to her desk while the pilot chattered away. The AI coordinator sauntered over, his face already arranging itself into a disdainful sneer. She knew he\u2019d wanted the Communications position, despite his glaring lack of ability in every regard of the term. \u201cK\u00f6hlbrandt,\u201d she addressed him, as professionally as she could manage. \u201cYou notice anything odd about Delta today?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied.\nShe tried to clarify. \u201cYou haven\u2019t noticed anything strange in his voice?\u201d\nK\u00f6hlbrandt sighed. \u201cLook, Holt. You haven\u2019t been here as long as me, so maybe you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d She fought hard to keep the scowl from her face; her fingernails were digging into her palms. \u201cBut if you\u2019d heard the messages we used to get from the two-man missions, you\u2019d understand that this is nothing. So he\u2019s getting a little stir-crazy. So what? It\u2019s natural. Martin\u2019s been monitoring him for more than a decade. It knows exactly what he needs to hear. If Martin\u2019s not worried, I\u2019m not worried.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cTrust me. Delta\u2019s saner than half the people on this station.\u201d\nOne of the other AI techs, a stooped twentysomething with the improbable name of Guiderius DeRogatis, chipped in, having skulked his way behind them to eavesdrop: \u201cSeriously, Holt. Martin\u2019s protocols are years ahead of anything you\u2019ve ever seen. LAYG speech patterning, Nightingale diagnosis routines, Turing networks within Turing networks. It\u2019s a thing,\u201d he proclaimed, his eyelids shuttering maddeningly, \u201cof beauty.\u201d\nAlina rolled her eyes and turned to look at the trajectory estimate. One-point-three light-years away, and counting. Thirteen years into the Delta mission and barely a quarter of the way there. But she was in for the long haul. When he finally reached Centauri, Delta was going to pave the way for the next stage of human colonisation. And besides, she\u2019d promised him, hadn\u2019t she\u2014blushingly, drunkenly\u2014way back at his prelaunch party, when he\u2019d singled her out and asked her with a grin to do him the honour of staying on the team right up until he arrived.\nOh, but so maybe she was imagining it. Maybe what it was was that he sounded older. Maybe she was just projecting the neuroses that had been creeping steadily up on her these last few years. Even last night\u2019s fling with Kara had been a\u2014pleasant, admittedly\u2014result of those same fears: Kara was young, new to the team. Impulsive. A thrill. A fleeting retrospective dip into waters she\u2019d thought she\u2019d left behind.\nShe instructed her implant to record the transmission anyway. She could review it later. After today, they\u2019d be waiting almost three more years for Delta\u2019s next message. She\u2019d have all the time she needed.\nHe was signing off. \u201cSo, well, speak to you all soon, I hope. Delta out.\u201d\nThe message closed. Lacerda cleared his throat and opened up the reply channel. \u201cThis is Mission Controller Lacerda,\u201d he said.\nAs Lacerda started to record his reply, Alina\u2019s gaze drifted over to a publicity shot of Delta that she\u2019d smarttaped to the edge of her terminal more than a decade earlier, back when she\u2019d still had that grad student crush on him. She\u2019d never quite had the heart to take it down. February beamed winningly at her from its age-smoothed paper, eternally twenty. But he would be thirty-three now, all those trillions of klicks away. Even the voice they had just heard was over a year out of date. She wondered what he would look like now, what new lines and wrinkles might have etched themselves into his face.\nShe shook herself into focus. She was barely thirty-five. She wasn\u2019t old, and neither was Delta.\nHe sounded fine.\nThe next communication came, as scheduled, just under three years later. The one after that took another three and a half. But neither reply had quite managed to set her mind to rest. Each time he\u2019d sounded just a little too stilted, a fraction too hyperactive in his speech. And now, almost eleven years after that first, half-hungover intuition, Delta\u2019s latest message would be arriving. Alina was determined to be alert for it.\nShe forced her eyes open: she\u2019d been listening to the previous messages on repeat all night, and hadn\u2019t managed to piece together more than half an hour of sleep. Her skin felt brittle and cold. She murmured a greeting to her team and sat down.\n\u201cYou look like shit, Holt,\u201d called Kara, cheerily, from across the room.\nAlina waved an obscenity at her wife.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Lacerda reprimanded them. \u201cDelta\u2019ll be coming through any minute.\u201d\nShe nodded at him and ordered Nakamoto to open the audio channel. He dutifully began to prep the speakers.\nShe was sipping from a beaker of coffee when a burst of earsplitting static erupted from the speakers. \u201cTurn that off!\u201d she yelled.\nNakamoto thrust his hands into the holocontrols and brought the noise under control. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d he protested. \u201cEverything was set up perfect.\u201d\nAlina scanned her screen. Everything seemed normal. Message showed some slight scatter-decay, but nothing that should have\u2014ah. \u201cIt\u2019s encrypted,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cDoesn\u2019t say why. Hold on.\u201d\nShe ran the feed through her terminal and tapped in her password. This time Delta\u2019s voice came through, brisk and clear.\n\u201cOrbital Control, this is February Delta. If you get this, you\u2019ll know I had to encrypt the message. If I didn\u2019t, Martin wouldn\u2019t have sent it. I need you to listen carefully.\u201d\nThis time even the crackle of the audio feed couldn\u2019t hide his distress. Lacerda\u2019s voice could be heard throughout the control room, tight and calm, directing teams here and there.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to him,\u201d Delta was whispering. \u201cAt first he was fine. But then he started to cheat. At Words, chess, all of our games. Cheating! I couldn\u2019t say anything before\u2014I didn\u2019t want him to suspect I knew.\u201d\nLacerda was down among the AI team in their corner, gesticulating furiously. DeRogatis had risen to his feet. His bald pate was glinting cobalt-blue in the room\u2019s fluorescent light. Snatches of conversation and argument drifted over. \u201cNot possible.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t lie.\u201d The coordinator sounded both indignant and self-assured as he defended his team.\nDelta kept speaking, barely pausing for breath. \u201cI tried to catch him at it. But he was too sly. I couldn\u2019t prove it\u2014so I stopped playing. He was just trying to make me doubt myself.\u201d\nAlina wiped sweat and grease from her forehead. They had trained for all manner of possible emergencies: she should have been able to do this blindfolded. But Delta\u2019s furtive, fanatical voice was gnawing at her concentration, distracting and disorienting her.\n\u201cI confronted him, but he just denied it. I tried to hide. But he\u2019s everywhere! Started trying to get me to eat more food. Said it would help me start sleeping again. But it tasted wrong\u2014I know he was trying to poison me.\u201d\n\u201cPoison?\u201d bellowed Lacerda, prompting another frenzy of denials from the AI team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough,\u201d February continued, \u201cbut I\u2019ve managed to\u2014\u201d He broke off. Then: \u201cI have to go. I think he heard me.\u201d\nThe audio clicked off. A few moments of silence passed as Medical checked the suit\u2019s latest report, trying to verify Delta\u2019s claim.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not showing anything toxic,\u201d said one of the doctors, at last. \u201cLooks like he stopped eating the fabricator food a while ago, though. I\u2019d guess he\u2019s been eating the nutrient paste straight from storage.\u201d\nDeRogatis called out across the room, \u201cMartin\u2019s sent us something. Coded into the status report.\u201d\nAlina toggled the comms channel. The AI\u2019s voice buzzed out of the speakers. \u201cConcerns-about-Delta. Paranoid-tendencies. Refuses-neuroleptic-medication. I-have-assumed-passive-conversation-routines. Awaiting-further-instructions.\u201d\nLacerda chewed his lip thoughtfully. \u201cAll right, everyone: Condition Six. Delta\u2019s had some kind of a breakdown. Medical, call in Psychiatrics. We need to know exactly what we\u2019re dealing with. Our reply has to be pitch-perfect. There\u2019s no knowing how bad he\u2019ll be by the time he gets it.\u201d\nAlina raced through the timescales in her head. This message had left the ship twenty-six months ago. Whatever they sent in reply wouldn\u2019t reach Delta for almost thirty-two more. Anything could have happened by then.\n\u201cHolt!\u201d snapped Lacerda, jolting her back to reality. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for half-arsery. Either get to work, or go home.\u201d\nAlina blinked, pulled up the comms display. She tapped the ship\u2019s bearing into her terminal, readying the station\u2019s communications dishes to transmit. She didn\u2019t have time to wait. None of them did. Psych might spend hours devising a treatment plan, and it was anyone\u2019s guess as to how long AI would take to design new firmware for Martin. And every minute they spent prevaricating was another 1.8 terametres that their reply had to travel; another 66.66 seconds that Delta would be waiting, out there and alone, to hear back from them.\n\u201cLacerda,\u201d she said, her own words sounding distant through her vertigo. \u201cHe needs to hear from us as soon as possible. I can start speaking to him now, while we wait for the others.\u201d\nThe mission controller looked at her and nodded. \u201cOkay. Just keep him calm. Nothing dramatic. Stick to the facts.\u201d\nAlina swallowed and steeled herself. She opened up a live comms channel, sending its signal speeding off into the cosmos, chasing after Delta. DeRogatis and Psych could piggyback onto it whenever they were ready: February needed her to act now.\n\u201cDelta?\u201d she ventured into her headset. \u201cMike? This is Alina Holt. We met before you left. The launch party. Do you remember? Well, I\u2019m still here. Like I promised. I know you\u2019re scared out there. But it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve looked at the data, and it\u2019s going to be okay.\n\u201cI hope that when you get this message, things are looking better. I hope you won\u2019t even need to hear this. But if you\u2019re still in trouble, I want you to remember\u2014you\u2019ve got a whole team of us down here, doing our best to keep you going. We just need you to hang in there a little longer, Mike. And when you get to Centauri, safe and sound, you\u2019ll know it was worth it.\u201d\nShe finished up. She looked around. Lacerda was nodding approvingly. Kara was watching her too, from her desk, smiling encouragement. Alina returned the smile, and Kara turned back to study the data arriving at her terminal. Psych had arrived too, now, and were talking animatedly with AI. DeRogatis\u2019s wheedling voice was rising in pitch.\nAlina let out a sigh and sank, exhausted, back into her seat.\n* * *\nFor the next five years and three months, Alina played her message back almost every day. Each time she tried to imagine how he\u2019d feel when he received it. She would picture the ship\u2019s cockpit as her voice came through, grounding him back in reality. His face breaking into a smile of happy recognition, fear-filled eyes unclouding.\nKara had indulged Alina\u2019s obsession at first. But her support soon turned to concern, then frustration, and finally a bitter kind of resignation. She moved to start a new job, coordinating a belt-mine cargo route out of Phobos. Alina stayed where she was. Accepted the promotion to mission controller, when it came. They still saw each other, from time to time, but it wasn\u2019t the same.\nAnd today they\u2019d hear back from him. Today she\u2019d find out if it had all been worth it. In the corridor outside the control room, Alina took a deep breath before walking inside.\nNakamoto waved a good morning and yawned. \u201cToday\u2019s the day, huh, boss?\u201d\nShe gave him what she hoped was a gracious smile and stepped up onto the MC\u2019s dais. Delta\u2019s picture sat newly affixed to her terminal, pale with age.\n\u201cOkay, all of you,\u201d she started. She hated giving speeches. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you what the situation is, what\u2019s at risk. You all know already.\u201d\nThe control team had fallen silent. She glanced across the room. Kara\u2019s replacement was absently chewing his thumbnails as he waited for the ship\u2019s information dump to arrive. AI had brought in several of their peers to observe: Martin\u2019s capacity to adapt to his revised instructions, apparently, had the potential to be a turning point in the field.\nAlina cleared her throat. \u201cBut whatever we hear today, remember, he\u2019s counting on us. I know you\u2019re all up to it. Prove me right.\u201d\nShe sat down. Her hands were shaking. She waited.\nThe moment arrived. Breaths were drawn, then released. Fingers tapped and knees jiggled under desks. Minutes passed. That was okay. He\u2019d been late before. There could be any number of good reasons. Alina tried to keep herself busy but found herself freezing up, obsessively checking the sensor readouts. After an hour she tried another pep talk, but faltered after the first couple of sentences. The control team waited in near silence as the day dragged on.\nAfter twelve hours she called the wait off, sent the team home for the night. She stayed at her terminal until her eyes felt like mercury, and slept in her chair.\nThe next day, the station\u2019s comms buoys remained resolutely quiet. Mutterings began to circle around the room: hypotheses about Delta\u2019s mental state, rumours about the outcomes of previous Foundation missions. By the end of the day, Alina had stopped trying to shut them up. She tried to contact Kara, but she was either busy or ignoring the call.\nOn the third day, a full seventy-four hours after the appointed time, Nakamoto called out. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something. Audio!\u201d\nAlina swiped the channel open, eyes wide, breath shallow. She recoiled in horror at the voice coming through the speakers. It was undoubtedly Delta speaking. But this\u2014it wasn\u2019t his voice. This was a reedy, mocking reflection of the cocky baritone she remembered.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting nearly three days,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t got back to me. I don\u2019t know why. I wish you\u2019d tell me why.\u201d\nAlina leaned forward, pulse quickening, breathing hard. Why hadn\u2019t he received their message? The whole room was looking at her, dismay screaming from their faces. She grimaced, hauling her panicking mind under control, and ordered them all to get back to work.\nShe called up the records of five years ago. Could the transmission have been delayed before they\u2019d sent it out? What other explanation was there? Why hadn\u2019t he received it? She ordered a play-by-play rerun of that day\u2019s events. February\u2019s voice was still babbling out of the speakers, darting from sentence to sentence. She stared at her display, half listening.\nThere: that first panicked message from Delta, the accusations of cheating, of poisoning.\n\u201c\u2014thirsty. Forgot to collect any water today. Idiot. Have to wait until tomorrow. Better safe than sorry.\u201d\nThere, she\u2019d opened up a channel and begun to talk to him, soothing him.\n\u201c\u2014hasn\u2019t seen me yet. Haven\u2019t heard from\u2014\u201d\nAnd, there: Kara had updated his trajectory estimate with the ship\u2019s course-corrected data.\n\u201c\u2014either. Should have known there\u2019d\u2014\u201d\nWait.\n\u201c\u2014to be trusted. Could have seen it from the start if I\u2019d been looking\u2014\u201d\nKara had updated his trajectory. After Alina had set up the original comms bearing. After she\u2019d begun transmitting. After the tightbeam uplink had been sent barrelling off into space, a full 0.3528 arcseconds off target.\nNinety-eight millionths of a degree out. Which meant\u2014she made a small, involuntary sound with her throat\u2014which meant that by the time it was due to arrive, the signal had been hurtling into deep space fifty million kilometres away from Delta\u2019s ship. It had never reached him.\nThe room seemed to spiral away from her. She clutched the edge of her desk with both hands. Someone was talking to her, she thought. But she was underwater, and they were up above, on the surface. Shouting at her. She was drowning.\n\u201cHolt!\u201d Nakamoto was saying. \u201cController Holt!\u201d\nReality rushed back, cascading deafeningly around her. She couldn\u2019t seem to find the words to explain to the team. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, kept saying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nDeRogatis marched over to her. \u201cSorry?\u201d he screeched. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? Five years we\u2019ve been waiting! Five years!\u201d\nShe looked at him blankly.\n\u201cDo you know how much work we put into Martin\u2019s crisis management protocols? How much we had riding on today?\u201d\nHer mouth opened and shut. Right now, February Delta\u2014scared, paranoid, and twenty-seven trillion kilometres away\u2014believed he was on his own. Even if they sent another reply today, it would take another three years to reach him. By the time he heard it, he would have been out there, alone, for nearly eleven years.\n\u201cThis was everything!\u201d DeRogatis was yelling. \u201cThere was nowhere else to test those routines! Now we have to sit on our thumbs for another six fucking years!\u201d\nDelta was still talking. He wouldn\u2019t stop talking. \u201c\u2014risk it anymore. Following me everywhere. Got to find a way. Sure he\u2019s tracking me through the suit.\u201d\nThere was a pause, then rustling, punctuated by grunts.\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken the suit off!\u201d one of the doctors called out, then repeated himself, somewhat uselessly. \u201cHe took it off.\u201d\nWithout the zero-g suit, Delta would die before he reached Centauri. It was that simple. A vision of Delta floating through space, body and mind both atrophying beyond repair, drew over Alina like a veil.\nA loud gasp from the speakers. \u201cI saw something,\u201d Delta was whispering. \u201cOne of his cameras, I think.\u201d\nAlina listened, biting her lip. Delta fell silent briefly, and then there was a distant kind of crunching sound, as if from a faraway construction field or a belt-mine.\n\u201cThere,\u201d he said, when his voice returned. \u201cThought I got the last one weeks ago. Sneaky bastard. Have to relocate now. Knows where I am. Still, I\u2019m doing better than him. Couldn\u2019t even keep me out of the food stores. Outsmarted him, oh yes. Smashed him up good.\u201d\nAlina called for a service report on Martin\u2019s systems.\n\u201cCan\u2019t have more than a handful of his functions left these days, not after the number I did on him,\u201d Delta gloated.\nThe tech responded. Martin\u2019s systems: 98.6 percent operational. Superficial damage to visual monitors.\nDelta trailed off. For a while the only sound they could hear was a faint scrabbling. Then he spoke again. \u201cShould be safe here, for now. Need to rest. Delta out.\u201d\nA little later, his heavy breathing turned to a whimpering snore. The transmission continued broadcasting.\nAlina got unsteadily to her feet. She pushed her way past Nakamoto, past Husby, past everyone clamouring for her attention. She made it halfway to the restrooms before throwing up.\nDelta\u2019s paranoid, rambling rant had lasted for a full week before it switched off. Then, silence.\nIn its wake, AI, Medical, and Psych had worked together to improvise another set of instructions for Martin. New, more empathetic conversation routines for the AI; an intensive diet-and-exercise plan to help repair February\u2019s inevitable muscular degradation; the latest antipsychotic drug compounds for the ship\u2019s fabricator to manufacture.\nThey\u2019d called in February\u2019s younger brother, Ved Dexter, to send out a personal plea. That had been Alina\u2019s idea. She had watched him lean in close to the microphone and speak out into the void about shared memories, family stories long past. About how proud he\u2019d felt, almost thirty years earlier, watching Delta take off. She had watched his voice crack and his eyes water, and felt her heart break. She\u2019d temporarily stepped down as mission controller after that; stayed home for a month. She didn\u2019t send Delta anything.\nNow, six and a half years after the worst day of Alina Holt\u2019s life, it was time to see if any of it had made a difference. She didn\u2019t know what to expect. They\u2019d been working blind since his last message. There\u2019d been no further communication from either Martin or February. After this long, even the brightest wells of optimism had all but dried up. The only reason she\u2019d kept her job was because no one else wanted the position.\nBut today they would hear back from him. Assuming he was in any fit state to reply. Assuming he was even alive. Alina sat at her desk, waiting, unsure how to act. She ran her thumbs absently up and down the thin, ridged scars on her wrists.\nFirst the Medical report pinged up. The suit was transmitting data again. Alina pulled up the display with a quick, conservative flick of her hand. The first six years since the previous transmission were a useless flat line, a blank absence of recorded data. But then, three months or so before this message had left the ship, Delta\u2019s vital signs had returned: he had put the suit back on. Columns of data that meant almost nothing to Alina, but whose red-lit exclamation marks and single-digit percentage figures told her unequivocally that the good news was, at best, relative.\nA loud whoop from the AI team told her that Martin was active, too. Next, Husby spoke up. \u201cPayload\u2019s intact.\u201d\nAlina swallowed. \u201cAudio?\u201d she asked.\nA pause. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d\nOne of Husby\u2019s underlings called out: \u201cChief\u2014there\u2019s a video signal, too!\u201d\nAt this distance? Alina\u2019s heart began to pound. \u201cPlay it.\u201d\nA sea of heads swivelled to watch the room\u2019s central holodisplay bring up Delta\u2019s transmission.\nThe signal degradation was visible: blocky pixels of static flared up across the image where the station\u2019s computers were unable to piece together the chunks of data lost to dispersion. But it was Delta all right. Fifty-two, now, but he looked decades older: wrinkles and saggy folds of skin covered his face as he looked half-vacantly into the recorder.\n\u201cHello, Orbital Control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was good to hear from you.\u201d\nHis voice had a kind of distant quality to it, as if he was reading off a script. He sounded hollow, gutted out. Alina held her expression fast as he spoke.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing better than when you last heard from me. My legs and arms don\u2019t work too well, though. All that time without the suit wasn\u2019t good for them. It was hard to eat for a while, too.\u201d February paused, breathing heavily. Alina watched his image as it flickered and popped in the centre of the room. He glanced off to the side, as if searching for his next phrase. \u201cMartin found me down in the nutrient module, eventually. He managed to keep me awake long enough to put the suit back on. And reach the medical bay.\u201d\nA couple of the AI techs started to whisper amongst themselves. Alina glared at them. They ignored her, clustering like bees around one of their colleagues\u2019 terminals.\n\u201cHello-Orbital-Control,\u201d chimed Martin, from somewhere out of view. \u201cI-took-Delta\u2019s-survival-to-be-my-primary-objective. I-am-helping-his-body-repair-the-damage-from-prolonged-sub-terrestrial-gravity.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Delta. \u201cMartin\u2019s fixing me up.\u201d\nThe video image blinked and fizzed briefly. When it returned, his expression had changed. He was leaning in close to the camera. Tears were dribbling down his wrinkled face. He gasped, through quivering lips, \u201cPlease. He\u2019s got me trapped here. I can\u2019t leave the medical bay. He says he\u2019s bringing me back to health, but I don\u2019t know why. You can\u2019t trust him. He lies. Please.\u201d\nMartin\u2019s smooth tones finished up the transmission. \u201cStill-exhibiting-paranoid-tendencies. Further-antipsychotic-medication-may-impair-cognition. Please-advise.\u201d\nThe message ended and the picture faded, until only the faint shimmer of the holoprojector\u2019s standby signal was visible.\nNobody spoke, at first. Those teams who had received the standard data dumps from the ship\u2019s computers\u2014AI, Medical, Exploration\u2014began quietly sifting through their updates. Alina rose to her feet, for no other reason than that she felt she ought to.\n\u201cDelta\u2019s in a bad way,\u201d she began, hoarsely. \u201cBut if Martin can keep him alive for long enough, we might get him through it. I want Psychiatrics in here within the hour. AI, get working on Martin\u2019s routines.\u201d\nOne of the AI techs shouted out, \u201cShit, Holt, we don\u2019t need to. Don\u2019t you get it? Martin was treating Delta before it got our instructions. It figured it out without our help! I\u2019m calling it now: we just programmed ourselves obsolete.\u201d He nudged some of his companions, grinning triumphantly.\nAlina shut her eyes for a few seconds, then continued. \u201cI want all of you working through the night. Delta needs us. This will be our last message to him in-flight. By the time we get his reply, he\u2019ll be coming into orbit around Alpha Centauri.\u201d\nThey set to work.\nHer implant received the call at 05:03, gently stirring her hypothalamus with a thrumming, steady buzz until she awoke.\nPresence required in control room, it said. Unscheduled transmission from February Delta.\nAlina jerked upright, yanking a week-old trapped nerve in her lower back, and winced. Groggily, she grasped the impact of the message. Delta was four years earlier than scheduled. She pulled herself out of bed and made her way over to the closet. She pulled on an old sheepswool sweater. Slid her knotted feet into the first pair of shoes she saw.\nOne last chance to hear from Delta before he arrived. She fed some numbers into her implant. This new message must have been recorded close to three and a half years ago, just after they\u2019d received his pained, frightened video. He would have only just now got their reply. But maybe\u2014maybe, in the meantime, Martin had found a way to soothe his distress. Maybe Delta was doing better. Alina bit back the hopeful smile that threatened to spread across her face.\nAt 05:26 she burst through the doors to face a half-full room of silent workers, all of whom seemed intently fixed on their own displays. No one spoke. No sound came from the speakers hovering near the centre of the ceiling.\nShe looked around, questioning. Husby was on shift; she got up from her station and came to Alina\u2019s side.\nAlina spoke first: \u201cSpit it out, Husby.\u201d\nThe communications manager fidgeted awkwardly. \u201cBetter you hear it yourself, chief.\u201d\nAlina blinked the audio on and started to listen. Delta\u2019s voice came through clearly.\n\u201cOrbital Control, this is February Delta. I thought I\u2019d let you know I\u2019m feeling better now. Arms and legs are almost back to normal, and I\u2019m eating fabricator food again. Figured if Martin really wanted me dead, he\u2019d have left me to it years ago. I\u2019ve been out of the medical bay a few months now, too.\u201d\nAlina wore an expression of deep concentration. He sounded much better than he had in his previous message. But all she could think of was the video\u2019s final frame: that plaintive, tear-streaked mask of despair.\nShe looked down at the side of her desk, where Delta\u2019s old prelaunch publicity shot still sat. But either time or her long-sightedness, or both, had rendered his face impossible to distinguish from the faded paper it was printed on.\n\u201cI play your messages a lot, now,\u201d said Delta. \u201cIt helps to hear your voices. It helps remind me why I\u2019m here, what I\u2019m doing this for. For humanity, right?\u201d\nAlina nudged up the volume.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I know what I\u2019m doing is the right thing. I can\u2019t say why Martin brought me back to health. I haven\u2019t asked him\u2014there\u2019d be no point. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got some instructions for him already on their way. I suppose I don\u2019t blame you: I can\u2019t have looked very\u201d\u2014he paused, searching\u2014\u201cin control, last time.\n\u201cBut whatever he\u2019s planning, I don\u2019t trust him. And whatever you\u2019ve got on its way here\u2014well, there\u2019s always a risk it might not be enough. If Centauri really is the best hope for our future, I\u2019d be doing pretty badly if I let him ruin it, eh?\u201d\nAlina looked around the room. The night crew were busying themselves with routine work. They\u2019d already heard all of this.\n\u201cSo I jettisoned the braking fuel,\u201d said Delta. \u201cTen minutes before I started recording.\u201d\nAlina glanced at Husby; she was already nodding to confirm his claim.\n\u201cThe way I see it, if there\u2019s no way to slow down before we arrive, Martin can\u2019t do any damage. He made a fuss, of course. Didn\u2019t want his grand plan ruined, I suppose. I expect he\u2019s sent a distress call with this transmission. But you mustn\u2019t believe him.\n\u201cAnyway, if I got it right, when we arrive we\u2019ll overshoot the planet and hit Alpha Centauri A dead-on. Ramming into the star at point-one-C ought to finish him off.\u201d\nHe chuckled, which turned into a sigh; a deep, shuddering breath that Alina could feel resonating across the four-year time difference and through her whole body.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry. Sorry I failed the mission. I hope someone else can do better than I did.\n\u201cDelta out.\u201d\nThe feed went dead.\nAlina set her jaw. There was no time to lose. She steadied herself against her desk and began to bark out orders.\n\u201cHusby, call in AI and Navigation, right now. The fuel tank won\u2019t be going much slower than the ship. If we do this right, we can get Martin to recouple and brake them both into orbit around Centauri.\u201d She breathed in. \u201cThis is it, everyone. We\u2019ll land him safely in that system if it\u2019s the last thing we do.\u201d\nThe control team remained motionless.\n\u201cWell? You\u2019ve got your orders. Get moving!\u201d\n\u201cChief,\u201d said Husby, \u201cthere\u2019s no point.\u201d\nAlina whirled towards her, her face twisted with fury. Then she understood what Husby meant. Delta was almost four light-years away. Anything they sent at this point\u2014instructions, advice, even a good-bye\u2014would get there almost a month after Delta had barrelled into the distant sun.\nShe stared, for a while, at the projection and the neon-blue trail that marked Delta\u2019s progress. Then she turned it off.\nSection Director Alina Holt was sitting up in bed, teasing straight the sleep-tousled kinks and curls of her bone-white hair. When she was finished, she slid her legs over the edge of the mattress and got slowly to her feet. She\u2019d selected the outfit last night. A neutral navy suit. Black had seemed too macabre.\nHusby got up to greet her as she entered the control room. \u201cPleasure to see you, Alina,\u201d she said.\nAlina raised a sarcastic eyebrow and walked over to the main projector. She settled herself into a seat and let the sounds of the control room wash over her. From time to time her implant blinked messages and reminders to her. She waved them away. They could wait.\nEventually Husby signalled Alina. \u201cIt\u2019s time, boss.\u201d\nAlina thanked her and called up the display.\nLuminosity, she told it.\nAlpha Centauri A, it said. 584.207 yottawatts.\nShe watched and waited.\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Husby, after a few moments, and the display blurred a little in front of her.\n584.207.\nAlina turned to Husby and smiled. \u201cI thought it might\u2014\u201d she began, then looked away. \u201cThanks, anyway.\u201d\nHusby helped her to her feet and touched her on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll do better next time,\u201d she said.\nWhen Alina reached her office, she slumped into her chair. She pulled out a small, white rectangle of paper from her desk, turned it over in her hands a couple of times, and then replaced it in its drawer. It was over.\nBut it had been over for more than four years now. The information reaching the sensors was history. Or so maybe it had been longer than that: Delta\u2019s good-bye, almost nine years ago, had signified the end, the failure, of the mission. But even then\u2014although she hadn\u2019t known it at the time\u2014that good-bye had been almost four years old itself. Twelve and a half years ago he\u2019d jettisoned the fuel. And only now could she see, could she really know, that it was over.\nOr, she thought\u2014maybe it wasn\u2019t. Delta was gone, there was no question about that. But the Foundation remained. The threat remained. Centauri was still there, a distant beacon of hope. Alina opened up her holodisplay and pulled through the morning\u2019s messages. \u201cAugust Lambda,\u201d she said into the mouthpiece, and the alerts reshuffled themselves in response. She began to read.\nThere was work to do.\nBenjamin Sherlock is from Brighton (England) and currently lives in London (the same).

The dead spoke, though they shouldn\u2019t have. And I listened, though I didn\u2019t want to. I wish my fingers were thin metal wires that could dig deep into my ears and tear away their voices. Were this journal a diary of oblivion I would write until I dissolved them into ink and paper.\nLt. Sheely arrived at our camp at 10 a.m. I was doing the laundry in the olive grove when he found me. He said he needed me for some tricky business back in town. When I asked what it was about, he didn\u2019t answer. Nevertheless I followed him. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\nThe town is called Lucer\u00eca and it is just six miles from our camp. Though I saw nothing of the destruction I had witnessed in Foggia, the city had been hit by a B-17 two weeks ago. After a while, I could see we were heading for a school, an old three-story building. The lower floors were still intact, but the upper ones were devastated.\nMuch of the debris had been cleaned up, but the place was still in shambles. On the ground floor, the war correspondents had set up their pressroom in the school refectory. The walls and ceiling are hand painted and quite incredible. Beside the usual saints and Madonnas are some creatures the likes of which I\u2019d never seen: they soar in the air, slither under the ground, walk through flames and water; some have claws, many have mouths, all have blood-golden eyes. What are they? They seemed so otherworldly, and yet somehow familiar. I was still nose in the air when Sheely introduced me to Pvt. Stephens. He was to be my guide in the school. I noticed his hands, strong and rough, outdoor hands. When I asked why I would need a guide, Sheely replied:\n\u201cHe was the one who found them.\u201d\nBefore I could ask who \u2018them\u2019 was, we climbed the stairs up to the second floor, where Pvt. Stephens called for Sorella Serena. A few minutes later a limping child came out. It took me a few moments to realize this was no child, but a dwarf. In his terrible Italian, Stephens asked this dwarf-nun about some keys, but she was upset.\n\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t bring anyone else,\u201d she said in Italian.\nAt that I replied I was there to help. The dwarf-nun was startled.\n\u201cAre you Apulian?\u201d she asked. She had the sweetest voice.\nI told her I was not, but that my grandmother was. At this, she seemed to calm down and led us, limping, through a drab corridor. She halted in front of a small door and opened it with a rusty key.\nThe dorm was in almost total darkness (Italian shutters are thick wooden panels, not our thin curtains). There was the strangest smell, like one you would expect to find in a barn and not a first aid station. Slowly, I made out twelve beds. Not one was empty.\nI\u2019ve seen dead children more than once since coming overseas, but this was very different. Part of it was that their heads were all covered in bandages. They also had a strange, bird-like quality; like frail human-chicks that had been shot by mistake. Pvt. Stephens shone a flashlight over the closest bed while Sheely unwrapped the boy\u2019s bandages. It was bad, but not the kind of bad I was expecting.\nThe boy had no nose. All the skin had been peeled from his scalp. There were burns on the torso too, but these didn\u2019t look recent. The mouth was most shocking. Little as it was, it looked like a gaping chasm. Right then they spoke. All of them. It was just a whisper but one I knew too well, for I had heard it countless times in the aid stations.\n\u201cAcqua,\u201d they said. Water.\nWhy did they talk? The dead should not talk.\nAs we came out, Sheely handed me a letter.\nThe letter\u2014from Gen. Fawkes\u2014listed the casualties from the school\u2019s bombing: six nuns and twenty-seven children. However, an additional twelve boys had also been extracted from the debris. Barely alive, but still, alive. And this is the thing: no one in town claimed them. No father or mother, no aunt or grandmother, no one at all.\nLt. Sheely asked me if I wanted to help them to find the boys\u2019 relatives. I told him I would think about it.\n10\/6\/44\nI woke up in the middle of the night. In the distance, an owl screeched like a man\u2019s throat was cut in mid-scream. In the dark of the orchard I kept seeing the boys\u2019 mouths. I tried all the old tricks, but sleep would not come. At last, one of Grandma\u2019s lullabies came to me.\nTraso chiano chiano esto sott o divano . . .\nSi traso cchi\u00f9 vvicino i \u2018vengo \u2018nta cucina . . .\nPo \u2018traso \u2018e renza \u2018e renza e sto \u2018ncopp \u2018a credenza,\nma \u2018a notte pe\u2019dispietto me metto appier \u201co lietto.\nI enter quietly and hide under the sofa . . .\nIf I come closer I come into the kitchen . . .\nThen I come in and hide on the hutch,\nbut at night, when I arrive, I stand by your bed.\nI didn\u2019t have a bed, but I imagined I was in one and a dark human shape knelt down inside my tent, a hand over my head. \u201cDuorme,\u201d said Grandma\u2019s voice.\n\u201cSleep.\u201d And in my dream, I slept.\nThey don\u2019t love us here. This isn\u2019t like Naples or even Palermo. In Lucer\u00eca people walk past without looking you in the eye; and when they do, you wish they hadn\u2019t. I can\u2019t blame them. Adults, I don\u2019t mind, they can stare as much as they want. But when children do, then I can\u2019t bear it; especially children Junior\u2019s age.\nFirst thing in the morning I went to town, to the Madri Pie school. Sheely wasn\u2019t there but Pvt. Stephens was. I could tell he was surprised to see me again. The lieutenant had asked two other macaroni before me. Stephens told me that I was a better choice because \u201cyou can speak the dialect of your people.\u201d I bit my lips but I didn\u2019t reply.\nWe climbed upstairs to bring water to the wounded. Stephens had to ask the dwarf-nun\u2019s permission to enter their quarters during the day. Sorella Serena is the school\u2019s headmaster. She was one of the three nuns who survived the blast, and had stayed behind to look after the damaged building. In spite of her size, she gives an impression of boundless energy. She never asks the other sisters to run an errand, but always does it herself; carrying buckets, or even wood for the stove. Her hands are small and hard: farmer\u2019s hands, though they can perform acts of tremendous beauty. The Sorella plays an ancient kind of box-harp called a psaltery. I heard it only once, for the evening Angelus, and I must say I\u2019d never heard a sound so exquisite.\nAs soon as we entered the dorm I wanted to be outside. I couldn\u2019t bear to look at them, or even to hear them breathing; it was as if with every breath they suffocated me. As I shuffled around the room, I asked Stephens how much morphine they were given. He said they were given none. When I told him that without morphine we would\u2019ve heard them screaming from the camp, he replied that in fact we did.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear them last night? They always wake up at twilight. Then we do use morphine to keep them in their beds.\u201d\nAll Stephens\u2019s attention was on the bodies now. First he removed their bandages, then cleaned them with a sponge. Finally he gave them water, holding their heads up like a mother to a sick child. Some had burns, some stab scars, some bruises around their necks, some pockmarks, some scabs on their arms. All different, yet all old scars. Only their facial wounds looked recent. Like someone had skinned them with a knife. Then I noticed their hands. I hadn\u2019t noticed them before. The fingers were clawed, the nails thick and sharp, like animals.\nThe guys from the press-room opened up a bit when I told them about my janitor job for the Providence Herald.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost colleagues then!\u201d laughed Sgt. Aaron from Yank magazine. While we were having a smoke, I asked them who had pulled the boys from the debris. They didn\u2019t know. When Stephens found them, they were already where I saw them, in their beds.\nI asked if anyone had looked for their parents. Sgt. Aaron nodded. Sheely went through all the school records and went around to get the students\u2019 mothers one by one and brought them here, so they could claim the boys. But the women didn\u2019t claim them. They said their sons were already buried and showed Sheely their bodies.\n\u201cThen who the hell are they?\u201d I asked.\nThe sergeant shrugged. He told me that maybe the mothers didn\u2019t want the boys back because they were disfigured.\n\u201cOr maybe because of some hocus-pocus curse.\u201d\nHe said that while visiting the dorm, some of the women made the sign to ward off evil. Did he think the children were cursed?\n\u201cThe villagers do. You saw them, they\u2019re like animals.\u201d\nAt that Sgt. Molly pulled him back and whispered something in his ear. Aaron laughed. He said he didn\u2019t know. Then he asked me how I felt about killing my own people.\n\u201cThey are not my people. I only speak their language,\u201d I said.\n10\/7\/44\nDead of night. Woke up to the same distant cries. I got out of my tent and used my binoculars. I hadn\u2019t realized you could see the Madri Pie from the camp. There it was, a lit window surrounded by darkness on all sides. Did I see childlike shadows? And their cries, they didn\u2019t sound human at all. Maybe they\u2019re only owls. Maybe.\nSomething funny happened when I lay down. I was murmuring Grandma\u2019s lullaby when I heard someone repeat it, in the dark. I sat up, all hot and cold. Probably a prank. Thinking about it, though, I don\u2019t know any soldier in my outfit who could fake Apulian dialect.\nIn Italy, all the kids chase you in the streets calling you \u201cJoe.\u201d\n\u201cHey Joe! Bis-quits! Bis-quits Joe!\u201d they cry.\nBack in Naples I saw US officers throwing packets of crackers at them just to see what would happen. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching pigeons fight,\u201d one once told me. I never have crackers with me. And I always try not to speak Italian in the street. If I do, they flock after me.\nBut here in Lucer\u00eca things are different. Maybe because compared with the children in Foggia, kids here are well fed. But they\u2019re more wary too, they size you up before approaching.\nI sat under a fig tree and watched some kids playing sassolini just behind the Madri Pie. After a while, a boy of about fifteen came up to me. He was dressed in US army shorts, socks, and shirt, all too big for him. The shoes were grotesquely huge, he waddled in them. The boy asked me if I wanted to play. He showed me how: one person throws a handful of stones in the air and the other has to catch them. The first one to drop a stone loses the game. The boy threw up three pebbles. I caught them all. This surprised the kids; they didn\u2019t think I had understood. Other children arrived in the square and began to cheer. We were up to six stones when the boy dropped one. When he realized he had lost, his face flushed. Then he scowled at me and shouted, \u201cBut can you do this Joe? Can you?\u201d\nHe took his shoes off and began walking on his hands. He did it as naturally as if he was walking on his feet. All the children were cheering at him like mad. Finally I smiled and said, \u201cNo, non posso.\u201d No, I can\u2019t.\nTalked with Lt. Sheely. He confirmed the correspondents\u2019 stories. No one had claimed the wounded. Worse than that, no one in town had even approached the Madre Pie since the bombing. Then Sheely asked me if I believed there was something odd about the boys.\n\u201cYou mean, besides their face wounds? No. Do you?\u201d\nHe nodded. The boys were mostly comatose during the day. But at dusk, they sort of woke up. \u201cThen they,\u201d he began but could not bring himself to finish. He looked at me with the strangest intensity.\n\u201cCan I stay the night, in the dorm?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSure, if you convince the sorella and Stephens. Good luck.\u201d\n\u201cIs there something about Stephens you wish to tell me, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI dunno. He seems rather \u2018off\u2019 if you don\u2019t mind me saying so.\u201d\nSheely smiled bitterly.\n\u201cHis outfit was destroyed. When he came here he was a broken man, he could hardly speak or sleep. His discovery of the children changed everything. He thinks he\u2019s their appointed \u2018protector\u2019 and he utterly clings to them. I think he\u2019s became a sort of addict.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he \u2018abuse substances\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI wish it were that simple. Ask him. Ask him to stay.\u201d\n10\/8\/44\nIt isn\u2019t true that the townspeople in Lucer\u00eca always shun us. Yesterday evening, at dusk, a small group of washerwomen came to our camp. They didn\u2019t say a word, but took our clothes and did the washing for us in the creek. They didn\u2019t want our money or\u2014and this is rather exceptional\u2014our food. They never smiled, and left without a grazie.\nI found Stephens at the fountain and asked him permission to sleep in the dorm with them. He shook his head slowly, like a bull.\n\u201cThey only need one ward. And you would spill it to the guys.\u201d\nSince I couldn\u2019t make any sense of his answer, I asked him about home. He is a Westerner, so it took him a while to loosen up. He was born in Missouri, but moved to Twin Falls when he was sixteen and had worked as a ranch hand ever since. He is twenty-eight and unmarried.\n\u201cWhen I go back,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll buy a nice piece of land. It\u2019s all right to be working as a ranch hand, but it can\u2019t last forever. When you get older you kinda like a place of your own.\u201d\nStephens had it all planned out. He\u2019d seen a piece of land just behind the last farm he worked for. I asked him to describe it to me, but he just looked up and frowned.\n\u201cEven England is hard for me to remember. And that was way before Naples, before Sicily, before Africa even. . . .\u201d he said.\nHe knew for a fact that there is a town called Twin Falls, where he\u2019d lived for twelve years. He remembers his friends there, his family, the girl he had wanted to marry. But he couldn\u2019t remember the land. Not the hills or the brooks or woods or lake. If he tried, all he saw was Apulia; as if these sun-burnt plains had swallowed his memory whole.\nI nodded. This is quite common among soldiers\u2014at least the ones I know. You are fighting your way home, but after a while you\u2019re not quite sure what home looks like. All you have is faded pictures.\nStephens laughed and said he\u2019s got a lot more than that. When I asked him to explain himself, he changed subject. He asked me what I most looked forward to seeing when I got back.\n\u201cI guess that would be Junior,\u201d I said.\nI told him that my wife had our first baby just after I had left, and that he was three years old now but I\u2019d never seen him or heard him speak, and that he\u2014and his mother\u2014are all I want to come back to. Stephens asked me if I felt at home here. There are other macaronis who took to the old country like ducks to the water.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Junior and your wife,\u201d he said, \u201cwould you stay here? It\u2019s the land of your fathers after all.\u201d\nI smiled his question off but he didn\u2019t smile back. That somehow upset me. I told him I didn\u2019t have to justify myself, that I\u2019m an American soldier just like he is, and I left.\nAs I came out of the school I saw the dwarf-nun standing on a low wall. She was making herself taller to scold the boy with huge US army shoes. The boy\u2019s head was bent and the nun\u2019s voice vibrated him in long shudders. When he saw me, his chin shot up with a smile.\n\u201cNonna nonna, did you know this Joe here is Italiano?\u201d\nThe nun turned to reassure me that she was just his grandma\u2019s sister, not his grandma. I told her that my name wasn\u2019t Joe either.\n\u201cAngelo,\u201d I said, and shook the boy\u2019s hand. His jaw dropped.\n\u201cBut I am Angelo too!\u201d he burst out.\n\u201cThen I\u2019m Big Angelo and you\u2019re Little Angelo,\u201d I said.\nHe was so happy that we had the same name, that at once he began walking on his hands. Quick as a wasp, the nun struck him on his back with a willow switch. The boy fell on his side\u2014he looked at me like a scared cat\u2014then scampered inside the school.\n\u201cWhy, Sorella?\u201d I asked. The nun looked at me warily, her concern mixed with pride.\n\u201cAngelo was here when the bomb hit the school. It was God\u2019s hand that saved him. But even God\u2019s patience has limits. One day he might do something foolhardy just to impress the likes of you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he with his mom and dad?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cMy\u2014\u201d she said, then changed in mid-sentence \u201c\u2014they all died in Foggia, under your bombs. He and I, we are the only family left.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t look her in the eye when she said this. Instead I inquired about the wounded. Didn\u2019t she recognize them? The nun quietly shook her head and said they were too disfigured. Not even by their voices? They had been struck mute by the bombing, she said.\n\u201cStephens said they scream at night. And I heard them speak.\u201d\nShe said she never had. This was the first outright lie she had told me. Quickly, she added that Stephens was a bit lunatic.\n\u201cThen why did you give him permission to sleep with them?\u201d\nThe nun scowled at me.\n\u201cThis he must tell you himself.\u201d\n10\/12\/44\nThe night screams we hear coming from the Madre Pie are becoming unbearable. The guys are beginning to notice them too. Some say they are foxes, or owls, or wolves, but there are quite a lot of farmers in the infantry and you can\u2019t fool a farmer, even in a foreign land. Only, it\u2019s not just the screams. There are rumors that our outfit is going to Anzio, where the big action is. I\u2019m not sure it is a bad thing for us. These days the guys talk about home obsessively. We all have a pet incantation, one we know by heart. Just yesterday Simmons said to Lt. Kip, \u201cWhen Angelo sees his Junior,\u201d meaning: when we all go home.\nYet sometimes the guys here are a bit like Stephens, you can see in their eyes that they can\u2019t fully remember what they go on and on about. It\u2019s as if everything they\u2019ve been longing for\u2014their hometowns, their wives, even their children\u2014has somehow become unreal to them; like a fairy tale they tell themselves over and over again, afraid that one day they will forget.\n10\/16\/44\nI spent four afternoons in Lucer\u00eca talking to as many relatives of those who died in the bombing as I could. Though their loss is recent they were usually able to talk about their loved ones, the men with faces set in stone, and the women in low voices. Most are farmers with large families, so losing a child is something they\u2019ve taken into account. But when I asked about the twelve boys, their behavior changed. Some simply showed me the door. Others changed the subject and refused to come back to it. Not a few made the horned shaped hand, sticking out their index and pinkie fingers to ward off evil. An old woman even took a pinch of salt and threw it behind me as I left.\nMost were scared, but not all. Some of the children listened, wide-eyed, at any mention of the wounded. One of them, a girl of about six, followed me out to the patio and uttered a single word.\n\u201cNocturnals,\u201d she said, and scuttled back inside.\nLast night, Grandma\u2019s stories kept me company as I lay awake in my tent. I saw them, among the tree branches. The Nuriae, who strangle unwary lovers in their own bedsheets; Wyrms, coiled around their treasures in the deep wells; Urchins, who swoop down chimneys to wreak their joyous mayhem; blind Garaudi, who will steal your left eye if you can\u2019t solve their riddles. They all came back to me: Nocturnals.\nThat\u2019s what Grandma called them. She told us that in the States, night is tame. But back in the old country, darkness is as thick as the sea. And in that sea live Nocturnals. Some were born, some unborn; all are stories. They tell them at the Vigils, by the light of green lanterns. And once they are told, Nocturnals crawl out of their dark sea and walk into our land, in the flesh.\nDead of the night. I must have fallen asleep after all, because I remember waking up with a jerk. I wasn\u2019t the only one. Others were pointing at the small-lit window surrounded by darkness. The screams came at us in waves, washing over us like a dark tide, pulling us in.\n10\/18\/44\nI saw Little Angelo again. He\u2019s the errand boy of the Madri Pie; he sweeps the floors and helps clean the debris from the upper floors. Whenever he\u2019s out of the nun\u2019s sight, he walks on his hands. That drives our guys wild and they give him chocolates and cigarettes. The more soldiers cheer him on, the more reckless he becomes. Only the other day, I saw him walking on the ledge of a second floor balcony, just to get a laugh from two officers. When his \u201cgrandma\u201d heard what happened she beat him black and blue. Little Angelo submitted without a sound. He knows he means the world to her.\nLater he told me that\u2014a few days before the bombing\u2014he had fallen from that same balcony. Dottor Mandelli said he was done for, and they even sent for the priest. But that was also his luck. It was because they had moved him into the chapel downstairs that he wasn\u2019t killed by the blast. Two days later he was back on his feet.\n\u201cI am charmed,\u201d he grinned.\nI quite like the little guy. When I am at the school he follows me around like a duckling. Annoying as hell, but you can\u2019t be mad at him for long. He is thirsty for anything American. He memorizes every name I throw at him: John Wayne, Lionel Barrymore, James Cagney. He loves the sound of American names, he chews on them as if they were bubble-gum and says when the war is over he\u2019ll go living in the land of Joes. That made me laugh. Only when I inquired about the boys upstairs, would he start gnawing at his nails\u2014which he only does when very upset. When I asked him if the boys upstairs scared him, he nodded. Oddly, I didn\u2019t believe him. In fact, when I talked about them, he looked out of the window with the same bittersweet longing our guys have when they talk about home.\n11\/19\/44\nThe washerwomen came back. This time there were dozens of them. They took all the unwashed clothes from our camp and walked off. We haven\u2019t seen them or our clothes again yet. And it\u2019s not just a few shirts I am talking about, it\u2019s literally buckets of them. Some soldiers searched in the shrubbery but couldn\u2019t find a single footprint. Sgt. Peake joked that next time we saw them, we should shoot on sight.\nYesterday at chow time I found Little Angelo in line for food and handed him a pair of shoes his size. I had a theory, which later proved to be true, that the reason Little Angelo walked on his hands so often was because it was easier than walking in those huge shoes.\nThe nun was there when I handed him the new pair. I was afraid she wouldn\u2019t let him accept my gift, but she did. The little guy was so happy he danced in front of the chow line, to the amusement of the war correspondents. But as soon as Little Angelo left, the nun took me aside. She led me to the small chapel\u2014hewn in white stone; a beauty\u2014where the nuns usually pray. As the sorella absent-mindedly stroked her box-harp, she asked if I had a son. When I said that I did, she smiled.\n\u201cThen I hope you will understand. I see what you are trying to do and I can\u2019t let you do it. Don\u2019t you ever talk to my grandson again.\u201d\nLater on, I learned that the nun tried to convince Sheely to ask another macaroni for help. \u201cThat\u2019s fine by me,\u201d I told him.\n\u201cIt was only a suggestion,\u201d he began, but didn\u2019t finish. His office windows had begun to shudder; the roar from outside was deafening. The war correspondents ran out, with us on their heels. We looked up. It came straight from our base, the biggest B-17 formation I\u2019d ever seen. They were headed for Germany, Sheely said, to Berlin. The townspeople were coming out in the streets, too; girls clutching each other\u2019s arms, farmers shielding their eyes with their hats. It didn\u2019t matter if the B-17s weren\u2019t for them, their dread was still palpable. There was one little girl \u2014about six\u2014clutching her father\u2019s arm, she stared right at me. Not at Sheely, just at me. I will never forget her look. It was as if she were saying: \u201cWhat you did to us wasn\u2019t enough? You must do it to others as well?\u201d I wanted to tell her that it wasn\u2019t us who started all this\u2014and most of all, it wasn\u2019t me\u2014but I didn\u2019t.\nWhen we came back, Sheely lit a cigar.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are to them,\u201d he said. \u201cA replacement of the Germans. I want to prove them wrong, Bisaccia. Finding the relatives of those twelve boys is a small thing, but it\u2019s the least we can do.\u201d\n\u201cI read you loud and clear, sir, but I\u2019m stuck. I\u2019ve made no progress. If you want to call someone else, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cI never said I would. You think it\u2019s enough to speak Italian? Even the two other guys whose parents are from Naples can\u2019t understand this town or its people. But you . . . you have a way with this community. That\u2019s why I need you, Bisaccia. I\u2019ve received an invitation to a Vigil tomorrow. You\u2019ll come with me as my translator and to keep an open ear. Someone did something terrible to those boys, and I bet my yearly wage it wasn\u2019t us or the Germans. Help me send them home.\u201d\n11\/20\/44\nTwo soldiers didn\u2019t come back last night. They\u2019ll wait another twelve hours before sending search parties. Maybe they\u2019re simply off somewhere, drunk. Of course they could have been captured, or killed in a mine field. A sign of ill omen, however you put it. In the camp the guys play cards in silence; they don\u2019t even talk about home. Truth is, we have been stranded for too long. The sooner we leave, the better.\nI first heard about the Vigils from Grandma. That\u2019s what they call it here when people gather at night to tell stories. Sheely and I could see the green lanterns from afar; the barn was full of them. It was impressive, watching that emerald glow reflected on dozens of faces. I didn\u2019t expect to see so many. When the Teller began, the silence was absolute. Translating was difficult. What came out of my mouth was poor in tone and content, while the Teller\u2019s stories were full of nuances, holding a subtle mixture of humor and horror. Sheely frowned often as he listened. Surely, the children would not laugh at an Urchin skinning a spinster alive, or at a Garaude ripping out the eye of a young man who failed to solve his Riddle, or at a Wyrm slaughtering an entire town on a whim. But those stories were entertaining precisely because they were crude and outrageous. And the more I translated them, the more I entered into their world, and the more I seemed to understand them.\nWhen we returned to the Madri Pie, my mind was on fire. I asked Sheely for permission to sleep in the pressroom, claiming I was too tired to head back to camp. But that was a lie. I had a little notebook and I was eager to fill it with as many stories I could.\nI stayed up for an hour, writing by a flashlight on my table. I stopped only when I heard a din from upstairs. Suddenly I remembered where I was. But the soul-rending screams did not come. It was too late in the night for that. Instead I heard two distinct noises. First, a man sobbing. And then, the sound of an instrument, maybe a harp.\nAs I turned back to the pressroom, my flashlight lit up the frescoed vaults of the refectory. I had become so accustomed to them that I almost didn\u2019t notice them anymore. There were the Madonnas and saints, all performing miracles. But among the latter were some very odd creatures: vagrants with cloaks made of eyes; washerwomen with faces like closed orchids; hedgehogs with the bodies of children; and Wyrms and Wyccae and Storm-Riders and Tarantulas and Lizard-Gnomes, and many, many more. However, when I looked closer, I could see the inscription for the foundation of the Madri Pie written under the arch of the main vault.\nBut instead of the word scuola, it read: PIOUS MOTHERS 1756, ROYAL ORPHANAGE.\n10\/21\/44\n\u201cThey are orphans. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t find their parents.\u201d\nLt. Sheely wheeled around his chair and stared at me.\n\u201cBisaccia, are you drunk?\u201d he said.\nAfter I had convinced him I wasn\u2019t, he listened to what I had to say and very calmly began to demolish my arguments, one by one:\n\u201cFirst, even if the school really was an orphanage, it hasn\u2019t been one for a long time. I\u2019m talking centuries here, not years. And second: if the Madri Pie still housed orphans, why didn\u2019t the nuns recognize them? Even in their present state, they would\u2019ve known them.\u201d\nThis was the only thing we did agree upon. The nuns should have recognized them, but they didn\u2019t. Why?\nAnd so I questioned the nuns. There were only the three of them. Suor Maria has a face like a slab stone and didn\u2019t say much at all. I could see she was scared. Though not of the orphans or me: she was scared of the dwarf-nun, her superior. Suor Elisa is a different story.\nShe is a very tall woman, painfully thin and horse-faced. At once she confirmed that it was Suor Serena who had locked the wounded boys in the dorm. But when I asked her if she had ever seen or heard them before the bombing, her lips flashed a tiny smile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just old peasant stories, really,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say that at night they still come in this place, where they once lived, centuries ago. Suor Maria says sometimes she hears a little bump in the dark, late at night. And the next day the broom isn\u2019t where you left it. They also might mess around with food in the pantry, leave jam smeared on the kitchen table. Sometimes though, they clean for you, or bring gifts, like eggs or necklaces made of shells. If you cross them, they\u2019ll steal your things and you\u2019ll never find what they took unless they want you to. But they aren\u2019t evil,\u201d the sister continued with a smile. \u201cIn fact, they can be very kind. They\u2019re children after all, orphans and protectors of lonely souls. It is said that when you can\u2019t sleep, they sit on your bed and put their hands on your head, until you finally fall asleep.\u201d\nI ran into Angelo just outside the school, playing with the other kids. We went into the pressroom together. As I lit him a cigarette, I told him I had been at a Vigil. Could he help me recognize the Nocturnals? His eyes widened. After a while he pointed at the fresco.\n\u201cThe Nuriae. They are the old river\u2019s daughters, the lovers of the mad Baron of Twilight. If you ever see their true faces, you die.\u201d\nI pointed again. I could sense his uneasiness growing.\n\u201cThe Garaudi,\u201d he replied in one breath. \u201cLong dead smiths and riddle-masters, and slaves to the Duke of Under-Earth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd these?\u201d I finally asked.\nI was pointing to a group\u2014or rather, a flock\u2014of boy-shaped creatures hovering over the rooftops of a painted town. They were playing pranks, hiding keys or shoes or books behind the chimneys, just as children would; but they were not children. Their torsos were human, and they wore small red caps on the tops of their heads, yet they had snouts like those of hedgehogs, all spines and mischievousness.\nAngelo didn\u2019t say another word. I knew that in a little while he would talk, that he would tell me his secret. But then\u2014suddenly\u2014the boy threw his cigarette on the ground and bolted outside. A duster in her hands, Sorella Serena was staring at me with eyes of quiet danger.\n10\/22\/44\nI enter quietly and hide under the sofa . . .\nIf I come closer I come into the kitchen . . .\nThen I come in and hide on the hutch,\nbut at night, when I arrive, I stand by your bed.\nI know now that these lines were about them.\nGrandma never said their names, but I remember her telling me to behave or they would steal my toys. At night, when I heard the old cupboards creak, it was them hiding. It was them who whispered under my bed. It was them who pulled my hair when I wasn\u2019t looking, them who giggled in the dark. But when I couldn\u2019t sleep, they would climb on my bed, put their hands on my head, and lull me into oblivion.\nI wish it would work now. Ever since last May, I can only sleep a few hours at a time. And then there are the screams. Tonight I heard them again and used my binoculars. Was it my imagination or did I really see them? Small hands, pressed on the glass. They flocked to the window like trapped birds, praying for a freedom that would not come.\nMy head is full with their screams. I put my hands to ears, but I can still hear them, loud and clear.\nThey found the two soldiers not far from the creek, strangled. No one is supposed to know, but we do anyway: they had no clothes on.\nI can\u2019t believe it was the townspeople. Of course as a macaroni I\u2019m in no position to voice my opinion. I\u2019ve noticed the stares, the casual remarks. I know what they lead to, so I asked Lt. Peake for leave to go to town for a couple of days, though I knew what he would say.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Anzio soon. You\u2019ll never see this place again.\u201d\nOf course. But then I remember what Stephens told me at the school, about me feeling at home here. He was right. It\u2019s not the barren landscape and it\u2019s not the people. It\u2019s more\u2014I don\u2019t know. The stories? Or some ancestral memory, the feeling of having had roots deeper than blood? Or maybe something simpler, something I can\u2019t admit to. I try hard to think of Jenny and Junior, but when I try to speak their names aloud they become ash in my mouth. Instead, I say another name.\nIt sounds like mine, but it isn\u2019t.\nI was preparing my gear when I heard a new ruckus. The guys were running from all sides, so it took me a while to understand what was going on. Our clothes were back. Perfectly clean, as good as new. No one had seen the washerwomen bring them. Sgt. Peake sent five men into the thickets. I have a hunch they won\u2019t find anyone.\n10\/24\/44\nThe school was declared off limits for me.\nStephens broke the news with a satisfied grin. Apparently I\u2019d been accused of stealing some documents about the old orphanage. Stephens said the sorella made it clear to Sheely that if I set foot on the premises again she\u2019d ask the bishop to file a report with our general. I didn\u2019t even protest, I just took my stuff and set off for town.\nIt took me all day to find her, but I did. Eventually a carpenter told me she has a vegetable stall at the market in Piazza Mercato.\nWhen the women saw me, they flocked. They thought I wanted to sell some of my stuff. I tried to convince them this was not the case, but as soon as they heard me speak their dialect it got worse. Was it true the US army would bomb Lucer\u00eca because of the two dead soldiers? I shook my head and kept on repeating I just wanted to speak with Nina, like an incantation: finally it worked. All of a sudden there was someone at my shoulder. In spite of her young face, her hair was of the starkest white. I didn\u2019t recognize her until she spoke; but the voice, deep and husky, was the voice of the tales told by the fire.\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d asked the Teller.\nNina\u2019s house is a mile from the Madri Pie, in borgo San Matteo. Her husband had been drafted three years prior and had not come back. The barn wasn\u2019t very big, but since the cattle is gone there is plenty of room for one man to sleep. After she handed me a blanket, Nina lit up a green lantern\u2014the same one she used at the Vigil.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t stand this shade of green,\u201d she said, \u201cSo if you talk about them, they can\u2019t hear their name spoken and trace it back to you.\u201d\nI told her I wanted to know more about the Urchins, the children of Twilight. She smiled and said they are tricksters and free-spirited, the souls of orphans long dead. They were adopted by one of the Night\u2019s secret lords, the Queen of Dawn. It is said that one day the Queen, walking on the borders of Day with her retinue of fairy wrens, took pity on a dying street orphan. And so, in her generosity, she tore a patch from her blood-red shawl, which is woven from dawn itself, and out of that piece she asked her wrens to weave a red cap. It is said at the Vigils that\u2014from that Dawn\u2014if a dying orphan has the free spirit of an Urchin he is given a red cap to become one of them, to play with the flock for all eternity, wherever they chose.\n\u201cEven in a monastery? Or in a school?\u201d\nAs soon as I asked she stood up, her eyes shining in emerald.\n\u201cI know who you are! You are that soldier who keeps them locked up. Do you really think you can cage them like birds?\u201d\nI tried to explain that it was not me, but she didn\u2019t listen.\n\u201cDo you understand what you have done? They are furious, all of them. You\u2019ve trapped their brethren like beasts! Do you think it\u2019s only coincidence two of your men have died? There are things worse than death and they know them all! I want you out of my barn, now!\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what came over me. All I wanted to do was to shut her mouth, but before I knew it my teeth were on her lips. I bit her until I could taste blood. She tried to bite me back but I pushed her, I pinned her down with all my weight. As I began to kiss her she went limp. At this, I froze. I rolled off of her, my face in my hands. I expected her to bolt out of the barn or to call for help, but she didn\u2019t do either.\n\u201cI am not,\u201d I said at last, \u201cthe one who keeps them locked up. All I want is for them to go home. And for my mates to stop dying.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t reply, but when I looked up I saw that she believed me. She wiped the fresh blood from her lips. Then\u2014as if nothing had happened\u2014she asked me whether anything unusual had occurred in our camp before the death of my companions. I told her nothing had, except\u2014maybe\u2014the washerwomen stealing our clothes. She looked up.\n\u201cWasherwomen. Did they come at night?\u201d\n\u201cNo, they\u2014wait, it was late evening, almost dusk.\u201d\n\u201cThen you are all doomed. In Lucer\u00eca no living woman would dream of washing clothes at dusk. Only the Baron of Twilight\u2019s lovers.\u201d\n\u201cI am positive they were just women and very much alive.\u201d\n\u201cDescribe them to me then. What did their faces look like?\u201d\nI opened my mouth, but nothing came out. Then, as if my effort had broken an invisible wall, it all came back to me. It wasn\u2019t that I failed to remember their faces: they had none. No mouths, no noses, no eyes, nothing. Faceless. Seeing my terror, Nina smiled bitterly.\n\u201cYou remember them now because someone asked you. And had you seen their true faces you would be dead. No, I don\u2019t think they want to kill you, unless you refuse to free their brothers.\u201d\n\u201cBut then our clothes\u2014\u201d I began hoarsely.\nShe nodded. Before she could finish, I had my gear on, pack and all. As I was about to step out, I turned.\n\u201cGrazie,\u201d I said, and ran out.\nIt was an hour before twilight. Four miles in an hour is not much for a soldier. But I was burdened by fears I didn\u2019t even know I had. Of all the faces I kept seeing, the most persistent was Angelo\u2019s. I knew he was somehow at the heart of all this, but I still couldn\u2019t figure out how.\nAs I neared the camp, the sun went lower and lower, until it met the horizon. I heard the encampment before I could see it\u2014shouts of command, screams, gunshots. Then my eyes lit upon soldiers running from their tents, bolting out of their holes as if their blankets were on fire. I saw Sgt. Peake\u2019s blanket knotted around his throat like a snake and dragging him off; a black soldier was stabbing his coat in a frenzy; a little guy wearing an officer\u2019s jacket was dancing, arms outstretched, as if the jacket\u2014not him\u2014was leading the dance; a cluster of men, all naked, set a heap of clothes on fire. The clothes\u2014shirts, coats, pants\u2014were writhing as if they were alive, trying to escape from the flames.\nSuddenly a flaming blanket sprung up, engulfing one of the naked men. He screamed horribly, rolling on the ground while two other soldiers tried to extinguish the flames with their hands.\nAnd then I saw them.\nThey were two dozen, maybe more. They were still shadows but forming quickly from the head down, like drops of ink in water, ready to step from the bushes. From the chin down they were dressed like peasant women, with dresses and shawls. But their faces were hidden by petals of purple flesh like closed orchids, quivering, impatient to reveal themselves. As they finally coalesced I heard them. They were murmuring some ancient song, one so old I couldn\u2019t understand all the words. It was a call to their men in the fields: a call home.\nI turned. A single window shone in the distant darkness. And then I heard the Urchins\u2019 far off screams. They weren\u2019t screams of pain like I had thought, but cries of pure yearning.\nThe Nuriae came out into the orchard. Immediately all movement in the camp ceased. I could still hear the soldiers sobbing; many of them were curled up on the ground. There was a big sergeant whose hair was still on fire, quietly smoldering while he stared on, slack-jawed. The washerwomen sang and walked among them like dreams made flesh. Their songs were not for us but that didn\u2019t matter. Transfixed, faces streaked with tears, my mates looked upon them with infinite longing. Some knelt down and began to pray. They prayed for their orchid-faces to open, to reveal themselves. I knew what they felt. They felt that behind the fleshy petals were the faces of their daughters, their lovers, their mothers, calling for them to come back. It was the sirens\u2019 song but in reverse: relinquish the sea and return to Ithaca. I knew, because I felt it too. A slender washerwoman, like a long stemmed flower, passed by me. Jenny? I knew it couldn\u2019t be, but knowing was not enough. What I felt was that if only her petals would open, I could see Jenny\u2019s face one last time. But the petals didn\u2019t open. Instead, the Nuriae stopped. They were all around me, their eyeless faces turned towards the dusk\u2019s blaze. Then\u2014just before twilight gave way to the night\u2014they slowly turned towards me.\nSet them free, they said.\n10\/25\/44\nNo one here remembers last night\u2019s attack. At least they act as if they don\u2019t. Today the guys just cleaned the mess, tended to the wounded and carried on like nothing had happened. Well, not really. The silence in the camp is so thick you could slice it. The soldiers just look haunted. You can see it in their eyes, their souls staring out of them like from some thick-glassed window. When I asked Sgt. Peake for permission to go back to the school, he almost didn\u2019t look at me.\nI know it will happen tonight.\nAt the Madri Pie I was in luck.\nSorella Serena is out of town for some business with the madre superior and will not be back until dawn. Sheely and the correspondents were eager to hear news of the camp; they had heard the shots at night. I told them an ammo box had caught fire and exploded. That\u2019s what was being said back at camp, anyways.\nAs I laid my gear down, I saw Little Angelo bringing in a bucket of water. He just said hello and went upstairs, never meeting my eyes. I wonder what he really knows. Had Sorella Serena told him the Urchins are dangerous? Why? They would never attack another orphan.\nMaybe she lied to Angelo too, so that he would not set them free. And here are my two vital questions: why had Sorella Serena locked the Urchins up? And how is she able to keep them there, during the day? The only thing I am sure of is that it was her, though I still can\u2019t figure out why she has chosen Stephens as their \u201cwarden.\u201d I was an ass not to stay on friendly terms with him. Still, I have to find a way get into the dorm at night.\nI keep on hearing the washerwomen\u2019s song. I wish it would go away. Even more, I wish I could pray to the Urchins for the gift of hope, but I can\u2019t. Hope went away last May, and it won\u2019t ever be returning. I have to sleep now, I need all my stamina for tonight.\n10\/26\/44\nThe night has come and gone and I\u2019m still here. My eyes are full of sleep and visions, but I need to put this all down before I forget.\nYesterday, as soon as I woke up after my early afternoon siesta I began searching for my notebook. Maybe in one of the Teller\u2019s tales there was something that could explain how Sorella Serena trapped the Urchins in the day. But the notebook wasn\u2019t in my pack. I searched for it in the pressroom, but it wasn\u2019t there either. I was thinking I\u2019d have to go back to the Teller\u2019s house when Stephens showed up.\nHe said he knew where my stuff was. My surprise turned to fear when I saw where he was taking me. He opened the door to the dormitory with the key the nun had left him.\nThe twelve wounded were still in the same position, as if I had left them just a few minutes earlier. The room was like I remembered except for the deep scratches by the windowsills. They had all been desperately, viciously, and repeatedly raked over.\nQuietly Stephens walked among the beds.\nHe stopped and leaned over a boy about the same age as Angelo. This Urchin\u2019s head and torso were free of bandages. Again, I looked at the wounds, but this time I considered. These were the marks of this orphan\u2019s death: pox, probably. Then his face, like someone had peeled his skin off from the top of his skull. And\u2014at last\u2014I saw not what was there, but what was not, what had been stolen away.\nJust then, I felt someone nudging at me. Stephens pointed to the bed. The Urchin held an object clutched to his scarred chest.\n\u201cIt is a great honor,\u201d Stephens whispered.\nThe boy held my notebook. In spite of the poor light, I could see that the Urchin was smiling. They all began stirring in unison, muffled giggles beneath their clean bandages. I looked at Stephens, but he shook his head; he had no idea what they were up to. At last I touched the boys\u2019 hands. They were cold and clawed, just like a dead animal\u2019s. Then\u2014just as I retrieved my notebook\u2014the Urchin seized my wrist and spoke. His voice was that of a small child, younger than his real age. What shook me was not the high pitch, but the words. For he said:\n\u201cDaddy, is that you? When are you coming home?\u201d\nI stumbled back and fell to the floor. The dorm was silent, the twelve boys looked like bandaged corpses once again. With an effort I struggled to my feet and stared at Stephens. His face was flushed with what seemed to be surprise and a touch of jealousy. Then I left the dorm, running fast down the stairs.\nStephens found me drinking at the fountain, drying my mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nI lit a cigarette. As I offered it to him I said:\n\u201cThey told you about your piece of land, didn\u2019t they? Why? The way I see it, they can only offer you the unattainable, the impossible.\u201d\nStephens took a long drag, and then in the lowest voice:\n\u201c\u2019Cause I won\u2019t see it. And I won\u2019t marry Barbara, and I won\u2019t build a ranch of my own. I\u2019ve known since my outfit was destroyed. Don\u2019t ask me how I know it, but I do. And they . . . they know it too. So they told me a story, the story of what my life would have been, had I gone back home. It was a good story, and a long one.\u201d\n\u201cToo long.\u201d\nHe shrugged but I could see that he was making his mind up.\n\u201cI think you just might be right,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGood. So, how does she keep them here? In the day, I mean.\u201d\nThere was no need to explain who was \u201cshe\u201d was.\n\u201cI dunno. But she comes by every night to lull them to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cNo morphine then.\u201d\nHe grinned. \u201cYou think command would waste morphine on some foreign kids instead of our own boys?\u201d\n\u201cGood point. Did you ever notice her carrying a bag?\u201d\n\u201cA bag?\u201d\n\u201cOr a sack. Anything really, big enough to hold twelve caps.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no. What caps?\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s how she\u2019s kept them here so far.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you know \u2019bout them?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone back in town.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, you\u2019re good with your people. No offense.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken. I guess they\u2019re my people after all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about us then?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the funny thing: you\u2019re my people too.\u201d\n\u201cMust be hard.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes it is.\u201d\n\u201cSo, why does she keep them here? I mean, the little guys.\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d tell me.\u201d\nHe shook his head slowly.\n\u201cShe is still a mystery to me, that nun. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: she made me swear I\u2019d never let Angelo get near them.\u201d\nYou can\u2019t really prepare yourself for a night like the one I was about to go through, but I had to try. The washerwomen\u2019s song hadn\u2019t left me yet. I knew if I failed, the guys back at the camp would never see dawn again. And they, too, would haunt me for the rest of my days.\nI went looking for Little Angelo and found him under the fig tree, playing sassolini all by himself. As soon as he heard me he stood up, the stones falling to his feet.\n\u201cI know she told you not to speak to me,\u201d I said.\nLittle Angelo did not reply. I could feel a battle raging inside him, pitting his affection for his beloved grandma against his admiration for me, the stranger who told him stories of distant lands. I began by telling him I needed for him to do something that night. If he did this thing, they would be free. Didn\u2019t he want them to be free? Slowly he nodded. I told him what I wanted him to do. He said nothing, just stared at his US army shoes. Then I asked, \u201cDo you know why Grandma doesn\u2019t want you to see them?\u201d\nThe boy stood very still, his face petrified. I couldn\u2019t understand if he didn\u2019t know or if he was too scared to tell me. But I felt I was losing him, that whatever fear held him in its grip, would prevent him from becoming my accomplice. And so, as a last resort I said, \u201cWould you come with me to America?\u201d\nHe looked up. I talked fast. I told him that when the war was over, I would come back to Lucer\u00eca and ask for his adoption. He would become legally my son, we would go to Providence together.\n\u201cWould your wife and son mind?\u201d he said at last.\nThat was a stab to the heart. I didn\u2019t know he knew about Jenny and Junior; probably Sheely had told him. I bit my lip hard. I told him I would write Jenny, but I was sure she\u2019d be more than happy to have him. When he heard this, Angelo got up and danced a little jig. I had to look away. I couldn\u2019t stand to see the green happiness of his eyes.\nStephens found the perfect hide out: a niche in the wall covered by a paper panel. As dusk approached, I looked at the camp with my binoculars. What I saw there made my blood curdle.\nThe washerwomen were already in position at the edge of the orchard. But there weren\u2019t two dozen of them, there were hundreds. \u201cI didn\u2019t know death had undone so many,\u201d I whispered\u2014one of the few lines of Dante\u2019s Commedia my dad had known by heart. How true it was. Their silhouettes were the color of dusk, they flickered like coral flames among the card-playing sergeants, the gossiping corporals, the privates hanging out the laundry\u2014caressing them as they passed by.\nBut the men didn\u2019t see them, they didn\u2019t feel them, they didn\u2019t even know they were there. Then I understood. The washerwomen\u2019s appearance was for me, alone. Should I fail, they would make themselves seen and reveal their true faces to my comrades. It felt like a dream. Yet, I had no choice but to act as if it wasn\u2019t.\nSo I hid and waited.\nI didn\u2019t have to wait for long. As the light in the room changed, I began hearing noises. First yawns, then beds creaking, finally their arms stretching in the air\u2014and they were on their feet. Stephens was already among them, stern faced like a priest at mass.\nThey came to him slowly, warily, their bandages ripped open by clawed fingers. Their faces were the opposite of the Nuriae: bare, vulnerable, and apparently incapable of doing harm. But their eyes, oh their eyes. . . . In the dusk\u2019s blaze they glinted gold. They were the color of those late afternoons of childhood, when days spent in bliss sat on our shoulders without weight, with unbearable lightness.\nThey walked like birds, their heads sunk into their shoulders, their long arms elbowing each other, as if they needed physical contact to remember who they were. As they circled him they whispered, first to each other, then to him. They circled and circled, a merry-go-round of murmurs, the same words echoed by the lipless mouths, with Stephens at their center, his eyes closed, his face a mask of pale rapture. I didn\u2019t hear their words, but suddenly the image of a lake and a meadow sprang up in my mind. I could see it before me as if it were projected on the walls\u2014a Montana ranch and an old man sitting on the front porch, telling stories to his grandson. With a jolt I realized the old man was Stephens, or rather it was he sixty years ahead.\nBlissful, Stephens had a fit of shivers and swooned to the floor. The junkie had had his last fix. In unison, all the Urchins turned to the window, to the setting sun, their eyes burning caramel gold. More than children, they looked like little old men, all staring out at distant dusk with a collective longing. Then they began to jump. The first one sprinted right into the window, just as a bird would. With his weight and speed he should have broken it to shards; but the glass stood, somehow pitching him backward. This drove them crazy.\nA few jumped on the ceiling and crawled upside down to the window. Others clawed madly at the walls, shrieking. Had I known what it would be like, I would never have had the courage to hide there; it was unbearable. They were calling the Night, or rather, the Night was calling through them. If thirst ever became a sound, this would be it. It was not thirst for oblivion, but that unquenchable yearning for freedom unbound, a freedom that knows nothing of death.\nI clawed at my ears until they bled. How long it lasted I do not know, but it seemed like hours. Twilight simply refused to fade away, as if they somehow held it in place. And then, just when I was about to give in and bolt out of the room, the door opened. She still had her traveling clothes on, but in her hands she held her box-harp.\nAs soon as the dwarf-nun\u2019s hands started to play the psaltery, the Urchins quieted down. They crawled back to the floor; circling her, murmuring under their breath. I could hear their pleading, almost a whisper, as they joined their clawed hands.\nThe nun paid them no heed. She didn\u2019t need words to command them; a wave of her music and they slithered back to their beds. They yawned in defeat, returning to their imposed stillness. Somehow she was forcing them to sleep. This was the moment I had been waiting for. The nun stopped when she felt my hands on her shoulders.\n\u201cYou heard them, Sorella. Give them back their caps.\u201d\nWhen she turned I could see the despair in her eyes. But then, with a self-possession I admired, she quietly said:\n\u201cWould you kill me then, soldier? Because I will never tell you where I hid them, not in a thousand years.\u201d\n\u201cYou will tell Angelo. He\u2019s coming here any minute now.\u201d\nDespair flashed in her eyes again. Then, with greater effort:\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. He\u2019s locked safely in his room, like every night.\u201d\nI said nothing but took the key ring from my pocket. The nun stared at me and then at Stephens, still curled on the floor like a baby.\n\u201cTraitor,\u201d she spat; and at that moment someone knocked.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll knock once again,\u201d I said, \u201cthen he\u2019ll come in.\u201d\nThe nun\u2019s face flushed with hatred.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.\n\u201cGive them back and I swear your grandson will stay outside.\u201d\nThe nun hesitated, but when she heard the second knock:\n\u201cI\u2019ll give them back, I swear on the Cross!\u201d\nI walked to the closed door and whispered to it. No one came in. Reluctantly the nun began to take her psaltery to pieces. When she slid off the main soundboard, I saw them: they looked like bishops\u2019 zucchettos, only full of leaves and thorns, as if they had been used as nests. The moment she touched their caps the Urchins stirred. Then, as she offered them, they rose and went to her. The first to touch his cap was the eldest, the one who had spoken to me.\nAs soon as he donned his cap spines grew out of his face; they were white at the tips and brown at the roots, blossoming from his scars. He touched his face in blissful disbelief. He looked like a human thistle, his pockmarks were gone too, and his gold-caramel eyes shone with joyous mischief. Next, the Urchin reared his spiny head and gave a triumphant yap. My heart jumped. It was still thirst made sound: but thirst for wonder and hope and boundless joy.\nIn a rush his companions snatched their red caps from the nun\u2019s hands. A heartbeat, and they were changed. A forest of prickly human chestnuts stared at me, their eyes shining like cats\u2019. Hands on their hips, they crowed in unison\u2014and the window opened at their command. The washerwomen\u2019s song swept in, calling them outside. They heard it too, their eyes wild with yearning for the Night. But before they reached out for it, their leader turned to me and in a sly, sonorous voice said:\n\u201cChill\u2019 che viene dato tuorna sempre, paes\u00e0.\u201d What is given freely always comes back, mate.\nAnd they jumped, out of the window and up into the sky, flying faster than our eyes could follow. It lasted only moments, and then the sun set. Suddenly, it was middle of the night, with no transition. The nun and I looked at each other, shaky and dazed. Wearily, she walked to the door and opened it. Little Angelo rushed in. He looked first at me, then at his grandma, as if he was afraid of some terrible punishment. But Sorella Serena hugged him fiercely, without a word.\nAs soon as I woke up this morning I went to Sheely and told him the twelve orphans were back where they belonged. The war correspondents roared in laughter while the lieutenant looked at me like I was raving mad. They hadn\u2019t a clue what I was talking about.\nThis was the sign that I truly had succeeded. Except for me, only Stephens and Little Angelo\u2014and Sorella Serena of course\u2014remember them; though I feel myself beginning to forget the details. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m really forgetting, it\u2019s more like the night\u2019s happening is softening into something I\u2019ve heard, a story someone told me a long time ago.\nLittle Angelo and I had a long talk. The gist was that what had been a lie yesterday today is the truth. I would bring him to the US, if I survive this war. When I asked his grandma for permission, she just stared at me with a defeated look. I think she understood that in the US, her grandson would have a great deal more opportunities than he would have here. I\u2019ve already spoken with the local commissario and set the paperwork machine in motion. It will take months, but we\u2019re in no hurry. Needless to say, Little Angelo was happy\u2014though this time he didn\u2019t dance. Last night left him strangely somber, like a piece of him flew out from the window with the Urchins, and never came back. I guess he realized his childhood days are coming to a close. He isn\u2019t the only one to feel changed. This is the first time since May that I feel I have something to go back to. Maybe, when all this is over, I will buy a little cottage in Lucer\u00eca and stay over a few years, before heading back to Providence. As I said, there is no hurry. What\u2019s important is the thought I have someone I can go back to once this war is finished. Not a fairy tale, not a memory, but someone real, someone made of flesh and blood.\nI saw Pvt. Stephens as he was being taken to Foggia on the medical aid jeep. As we said goodbye, he grabbed my arm.\n\u201cYou hit the nail on its head,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you guessed they were whispering to me about my land. What about you?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat was Junior\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\u201cYou heard it.\u201d\n\u201cI did, but I think you need to say it anyway, before I go.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI think you do. You said they only offer the impossible. Why?\u201d\nI kept silent for a while. Then I told him that last May, in Providence, my wife and my only son were hit by a truck, and died.\n\u201cBut you\u2019d guessed it already, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cLike I said\u201d\u2014he smiled\u2014\u201cyou needed to say it.\u201d\nHe waved from the jeep till the dust swallowed him.\n10\/28\/44\nSetting off for Anzio. As I am writing this, my outfit is in motion. I know that Anzio means going back to the front lines, but I\u2019ve long since learned: the only way back is the way forward. Sgt. Peake gave me just one hour to say goodbye to Angelo. I must be off now.\n10\/29\/44\nLittle Angelo is dead. I am writing this sentence on paper to convince myself of its truth. Still, I should have known, I should have guessed. How could I have been so blind? I know now that I deserve all the contempt Sorella Sorena has held for me.\nWhen I got to the Madri Pie, there was already quite a crowd in the school orchard. Suor Maria was wailing, hands covering her eyes. Even Sheely and the war correspondents stood in collective pallor. Two small girls were sobbing on a low brick wall. Then a tall, thin man the women called dottore said it had happened exactly like the last time. I still had no idea what they were talking about, until I saw his body.\nIt was outspread right below the second floor balcony, the same one where I\u2019d seen him performing his stunts. I could see that he had his best clothes on, with my shoes. The doctor continually shook his head. Then, just behind him, I saw the dwarf. Her eyes looked like they were carved out of stone. And yet, what truly petrified me was what she held in her hands. It was a red cap, full of leaves and thorns. She held it as if she was holding her own heart. Hadn\u2019t she given all the red caps all back? At last she saw me. She stared at me with eyes of quiet desperation. If she had shouted my guilt, if she had pointed at me and screamed that I had killed her grandson, I could have endured it. But the dwarf-nun was silent. So I turned my back and ran away.\nThe dust from marching feet shields Lucer\u00eca from our sight. I am ever so grateful for it. But as much as I try, I can\u2019t stop seeing the little nun, with the little red cap, clenched in her tiny hands. Will she let them in this time? Will she give them his cap or will she bury it so deep that not even they can unearth it? The thing is, I shall never know. This land will remain a mystery to me, sealed off with all its tales, still baiting me with truths I will never discover. And when\u2014and if\u2014I go home, when I again read these pages, I will read them as a fiction, a tale told by the fire to chase away the hounds of guilt.\nDead of the night. I wake up in my foxhole, like countless other times. I know that in a little while, the sergeant will awaken us all, and that we\u2019ll have to march all day: but still I can\u2019t go back to sleep. All I can see is his dead body in the school orchard. Every tree is a corpse, a forest of the dead. Not just Little Angelo, or Junior, or Jenny, but all the countless companions I\u2019ve seen killed in this blasted war. I try to close my eyes but my eyelids have turned to glass, I am forced to see through them. I open my mouth as if to scream, but the Night chokes me, its darkness pressing down upon my throat like solid ink. And then, just as I am about to be swallowed, Grandma\u2019s lullaby comes back to me.\nI enter quietly and hide under the sofa . . .\nIf I come closer I come into the kitchen . . .\nThen I come in and hide on the hutch,\nbut at night, when I arrive, I stand by your bed.\nA movement up in the clouds. I am not imagining it, I truly see a human shape darting in the sky. It swirls like a swallow above the beech trees, and then lands soundlessly, a single step from my foxhole.\nHis face is a snout, his spines are long and dark green, his hands clawed; but his eyes have the same gentle fire I know. As he crouches over me he gently places his clawed hands on top of my head.\n\u201cDuorme,\u201d Little Angelo says.\nAnd in my dream, I sleep.\nGiovanni De Feo is a fabulist writer in the tradition of Italo Calvino and Dino Buzzati.

Over the last thirty years, dozens of reporters have chased this story\u2014and failed. David insisted, and though the story he sent us is unorthodox, he may have penetrated deeper into the mystery than his predecessors. We present his story as submitted, without modification, and leave it to you to decide how successful he was.\nby David Sargent\nThere are the rumors, of course, which we should (partially) enumerate.\n- David Bowie based his character Ziggy Stardust on Siegfried.\n- Siegfried and Bowie cowrote Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, utilizing a vast secret society of Cold War music lovers that shamed the CIA, the KGB, MI6, and the Stasi, transporting tapes in and out of East Berlin. A corollary hypothesis has it that Bowie and\/or Siegfried were agents for some or all of these agencies.\n- Alien intelligences \u201cbeamed\u201d the entirety of the iconic opus simultaneously into both artists\u2019 heads.\n- Siegfried murdered Bowie and took his place in the glam rock pantheon.\n- Bowie and\/or Siegfried were mind-controlled by the CIA and\/or KGB (or space aliens) using experimental fungal agents. Or they were swapped out with impostors, pod-person replicants, identical yet subtly different.\n- And of course, the most believable, but least interesting: Bowie stole Ziggy flat out, and\/or Siegfried stole it from Bowie.\nThere are always rumors. Conspiracy theories that circulate in obscure underground publications and the weirder reaches of the Internet.\nGiven what is known of Siegfried Sternstaub, none of these seems likely. Given what is not known, all of these are possible.\n1) Siegfried played guitar. This much is undisputed. He may or may not have also played mandolin, accordion, bassoon, or krummhorn, and\/or sung. Reports conflict.\n2) Siegfried lived and performed exclusively in East Berlin.\n3) Siegfried Sternstaub was a stage name. There are many conflicting claimants to that name; it is almost certain that none of them is the real Siegfried Sternstaub.\n4) There are no official recordings of Siegfried\u2019s work. There are literally thousands of Siegfried bootlegs (in the former East Berlin; none exist elsewhere), and new tapes are \u201cdiscovered\u201d every year. There is a small possibility that some of them may actually be genuine. Fans treat them all as canonical.\n5) Siegfried\u2019s first known public performance was 9 November 1969, to an audience of twelve people gathered in a small coffeehouse. His final known performance was exactly twenty years later, on 9 November 1989. The day the Berlin Wall fell.\n* * *\nWho, then, is Siegfried?\nDetermined to discover the truth behind the myth, I traveled to Berlin. I had no agenda, and no itinerary. I didn\u2019t want to be burdened by preconceived notions or external pressures, so I arrived in Berlin with no plan, only an old copy of Ferrari Guides\u2019 Closets Behind the Curtain: Eastern Bloc Tours I\u2019d picked up on eBay. (It was, my editors suggested, almost as if I was running away from something, and grabbed at the first excuse I could find. My carefully crafted response ensured I would have plenty of time to pursue this story.)\nIt really should not have been a surprise that none of the nightclubs and discos listed in the guidebook still existed. It had been a long time since it was published\u2014thirty years\u2014and the streets I walked were a world away from those that Siegfried haunted. Still, it was a disappointment.\nI had to depend on the fans.\nI found one on the bus as I followed the guidebook map toward a location that Ferrari Guides writers called Dresden am Go-Go. His name was, predictably, Hans, and he claimed to be Siegfried\u2019s biggest fan.\n\u201cI am Siegfried\u2019s biggest fan!\u201d he said, patting his prodigious belly. He wore an aqua-colored fishnet shirt under a ratty denim jacket, and brown corduroy bell bottoms. He smelled like bacon gone slightly rancid.\nHe waxed eloquent about Siegfried\u2019s inimitable picking technique, which he attributed to Siegfried having two thumbs on each hand.\n\u201cTwo picks the Siegfried is using,\u201d he said. \u201cListen carefully. You will hear.\u201d\nMy stop neared. I told Hans of my destination, and he laughed, and wished me luck. He scratched his address on one of the pages of the guide with a leaky ballpoint pen.\n\u201cLater,\u201d he said, \u201cyou want to learn of the Siegfried, you come. I teach you.\u201d\nI got off the bus and walked the three blocks to Dresden am Go-Go. It wasn\u2019t there, of course, but I thought I might glean something by talking to the people who had taken over the building.\nThere was no building there that could ever have been a discotheque. Just a police station that had stood there since the fifties. I asked some people on the street about the disco, but they all shrugged their shoulders. They had never heard of it. Neither had the police. A policewoman saw the guidebook under my arm. She shook her head and pursed her lips.\n\u201cThis propaganda,\u201d she said, with a curt wag of her finger. \u201cNicht gut. Dangerous.\u201d\nFerrari Guides publishes queer-friendly travel guides, with a reputation for dependability. I was beginning to get the feeling that in this case, they hadn\u2019t actually gotten a writer across the Iron Curtain before going to press and had just pulled the whole thing out of their ass. Which seemed unlikely. The other alternative seemed even less likely: the book was a fake created specifically to misguide people looking into Siegfried Sternstaub.\nAfter visiting three other locations that day with similar results, I determined that whatever the cause, the guide was worse than useless, and went back to my hotel.\n* * *\nSubject #1: Hans V.\nGerman male, age 57.\nHans V. is a vaguely employed Spanferkelmeister and, as stated previously, Siegfried\u2019s self-proclaimed biggest fan. He maintains a collection of over one thousand alleged bootleg recordings.\nI had no surname or phone number, only the address scribbled in my guidebook, which led me to a massive apartment block, uniformly gray and oppressive in the manner of seventies-era communist architecture. Compared to the United States, Germany is clean and pristine. There are always exceptions.\nI found the apartment without trouble, but the buzzer didn\u2019t work\u2014the panel was broken open and all the copper wiring stripped out. The lock on the front door was also broken, as was the lift, so I walked up seven flights of stairs and rapped on the door.\nHans answered in his underwear.\n\u201cAh, Herr Reporter!\u201d he cried, engulfing me in his massive arms like I was a long-lost friend. Or a puppy. \u201cI did not expect you until tomorrow. Ist gut my package arrive also early, ja?\u201d\nHe ushered me into his apartment, an efficiency with a minimal kitchen and a stained mattress on the floor. Seventies-era shag carpeting matched the avocado-green refrigerator. He used cardboard boxes stacked five high and three wide as his wardrobe.\nHans\u2019s stereo system stood in stark contrast to the shabbiness of his apartment. Sound Lab panel speakers and a REL subwoofer, driven by a Leben tube amp. A wall of LP records. Crates of cassettes.\nHans picked an opened package off his bed and handed it to me, reverently. \u201cMy newest treasure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will listen to it together for the first time.\u201d\nInside was a cassette tape, a TDK SM-X, well used. This is the pinnacle of high-fidelity cassettes, beloved of recording musicians around the world, and normally would bode well. But something had been written on it, and then covered with Wite-Out. \u201cFleetwood Mac\u2014Rumours\u201d was written atop that, and then scribbled out with purple ink. A small sticker of a winged unicorn\u2014a pegahorn, one of my ex-girlfriends called them\u2014graced one corner.\nI was, understandably, disappointed. Still, I had come this far.\nHans patted the pillow on his mattress. \u201cLie here,\u201d he ordered. \u201cIs the best place for the Siegfried to be listening.\u201d\nWith all the formality and gravitas of a religious ceremony, Hans tightened up the spools with a pen and inserted the tape into the cassette deck (a Nakamichi Dragon). He pressed play and settled into the bed next to me.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I started to ask something.\nHe shushed me like a seasoned librarian.\nThere was the faintest hiss, and then the music began.\nHoward Jones, \u201cNo One Is to Blame.\u201d\nNot only was it distinctly not Siegfried Sternstaub, it was a hideous recording, full of hiss and distortion. Whatever machine had been used to make the recording had done an incomplete job of erasing the earlier contents, and I could hear Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cSecond Hand News\u201d ghosting behind Jones\u2019s new wave crooning. And there were other, earlier sounds, guitars heavy with distortion, and something that sounded like a harpsichord.\nHans had his eyes closed, beatific smile on his face. His foot tapped out of time with the music. He grasped my hand, thick fingers twined with mine; his other hand danced like an orchestra conductor\u2019s.\nWhen the tape was done, and Hans finally released me, I escaped the bed with as much grace as I could manage.\n\u201cHimmlisch,\u201d Hans sighed. \u201cSublime. Ah, I wish there was more time to share with you the other side, but I must go for a pig to slaughter.\u201d\nI thanked Hans for his time, and fled.\n* * *\nPerhaps I started this story in the wrong place. It may have nothing to do with Siegfried Sternstaub, after all. Perhaps the story begins on 9 November 1969, when a young David Sargent crawls howling into the world. Or 9 November 1989, when a hardly less young David Sargent, oblivious to the momentous events taking place in Berlin, stands at a Las Vegas altar before an Elvis-impersonating minister and solemnly swears eternity to the love of his life.\nOr maybe the beginning comes later, when a perverse court system chooses 9 November 2012 to finalize the divorce, and young David realizes that at the wizened age of forty-three, his crowning achievement is writing reviews of bad pop albums, buried in the advertisements cluttering the back of a once-relevant music magazine.\nHow does one separate the writer from the written? The written from the written-about? This is the game journalists play. After all, what does my divorce have to do with Siegfried Sternstaub? In what way is our last, brutal argument relevant to East German glam rock?\nOr should we, like Hunter S. Thompson, throw away the distinction between the story and the storyteller? Become part of the history we describe? Another kind of game. A gamble. A Spiel.\nI was forty-three. It was time to make a name for myself. What better way than to tilt quixotic against the unwritable story?\nBut why this particular unwritable story? Why Siegfried Sternstaub?\nWe shared a birthday.\n* * *\nIn Berlin, all the synchronicities disappeared. The fans were even less reliable than the guidebook. For the first time I began to worry. Coming here really was a gamble. I had taken a leave of absence to pursue this story, possibly a permanent one. The only way my noninsignificant expenses\u2014airfare, Gasthaus, meals\u2014could be recouped was if I could produce a salable story. I was beginning to suspect that not only was there no salable story here, there was no story at all.\nWas it possible that the entire concept of Siegfried Sternstaub was an elaborate hoax? That Siegfried did not and had never existed? That he was the product of a depressed, postcommunist economy searching for something\u2014anything\u2014to hold up as uniquely their own? And the West\u2019s fascination with the myth little more than neo-romantic nostalgia for a less complicated age?\nIn homage to the hedonistic extremism of the seventies, I decided to become thoroughly, extravagantly drunk. I started at the hotel bar with a martini. Then I moved to the bar across the street for a chocolatey stout. I\u2019m not entirely sure where I went from there, or how many stops there were. I only know that at some point I staggered into the most dilapidated disco I\u2019d ever seen. Bee Gees blared from a scratchy sound system, and under a tarnished disco ball, a handful of pudgy, middle-aged people did their best Saturday Night Fever moves.\nI staggered to the bar and ordered something. I have no idea what. I remember three glasses simultaneously poured in front of me, and I missed the first time I tried to grab one of them.\nThere was a woman there, watching me. She was about my age, which is to say, somewhat beyond our mutual primes. One moment she was at the far end of the bar. The next, she was sitting on the stool next to me, cool hand on mine, preventing me from lifting the glass now that I had finally found it.\n\u201cIf you drink that,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will pass out.\u201d\n* * *\nSubject #2: Jutte H.\nGerman female, age 40.\nJutte H. is evasive about her career, saying only that if it was discovered that she was a Siegfried fan, it would adversely affect her employment. She claims that she was in the audience at Siegfried\u2019s farewell concert.\n\u201cIt was my first time,\u201d she said, smiling like she\u2019d had a backstage pass.\nI have no way to verify this claim, nor can I do more than postulate what she meant.\nI did not know, when we first met, that she was familiar with Siegfried Sternstaub. I simply wanted to get (more) drunk, and she had interposed herself.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the goal,\u201d I said. Or tried to say. Later, she told me I\u2019d said spiel instead of ziel. That\u2019s the game. Or perhaps, that\u2019s the gamble.\nApropos, if unintentional.\n\u201cI have something to keep you awake,\u201d she said. She took my hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nWe ended up, first, in the ladies\u2019 WC, snorting lines of cocaine off her compact mirror. Later, I found myself repeating the ritual off her bare belly, on her living room floor. Somewhere in between that, I have vague memories of dancing (I am not a dancer) and frantic, clumsy kisses in the back of a taxi.\nI remember that the sky was starting to go gray when the taxi let us off. She shushed me in the foyer, pulling at my clothes before we had even gotten the door closed. There was more cocaine, and I remember watching her curves as she crawled across the hardwood floor to get something off a table.\nShe came back with an iPod, and dual earphones. She handed me a pair and fiddled with the device.\n\u201cMy favorite musician,\u201d she said, and pressed play.\nThe strains of Debussy\u2019s La Mer came through the earphones, washing over the staccato growl of the Clash\u2019s \u201cLondon Calling.\u201d Underlying all that was a subtle cacophony of sounds\u2014hints of accordion polkas, fragments of Coltrane. Someone screaming in Japanese.\n\u201cSiegfried Sternstaub,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh, you know him!\u201d she said, climbing onto my lap and pushing me prone. \u201cIsn\u2019t he wonderful?\u201d\nI\u2019m not entirely positive, but I don\u2019t think we actually had sex. I remember her body moving in time to a music that I did not hear, her breath on my throat, her teeth on my nipple. I remember a large pair of feet on either side of my head, blue striped pajamas rising up to a pair of muscled and tattooed arms crossed over a massive chest, occluding the man\u2019s face.\nI scrabbled at the earphones in our ears. Jutte looked up at the man, then sat up, frowning.\n\u201cThe children will be awake soon,\u201d he said.\nI was not killed. Neither was I permitted to leave. Jutte brought out sheets and a pillow and settled me on the couch, and then followed her husband to bed. Before she did, she slipped the earbuds back in my ears and set the iPod on repeat.\n\u201cListen to Siegfried,\u201d she said, her breath hot on my lips, her fingernails raising flesh in long, red stripes across my chest, \u201cand think of me.\u201d\nI did.\n* * *\nWhen I was in college I could have weathered a night like that with only one lost day; at my age, it took two days to stop wanting to die, and another to start feeling vaguely human.\nJutte seemed slightly embarrassed by the whole thing, but I caught her smiling when she saw the marks she\u2019d left on my body.\nI was too hung over to take pleasure in that.\nWe talked\u2014painfully\u2014of Siegfried. She did not seem surprised to find out that I was working on a story. She was surprised when I told her that my first impression of what was being touted as Siegfried\u2019s music was that it was simply someone mashing a bunch of different existing music together on a tape.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? That was Siegfried\u2019s most famous concert, recorded at Raumschiff Steigen in 1972.\u201d Spaceship Rising. Another club that had never existed, except in the imaginations of renegade guidebook writers and conspiracy nuts.\nShe hummed a bit of a tune. It sounded familiar, though I didn\u2019t remember hearing it on the recording. She sang a few bars.\nBegleitet von dem Glanz der Sterne\ndie Zukunft winkt in weiter Ferne\nYes. Yes, I knew that. I\u2019d heard it, somewhere.\nI scribbled down the lines, and the next line as well, which I felt I knew. Und leise folgen wir. \u201cAnd quietly we follow.\u201d Jutte glanced at the paper and nodded.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are starting to understand.\u201d\nTwo days later, when I could stand the glare of a computer screen, I searched for those lines on the Internet. Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and Dogpile: none of them found any hits.\nMaybe I had heard it only in my dreams.\n* * *\nThe other thing that I was unable to find was evidence of any publication by Ferrari Guides of a guidebook of communist East Europe. Google provided no hits, and eBay didn\u2019t even have a record of my own purchase. A Library of Congress search on the ISBN pointed to an out-of-print book about garden gnome collecting.\nI managed to get someone from Ferrari Guides on the phone. He flatly denied that they had ever produced such a book, and warned that I shouldn\u2019t trust anything I read in it. The best thing, he said, was to throw it away, or better yet, forward it to their legal department.\nThe book was a clue, I felt, or a collection of clues. A codex, perhaps. If I could discover the key to interpreting it, the mystery of Siegfried Sternstaub would open before me like a certain German Fraulein\u2014or Frau, as it turns out.\nJutte was the key, I felt. I needed to find her, and seduce her into taking me further into her mysteries.\nBut first, if I was to seduce anything out of anyone, I needed to bathe.\nI found myself whistling cheerfully in the shower, smiling as I realized that it was a Siegfried song. I closed my eyes and remembered Jutte\u2019s body, moving in time with the music. . . .\nBut that was wrong. It was a different time signature. A different rhythm. The song in my head matched another movement entirely: Hans\u2019s conductor-hand, waving in the air.\n* * *\nIt is interesting to note that the rumors linking David Bowie and Siegfried Sternstaub exist only in what had until 1989 been called \u201cthe Western World,\u201d where no factual knowledge of Siegfried exists. In the section of the city that had been known as East Berlin, such concepts are dismissed.\nJutte had said as much, the afternoon after our aborted tryst. \u201cI don\u2019t see how anyone could think such a thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey sound nothing alike.\u201d\nI had wanted to follow up on this, now that I was no longer hung over, but her husband answered the door. He stared at me while I summoned up the nerve to ask for Jutte. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, he held up his hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve done enough damage?\u201d he asked.\nI would need to find a different source.\n* * *\nSubject #3: Karl D.\nGerman male, age 25.\nKarl D. works illegally as a prostitute. Prostitution is legal in Germany, and is heavily regulated. Karl, an anarchist, refuses to acknowledge the government\u2019s authority over his use of his body, or over anything else. I found him, late at night, scrawling massive genitals in red and purple Edding markers on the iconic figures in the stained glass windows of the church that stands where the ersatz guidebook claimed a counterculture music hall stood.\nIt was growing increasingly likely that the Siegfried story was unwritable. Perhaps, I thought, I could salvage the trip by doing a piece on Berliner graffiti artists. Perhaps I was witnessing the budding art of a fledgling Banksy.\nHe completed one particularly prodigious member, stretching from the baby in the middle of the central panel to the edge, then circumnavigating the frame before jumping to other panels, and finally running completely off the edge of the window. Finished, the artist descended toward the street.\nI needed to talk to this man, so I ran from the shadows of the building I\u2019d been watching from, across the street, hoping I\u2019d get there in time to prevent him from running off.\nHe surprised me by dropping the last few meters. He turned as he straightened and flicked a lighter in my face, blinding me.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cPolizei?\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re the American.\u201d The flame disappeared, and I was blinded again in the sudden darkness. \u201cYou like my work?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t lie.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be art,\u201d he said. \u201cI merely repair faulty religious imagery.\u201d\n\u201cRepair?\u201d\n\u201cIf God is perfect and infinite\u2014and I\u2019m not saying He exists, but if He does, He\u2019s perfect and infinite\u2014then all of His attributes must be perfect and infinite. Jesus\u2019s penis is . . . must be. . . .\u201d He gestured, shrugged. \u201cBig enough to impregnate the whole world. My name is Karl.\u201d\nLights flashed. A siren wailed.\n\u201cWe should go,\u201d Karl suggested.\nWe ran. I could not reproduce the maze of alleys and courtyards we traversed, the walls and fences we scaled. He outpaced me easily.\nI was gasping when I caught up to him. He had the door of an antiquated car open, and gestured me inside. It took a few tries to get it started, and when it did, it puttered spastically, like a lawnmower on speed. He patted the dashboard affectionately, and then we were off, a mad dash through narrow streets, ignoring streetlights and jumping curbs without warning.\nHe drove like no German I have ever seen. I said as much.\n\u201cDrove a taxi in Manhattan for two years,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I was going to NYU. I studied political philosophy for four years, but all my real learning came behind the wheel. Everything you need to know about power relations plays out every day on every street, if you know how to see. Now that I\u2019m a whore it\u2019s easier\u2014all the power relations are negotiated up front.\u201d\nAs we drove, he told me all about the car, a 1958 Trabant P50, gesticulating dramatically with both hands. \u201cThis is the best car ever built,\u201d he said. \u201cNo rust, ever. You know why? Built out of paper.\u201d He had quite a few things to say about Henry Ford. None of them good. I just nodded and tried not to imagine what would happen to a paper chassis if it ran head-on into a Mercedes. Or even a bicycle.\nEventually, the car bumped up onto the sidewalk and screeched to a halt. Karl led me up the fire escape of an abandoned industrial building and into an apartment nestled discretely within.\nWe settled into a well-stocked, if haphazard, library. Shelves covered all four walls, leaving space only for the doors and a fireplace. Most of the books were in German, of course, but also English, French, Latin, and Greek. Some Cyrillic texts, as well. I recognized Marx, Foucault, and Ballard. Lenin, Heinlein, and Dworkin shared a shelf with Derrida and VanderMeer. I was unable to discern any sort of system.\nKarl tossed me a warm beer and flopped onto one of the threadbare overstuffed chairs.\n\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Siegfried\u2019s music is about fucking. Not the lyrics, of course. He sings about drugs and sound experiments and alternate realities and space aliens and intelligent mushrooms and . . . well, you know all that, of course. But you can only go so far in your understanding through intellectual analysis. To understand the phenomenon that is Siegfried Sternstaub ultimately requires giving one\u2019s body to the endeavor.\u201d\nThe beer was horrible. It probably predated the car. Instinctually, I spat it out.\n\u201cDon\u2019t drink that,\u201d Karl said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably poison. Come, I want to show you something.\u201d\nThe next room Karl took me to was the monstrous bargain-basement alternative to Hans\u2019s magnificent sound system. Where Hans had optimized for purity of sound, Karl had gone for power. There were amplifiers stacked around the room, dozens of them. Stereo amps with speakers, guitar amps, bass amps, PA systems\u2014anything that made sound. All tied together with a fabulously unsafe tangle of cables.\n\u201cSo, this is the room of Siegfried?\u201d I said. \u201cBlast the music loud enough and everything becomes clear? It\u2019s that simple?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I told you, Siegfried\u2019s music is about fucking.\u201d\n\u201cI see. But I\u2019m not gay.\u201d\nKarl shrugged. \u201cNeither am I. I only have sex with men for money.\u201d\nIt was a particularly stupid position to find oneself in. I had dedicated quite a bit of time and effort, had gambled everything, to discover that which was Siegfried Sternstaub. So far I had nothing worth writing about. Or at least, nothing worthy of getting paid for.\nI had a distinct feeling that there was some sort of Siegfried fan network, that everything I had done so far had been communicated through the network, and what I did now determined what sort of access I would have in the future.\nIf I balked now, all the doors would shut, and I might as well book the next flight home.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n* * *\nSo what can I tell you about sex with Karl? What am I willing to tell?\nWell, first off, it was not quite so straightforward as simply saying yes. There was the fee to negotiate.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Karl said. \u201cSex is labor, and labor must be valued.\u201d\nThe exact amount, on the other hand, was variable. Karl produced nine dice and asked me to pick three. He would roll six dice to determine the cost of services, and I would roll my three to determine my discount. Whatever the result, that\u2019s how many hundreds of euros it would cost me.\n\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d I said. \u201cDepending on the roll, you could end up paying your customer.\u201d\n\u201cYes. It plays games with the power relations when that happens, in very interesting ways.\u201d\nThis was not one of those times.\nKarl laid me on my back and put a pillow under my hips. He lifted my legs to his shoulders, and then got to work.\nWhat do I want to say about this? It was painful, and vaguely unpleasant. I made the mistake of looking at Karl\u2019s face once. He looked very determined. After that, I closed my eyes, or looked at the ceiling, or the walls.\nIt was also quite loud. Karl gave me earplugs. The noise was so intense that even with the protection, it was painful. More like being in the middle of a blacksmithing competition than listening to music; the vibration set everything moving. Even the rug on the floor danced in time.\nIt went on forever.\nThe sensation had gone from vaguely unpleasant to mildly pleasurable, and then back to pain. I closed my eyes and hoped it would be over soon.\nThe revelation hit me then: this had been a mistake. All of it. Karl. The trip. Quitting my job. Quitting my marriage.\nA shadow passed over me. A woman, wearing loose cotton pants and no shirt. She was not German, ethnically\u2014brown skin and long, dark hair. She had a pierced belly button.\nI didn\u2019t try to say anything; there was no way to be heard over the noise, even without the earplugs.\nShe studied my face intently as Karl labored. Then she opened a sketch pad and drew. Fast. Just a few lines of charcoal, some shading. Then she turned the page, observed, and drew again.\n* * *\nI have become convinced that all the Bowie speculation is a purely Western phenomenon (or a \u201cWestern Episteme-Colonial meme,\u201d as Karl suggests), and outside of the mimetic cultural constructs, no (f)actual link between the two artists exists.\n* * *\nSubject #4: Nisa F.\nTurkish female, age 29.\nNisa F. is an artist who makes her living restoring defaced religious artworks. Her own work, she says, is personal, and transitory.\nI found her in the library after I finished my shower. She had gotten a fire going in the fireplace. It crackled cheerfully. Nisa was dressed as she was earlier. I was wearing Karl\u2019s robe, still drying my hair with a towel.\nShe sat on the floor by the fire, flipping through her sketch pad. When she saw me, she set it aside and patted the floor next to her.\n\u201cKarl has gone to bed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind.\u201d\nI shook my head. At that moment, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to ever see Karl again. I felt like I had been used, and had paid a thousand euros for the privilege. The thought of it filled me with shame, and this woman had witnessed my humiliation.\n\u201cDo you like the fire?\u201d Nisa asked. \u201cShh, don\u2019t answer yet. Look at it. Observe, but without thinking.\u201d\nWe watched the fire. Nisa leaned her head against my shoulder.\nIt was nice.\n\u201cThe fire is the tree letting go,\u201d Nisa said. \u201cIt was a seed. It grew. It fell. But through it all, it remembered that it was a tree. But the fire? The fire is the dance the tree makes when it realizes it no longer needs to be a tree.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s being destroyed.\u201d\nNisa picked up her sketch pad, opened it in her lap. It was a drawing of me, jaw clenched, lips pressed tight, eyes slitted. She had captured all this, all my hurt and confusion and despair, in maybe a dozen lines. It was all there\u2014the divorce, my career, my desperation. It was, in its own way, perfect. It hurt just to look at it.\n\u201cThis is you, holding everything in. Static. Unchanging.\u201d\nShe ripped the page out of the book and threw it into the fire. It fluttered, curled, burst into flames.\n\u201cThat is one moment in time. Now it is gone.\u201d\nThe next drawing was of my face, watching her work. Watching the concentration wrinkling her brow. I could feel the battering that Karl and the Siegfried noise were subjecting my body to fade\u2014not in intensity, but in importance.\n\u201cThis is you starting to let go of your pain. It is a different person looking into my eyes. He makes me want to smile.\u201d\nAs the second drawing danced in the flames, I remembered that smile. It had touched me in a way all of Karl\u2019s ministrations had failed, and the next drawing showed as much, my mouth open in surprise, neck arched and tense, eyes fluttered shut.\n\u201cThis is you letting go of your fear,\u201d Nisa said.\nThe drawing went into the fire.\nThe next drawing was, again, my face, lines smooth, relaxed.\n\u201cThis is you, letting go.\u201d\nThe fire took that one, too, and Nisa and I spoke more intimately in the warmth of its passing, long into the night.\n* * *\nSubject #5: David S.\nAmerican male, age 43.\nDavid S. is a freelance journalist on temporary assignment in Berlin. He has spent the last several weeks ferreting out the secrets of an obscure local music icon, and is still not sure if he has a salable story.\nBut just in case I do, I\u2019ve spent the last week holed up in a library in an abandoned factory, trying to get my notes consolidated into something that vaguely resembles a narrative. I couldn\u2019t afford to stay at the hotel after Karl fucked me out of a thousand euros. I miss the bar, but the fire here is warm.\nAnd Karl was at least gentleman enough to steal a printer so I could print up what I\u2019d written. I haven\u2019t had Internet access since moving into the library.\nThe last bit of this article is handwritten, because I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to end. I understood in theory: Siegfried\u2019s music is about alternates and alternatives. Worlds that exist like sheets of paper in a book, or a sketch pad. As much as one might feel compelled to hang on to one page, one version of things, the only way to get beyond it is to let it go.\nAll things are possible, but only one at a time.\nOr perhaps, only one per perspective.\nThis, today, now: this is the test.\nI\u2019m sitting on a bench outside a police station\u2014the very station where I started my quest. I can see two doors, superimposed. One, a dour, gray door that leads to a series of dour rooms full of dour police officers filling out endless paperwork. The other, gold and glass and chrome, under a marquee of flashing lights.\nThere\u2019s a mailbox across the street. Once I sign off, this packet will go flying across the globe to a very different city, also full of dour, unimaginative offices and once-relevant music magazines. I will not be following it.\nBehind one door, the susurrus of shuffling papers. Behind the other, I hear the opening strains of Siegfried Sternstaub\u2019s iconic opus.\nSiegfried played guitar, and he\u2019s playing now. I can hear the distinctive double-pick technique. It\u2019s unmistakable.\nIt\u2019s my choice. All I need to do is let go.\nAccompanied by the glory of the stars\nthe future beckons in the distance\nand quietly we follow.\nBest regards,\nDavid Sargent\nP.S.

Stooped stone homes hunker against the ghost of a blood-moon visible through the roiling crimson storm above. If the dark lords wished, they might hide those brooding clouds with a simulacrum of the skies of old, but instead they choose to keep them red and raw, a reminder of the sixty-years-old Harrowing that brought them dominion.\nDespite her age she marches straight and proud\u2014as an Inquisitor should\u2014and her uniform is impeccable. Her old knees and hips, worn through years of training and dedicated service, stab arthritic needles with every step.\nIt\u2019s a penance, she reminds herself. Let every ache and pain be a life destroyed, and still I won\u2019t have made amends by the time I kill a dark lord.\nThe dark lords\u2019 redoubt claws at the sky ahead of her, a pillar of distorted minarets and black stone geometry in the centre of the city. Some of the buildings damaged by its arrival decades ago still cower unrestored in its shadow; the redoubt had burst through streets and buildings to impose its will upon the world.\nAt seventy she is no longer on active duty, but an Inquisitor\u2019s role is for life and the dark lords\u2019 high guard straightens to attention when she steps into sight across the cobblestone plaza. She strives to drive any expression from her face as she approaches, relies on her training to dampen the bone-deep ache of every step that brings her closer.\n\u201cI wish to see Dark Lord Rokogogh,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a matter regarding the old forests.\u201d Rokogogh prides himself on having defined the equations that brought down the Elf nation.\nIf she can only see him she\u2019d need mere seconds to push her worn body into one final solution of sword and dagger and angle thrusts, an avenging storm for the trees.\n* * *\nYoung Aishling stood with twenty of her fellows at the foothills to the Great Elven Forests, now the Great Ash Wastes. They were all earnest, devoted children of the New Order.\nBlack stumps like broken fangs spread ahead for countless miles over the rolling hills, out to the faint flicker of silver in the distance. The northern sea had never been visible from this place before, not with a thousand centuries of ancient oaks crowding between. The dark lords had only to bring a thousand years of enmity to bear to reduce all those ages to ash.\n\u201cChildren of the New Order!\u201d the Cult-Sergeant barked at them. He was a Man in his thirties, his bladed plate cuirass strapped almost casually on his shoulders. The Harrowing was over, but the trappings of war lingered on. Aishling was only ten, but she could read and count, and she counted golden leaves aplenty on the Sergeant\u2019s chest. That meant he\u2019d personally killed many Elves in hand-to-hand combat. Elves had been fast, brutal things, all biting thorns and sharp blades and hailing stones and arrows; the Cult-Sergeant was clearly a formidable opponent.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Forest Wardens now! You will come here every day to tend the trees.\u201d He took a step backward, leaving deep boot prints in the ash and charcoal. He pointed a black iron gauntlet finger at something near his feet, something tiny and pale green poking through the black.\n\u201cThese new shoots are all that remains of the Golden Oaks of the Variegated Hegemony of Elfkind. Every morning Forest Wardens like yourselves will patrol their territories and will dig up the saplings. You will take your salt-horns and salt the holes from which you dig them. You will burn them root and seed all, at the end of each day.\u201d He crouched down and dug in the black ash at the base of the oak shoot, pulled the tiny green thing free, and threw it onto a pile of rubbish.\n\u201cAishling is your foreman; you will obey her or you will be whipped. Away!\u201d The Sergeant stepped aside with a wide expansive movement. His arm\u2019s sweep took in the vast ashlands and the roiling red clouds on the horizon. Farther to the west, in the centre of the scorched earth, Aishling could make out the lines and shapes of two towering dark lord constructs, Eschatons; they were nothing more than tattered hide and sailcloth and bone and needle legs, twisted, towering spiders. The Eschatons stalked through the ash-stumps, hunting for bones and valuable metals for their masters, unfolding matter at their whim. They were lifeless conduits for dark lord geometry.\nAishling took a deep breath to project her words.\n\u201cMove out, Wardens!\u201d She yelled it in her high child\u2019s voice.\nThey spread out into the ash, groups of two each with a water bladder, a horn full of salt, and a hessian bag to collect the regrowth. Aishling made sure they were all within hearing distance and began her own earnest search for green.\nTheir square of old forest adjoined old Elf nation ceremonial gates, now driven to dust by the dark lords\u2019 balefire. All that remained of the grand entwined-tree archway were the snapped stumps of their bases. Aishling found several newly sprouting gold oaks and dug them up, salted the holes. Her bag filled slowly. How many Golden Oak acorns were buried in this vast dead forest? Would they ever stop trying to grow back?\nNear one of the sprouts Aishling found an Elf helm, scorched black but otherwise pristine where she thumbed a bright smear across its forehead. The Harrowing took most of the Elves by surprise; as news reached them of the advance of dark lord armies on the Dwarf mine-forts, they did not expect an assault from within their homeland. Through vortices spun by the living roots of trees that had betrayed their makers, dark lord Rokogogh marched into the heart of the Variegated Hegemony with his ensorcers and laid the Calymmian Curse. That wave of power cut the heart out of the Elves, and they, too, fell and burned. It was the final curse of the war. Nothing stood now but mankind and its dark lord masters.\nAishling placed the helm carefully at her feet and spotted a breastplate amidst the charcoal. She wiped it partly clear with the edge of her bag and saw more silver, something the Eschatons would undoubtedly salvage given a chance. Each half of the breastplate had been embossed with the most amazing tree she could imagine, fat at the base, slender and holy at the crown. Delicate leaves cascaded in the steel, seeming alive and merely frozen in the moment. The black ash served to bring out the relief in exquisite detail. These were the graven images of the trees she and her wardens were ending.\nAishling delighted in the dead artistry a little longer, then left the breastplate and returned to digging for trees.\nOn the evening of the third day the Cult-Sergeant rode by and told her they would be tending a different square mile of ash in the morning. With the moon\u2019s light filtered red through the roiling clouds above, Aishling returned to the remains of the ceremonial gates and took the helm and the breastplate with her to their new grounds.\nShe placed them upright against a blackened stump, and when Esmeralda, Torko, and Sora arrived early for the day\u2019s work, she showed it to them.\n\u201cSee, this is what the trees looked like,\u201d Aishling said. She tried to keep the awe and fear out of her voice.\nTorko ran a finger over the embossed leaves. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cI see why the dark lords wanted to kill them all.\u201d\nAishling didn\u2019t say a thing as each of them touched her discovery. Sora put the helmet on her head.\n\u201cThey had funny-shaped heads,\u201d she said, laughing.\nEsmeralda\u2019s cheeks and hands were marred by fine scars, and she merely placed her palms flat on the armour\u2019s surface, contemplative.\nThey found only four young oak sprouts that day, and burned them all.\nBut Aishling found an acorn too. She didn\u2019t know why she put it in a pocket, but over the next few months she collected at least fifty acorns, hiding them in her bunk. When, three years later, no more tree sprouts could be found and the Forest Wardens were disbanded, she gave each of her original Wardens a seed as a reminder and kept the rest for herself.\n* * *\nAishling waits, rolling her very last acorn back and forth in her tightly clenched hand, ignoring the silent guards and the arthritic pain deep in her knuckles.\nThe portcullis groans into movement and rises. The dark lord guards pivot smartly, opening a path directly toward the small wicket door opening in the vast wooden gates.\nInquisitor Lachrim steps through. Aishling instinctively stuffs the seed back into her pocket as he approaches.\n\u201cInquisitor Aishling. Dark Lord Rokogogh is not in attendance. Dark Lord Tanatloch will see you in his stead.\u201d Lachrim has a subtle contempt for his elders, carried in the angle of his head; he stares too long, stands too casually. Aishling had trained the Inquisitor who\u2019d trained Lachrim. It seems this is a generation too distant to earn his respect.\nAnd Dark Lord Tanatloch? He tortured her nearly four decades ago. It will be fitting if she scratches his ageless demeanour with her last breath.\nLachrim raises an eyebrow, waiting for a response.\nAishling clears her throat. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll see him now.\u201d\n* * *\nThey surrounded the building quietly. It was an uninviting structure, no more than an abandoned stone hall, but Childfinder Aishling trusted her sources. Twelve hand-chosen shock troops waited in the shadows; a ragged Eschaton towered in the distance, channelling dark lord geometry through its spidery limbs. It waited in the town square, seemingly on regular patrol, but had been seconded to her and was ready to peel aside the walls at her command.\n\u201cMistress!\u201d Abramelech was a good man but tinged with inexperience. Aishling flicked her gaze in his direction.\n\u201cMistress, these old buildings could collapse if the Eschaton tries to unfold it. The children . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cI have factored in the probabilities, sergeant.\u201d Her words were terse and she twisted her arm to show him the black geometrics tattooed on the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve studied dark lord mathematics for many years. Their faith in me is projected on my skin.\u201d\nAishling turned back to the waiting doors. There was no sound from the building, but deep below an illegal school met monthly, when the blood-moon was new and the night sky looked almost normal.\nAishling held up a hand to keep the troops in place, advanced slowly to the doors, and marked unfolding wards. Primed, the distant Eschaton wavered slightly on its thin legs. The troops couldn\u2019t notice, but Aishling felt the back of her hands crawling, and then the doors slid impossibly sideways and inward, absorbed into the stone walls. Aishling kept her hand high and stepped forward, past warped hinges and twisted wood-stone edges.\nThe hall was some sort of workshop; half of the floor space was taken up by long rows of tables, and shelves of hammers and other tools lined the walls.\nA cold iron furnace dominated the far wall. Their informants said there was a trapdoor somewhere near that furnace, hidden beneath an old rug.\nShe advanced on the furnace, spotted the rug, and pulled it aside to see the reported hatch. This close, she heard muffled chanting\u2014a singsong mnemonic\u2014and the voices of children. She didn\u2019t hate children, but the kind of unauthorised education perpetrated by illegal teachers threatened dark lord rule.\nAishling opened the trapdoor and slowly descended the wooden ladder beneath, quietly as she could. She wore no noisy metal armour to betray her approach because she didn\u2019t need it. Her world moved in lines and angles; she anticipated thrust and attack, deflected assault in calculated trajectories. Even naked she was a weapon.\nA dim glow illumined the end of the corridor. She headed closer, and suddenly she was engulfed in golden light, rapt before the vision of a mighty tree, a giant Golden Oak, the mirror of the one young Aishling saw on her old breastplate in the ashlands; the Eschatons found that relic eventually and scavenged it. Aishling remembered that afterward their days weren\u2019t quite the same; the daily hunt for ever-rarer shoots was tinged with subtle loss.\nSomething moved near the vision, as though climbing out of the wall; a figure, human sized. It was a shadow pushing into the light.\nShe lunged forward, lashed out, twisting her hands just so. Someone grunted. The floor before her twisted and snapped shut with a crack, trapping her target\u2019s leg tightly. Unbalanced, her victim yelled, turned. A man. His leg snapped at the knee as he fell to the ground. She stepped forward, hand to her waist, unsheathed her dagger and grabbed his head, twisted, slit his throat before the pain of his fractured leg translated to screaming.\nWith her hands warm with blood, her eyes refocused and clawed back sense from the golden vision. There was no glowing oak here at the end of the corridor after all, no admonishing ghost of the forest she had helped destroy. It was just a tapestry that blocked the entrance to the illegal teaching room, and the dead man in her arms most likely a lookout, or perhaps the teacher. The tapestry\u2019s tree motif had been woven from gold and crimson and emerald; it was glorious, but merely another dead image from an age gone by, illuminated by the flickering candlelight in the room beyond.\nThe children\u2019s song changed to an alien tune, full of melodic sounds that evoked root and tree and leaf. Elfsong? The dark lords\u2019 New Catholic Speech couldn\u2019t produce those ambiguous syllables.\nHer bloody hand, raised to sweep aside the hanging tapestry, faltered; she lowered it to her side, dug for the hard assurance of her old acorn in her pocket. Twenty years of nervous spinning had polished its surface to a cool familiarity, a charm to ease her uncertainties.\nAishling gritted her teeth and moved lightly forward, aside and through. The dozen children in the small room had their backs turned and didn\u2019t even notice her entrance, though the old man leading them in their careful song paled at the sight of her uniform.\nShe didn\u2019t move. Her eyes were locked on his and eventually he regained his composure a little and continued the song. His hand trembled as he turned a leaf of the thick manuscript before him.\nWhen it ended the children remained respectfully silent, absorbed.\nThe teacher stopped and looked up at her, until eventually the children followed his gaze. There was the soft rustle of shifting cloth, and suddenly the children\u2019s haunted expressions focussed on her.\nEsmeralda, she remembered. Torko. Sora. They had all been children not much older than these when the soldiers recruited them into the Forest Wardens.\nAishling glanced back at the oak tapestry, swallowed nervously. Her resolve split like an ancient tree trunk.\n\u201cYou\u2019re betrayed.\u201d The teacher didn\u2019t react, and Aishling had the barest instant to appreciate the risk she meant to him. \u201cStay here for now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m unfolding the building above. Before dawn, return to your homes.\u201d\nIt was as though a long-dormant hidden force compelled her. She half-turned, lifted her hand, and jabbed a finger at the tapestry, looking the teacher in the eye.\n\u201cI will take that.\u201d It was invaluable, almost as rare as the acorn in her pocket. The old teacher\u2019s eyes lit up at something he could understand: a corrupt official, a trade of their lives for a priceless artefact.\nAishling glanced at the children\u2019s scared, hungry eyes. She dug into her pocket with her clean hand as she stepped forward, crouched lithely before a girl no older than seven. How important to her parents was this unauthorised education, that they would risk her well-being so?\nShe placed her fist on the bench beside the girl. The black tattoos visible on the back of her hand sucked at the dim light. When she opened her fingers and lifted her hand, a single polished acorn remained, a soft golden curve in the candlelight.\n\u201cI took this from the old forests myself, when I was a child. It\u2019s. . . .\u201d She was talking only to the little girl now, while the class watched; she struggled to think of the word she needed. There was one, once, in her native tongue. Twenty years had dulled her mind and there was only the New Catholic Speech now. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . hope . . . a . . . an expectation of salvation. When you\u2019re safe, when you feel the time is right . . . plant it, water it. Bring it back.\u201d\nAishling never really understood why she\u2019d collected the acorns, but now she realised there was a greater purpose. Maybe these children, one by one, could help bring the trees back. Perhaps they could undo what she\u2019d wrought twenty years ago.\nBarely a quarter of an hour had passed when she closed the secret hatch and returned to the troops outside. She carried the Golden Oak tapestry rolled beneath an arm.\nThe troops had barely moved. Aishling took her prize and handed it to Abramelech as he hurried to her side.\n\u201cI found the hidden room as we were told, but it was empty save for this.\u201d She handed the tapestry to Abramelech and turned to the troops. \u201cI\u2019m tearing down this building. The citizens have to understand that the dark lords will not tolerate sedition.\u201d\nA hand wave urged the troops to pull back. Aishling approached the wall and primed seams, corners. She felt the distant Eschaton focus its awareness on the hall.\n\u201cBack!\u201d she yelled. The troops hurried to reach a safe distance from the building as her tattoos itched into life. Walls bent subtly, stone and mortar fighting reality. The corners and seams of the hall unfolded, curling inward on invisible arcs. The roof sagged, caught on the edge of the Eschaton\u2019s projected geometry. Half of it crashed to the ground in stone dust and the other half spiralled sideways, flinging roof tiles outward while groaning against its own nature.\nIt took very little time to reduce the hall to a wasteland of fractured debris and deformed stone blocks.\nAishling motioned for the soldiers to attend her and head out. She reached into her pocket for reassurance and found nothing there.\n\u201cAre we reporting back to Dark Lord Tanatloch tonight, mistress?\u201d Abramelech interrupted.\nAishling paused momentarily, regathering her thoughts.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n* * *\nTanatloch was formless, like all his kind. He was merely a black sentience squeezed from the void between worlds and extruded into a purple Man\u2019s robe. His gauntleted fingers tapped a pattern on the obsidian edges of his throne as Childfinder Aishling stood at attention before him.\nDark lords had no faces, but each craved uniqueness, and so Tanatloch once took a bleached Elf skull and pressed it like a helm onto the black flesh where his head would be. A circlet of silver coils was filigreed into its polished crown, and ruddy veined light glowed through the hollow sockets, appraising her. He glorified in becoming, in part, what he swore to destroy.\n(( IT SEEMS YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THE INQUISITION. CHILDREN ARE GLEEFUL AND OBEDIENT. )) Tanatloch\u2019s voice boomed silently; it was no more than a hissed whisper in the vast chamber of his audience hall but deafened like a thunderclap in her mind.\nTanatloch swivelled his skull-head and stared at the wall behind her. Aishling followed his gaze and was shocked to see a large tapestry of a Golden Oak, larger even than the tapestry Abramelech carried into the antechamber.\n(( DARK LORD ROKOGOGH MOCKS ME. HE GLOATS OF HIS VICTORY IN THE ASH WASTE BUT MY PACTS SOLVED THE BALEFIRE EQUATIONS TO ALLOW HIS INGRESS. THE CALYMMIAN CURSE WAS FORMLESS BEFORE I CALCULATED IT. ))\nAishling didn\u2019t care for the dark lords\u2019 rivalries but dared not show it. The curse was twenty years old, an eye\u2019s blink to the dark lords.\n(( FOR TEN YEARS YOU GIVE OAK SEEDS TO THE CHILDREN. WHY? ))\nAishling froze, shocked alert by the sudden odd accusation. She\u2019d gifted precisely one acorn in the twenty years after her time as a Forest Warden, just the one this very night.\n\u201cI . . . I collected them as a child. It\u2019s a . . . reminder of the dark lords\u2019 victory.\u201d Lack of preparation and confusion drained the conviction from her words.\n(( THIS WILL REQUIRE A RECKONING. )) He reached for her with gauntleted fingers.\nThe pain hit her in a wave, invisibly radiating and freezing her in place.\n(( LET US COMMUNE, DARK LORD TO SUBJECT. ))\n* * *\nAishling paces carefully behind Lachrim, trying to settle her breathing as he leads her through stone corridors. The path forks into larger galleries, stone steps and mezzanines overlooking vast depths. After the redoubt burst from the soil and ushered in the Harrowing, it left fearful gaping voids beneath it that to her knowledge have never been explored.\nThe throne room is unchanged from when she last stood there, when she retired her services as Inquisitor a decade ago, kneeling before the cuirbouilli scales of Dark Lord Krakatau.\nToday it is Tanatloch again. He waits by the throne and stares at her with his glowing Elf-skull eyes as she and Lachrim arrive. Would he even remember her after four decades? Time flowed in strange eddies for the dark lords.\nBefore she has a chance to determine the best position to strike at him, Tanatloch seems to remember something and strides directly toward her, stopping ten feet away. Lachrim obediently stands aside.\n(( FOR TEN YEARS YOU GAVE OAK SEEDS TO THE CHILDREN. )) Tanatloch says. (( WHY? ))\nAishling stammers, once again brought to confusion by the same dark lord. Her heart beats faster, hated memories of pain dragged from her, freshly horrifying. An answer escapes her across all those decades.\n(( DO YOU HAVE A SEED HERE, NOW? ))\nAishling can\u2019t muster the will to resist a command from this ancient creature. But can she still draw her sword and carve that Elf\u2019s skull from his head? Lachrim will hardly be a threat, but dark lords are unknowable things.\n\u201cI. . . .\u201d She reaches into her pocket and removes her very last acorn, displays it in her open palm. Tanatloch would need to step closer.\n(( WHY CARRY THESE DEAD THINGS? IS IT A DELUSION? ))\nShe doesn\u2019t understand. The dark lord speech booms in her head, dizzying her. Her tired joints stab at her as she shifts uncomfortably.\n\u201cIt\u2019s. . . .\u201d The time to prevaricate is over, the fire of her life has run its course, and with luck she can make a small difference as it winks out.\nShe stares directly into Tanatloch\u2019s ruddy eye-glow. \u201cIt\u2019s to remind us that the Golden Oaks will return, when the time is right and of mankind\u2019s choosing.\u201d\nTanatloch does not move. After a heavy pause he says, (( THIS . . . WILL REQUIRE A RECKONING. ))\nAishling acts. She jabs a sharp elbow into Lachrim and spins, twists, pushes through her own pain and breaks forward, drawing her sword in the same movement.\nTanatloch staggers backward. She channels decades of guilt and the memory of her last interrogation into a tight slash at his chest, but only splits the cloth. There is a coiling darkness beneath the cut in his robes.\nAishling presses her advantage. She hears Lachrim regain his footing and steps quickly sideways to keep him from flanking her. Lachrim has drawn his sword and rushes forward, but there are few who can match her skill, even slowed by her aged body. She raises her tattooed hand and unfolds the trajectory of his blow. Lachrim curses as his blade arcs in the new geometry of his immediate surroundings; he struggles to stay upright, his footing confused by incongruous planes and suddenly angled stones.\nAishling turns to Tanatloch and screams as sudden waves of agony radiate over her wrinkled skin, threatening to unravel her. Her acorn drops from instantly numb fingers, strikes the stone floor, and spins away. Her sword loosens in her other hand, tumbles free. Her body tires suddenly, begging her to succumb.\n(( YOUR ASSUMPTION OF OUR POWERS IN THE TIME OF YOUR BETRAYAL IS UNBEFITTING. )) Tanatloch steps forward, gauntleted hands open at his side.\n(( LET US COMMUNE, DARK LORD TO SUBJECT. ))\nShe grits her teeth at the remembered words, tenses her legs to spring away. This time she will not succumb.\n* * *\nShe was ensorcelled by electric blue, a thousand needles digging into her flesh, contracting it, voiding her youth and leaving it parchment dry. Fresh aches blossomed in youthful joints and black spots flirted with the edges of her vision as she sank to her knees. Beneath Tanatloch\u2019s relentless red gaze she had somehow become a timeless, aged, withering thing. She thought of her newfound tapestry in Abramelech\u2019s care, of the promise of that tree, of the little girl treasuring her acorn, of the other thirty-odd acorns still stowed in a bag in her quarters.\n(( IT SEEMS MERELY A COLLECTING GAME. ))\nThe dark lords often spoke without context.\n(( INDEED, EVEN AFTER THIS TIME I EXPECTED IT TO MEAN MORE, BUT IF IT IS AS YOU SAY. . . . ))\nBoth voices were the same. Tanatloch was discussing her aloud, with himself.\nShe finally pushed free of the compulsion, fell forward; exhaustion washed away the pain. Aishling felt inexplicably aged beyond her years. Tanatloch laughed, but it was a sound that reverberated behind her eyes only. By the time she looked up and the tightness of her skin had faded back to youth, he was gone.\nBut she had a sudden compulsion to run\u2014to run back to the antechamber, tear the tapestry from Abramelech\u2019s hands as she went, and go home, to dig through her acorns and find herself a new seed.\n* * *\nTanatloch\u2019s piercing laughter pulses in her skull as she regains her awareness, pushing upright against her aches, gathering her footing. The dark lord had faltered when she attacked but it had only been for a moment. Her treachery is for naught.\nLachrim steps closer, cautious, but she lunges at him, hands clawed. When he flinches she dashes past him, runs for the last shreds of her life, against all her plans, against the wishes of her ageing body.\nPain fractures up her shins and she leaps wide down stone stairways, losing her footing once and staggering before regaining her balance. Years of training only go so far; old ligaments scream at her for restraint.\nShe is First-Exalted-of-the-New-Order, an Inquisitor of the dark lords, but that no longer matters. Her years as Childfinder General lie forgotten behind her. Her last acorn is gone and her hoped-for revenge is ashes.\nSomething heavy slams into her side, shoving her into a wall. She throws herself sideways, whirls, and puts a hand to her sheathed dagger, searching for her attacker.\nInquisitor Lachrim sweeps forward, blade extended, and she manages to draw her dagger and deflect it as he thrusts past.\n\u201cYou refuse Dark Lord Tanatloch\u2019s . . . attentions!\u201d Inquisitor Lachrim slashes and turns aside. Aishling has her dagger and forty years of experience. It is a courtesy to him that she hasn\u2019t hamstrung him already.\n\u201cLet it go, Lachrim, it\u2019s not important.\u201d\n\u201cStand down, Inquisitor. I don\u2019t understand why you ran, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe dark lord was torturing me!\u201d\n\u201cThat is how Dark Lord Tanatloch shows affection.\u201d She sees his eyes flick left and right as he takes a measured pace back.\n\u201cHow can\u2014?\u201d But as she says it she realises his attacks have been mere diversion, that Lachrim has always known he was outmatched in swordplay by a seventy-year-old woman; he\u2019s been silently calculating and is even now channelling the dark lords\u2019 geometry.\nThe ground splits open beneath her and she stumbles forward, over. . . .\nThe stone walls grab her fast. Aishling hangs wedged, upside down, her shoulders grabbed by the very stones that had split and dropped her. A sharp pain cracks across her chest and the dim clatter of her dagger reaches her from the invisible depths below.\nShe hears Lachrim step closer above her, no more than a few feet away. \u201cYou\u2019ll be left trapped here as a warning, Inquisitor. The dark lords have always found you amusing, with your seed-gifting.\u201d\nAishling freezes, despite the pain and the cold of the vast stone chute sucking at her life\u2019s warmth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. Surely you didn\u2019t expect it to remain a secret? They watched you and find this, this. . . .\u201d He struggles for a word that does not exist in his masters\u2019 speech. \u201cThey find this expectation entertaining. It placates dissenters, carrying these acorns, and seeing their subjects carry dead seeds close to their hearts is a great source of amusement to the dark lords.\u201d\nAishling closes her eyes tightly.\n\u201cYour acorns can\u2019t sprout, surely you know that? Why do you think the Forest Wardens were disbanded after three years? There is no seed, not even the dead race\u2019s Golden Oak, that remains viable for much longer than that; the Wardens were no longer needed. And how long has it been now, sixty years? Does any man alive even remember what the Great Ash Wastes looked like before the Harrowing? Every one of those children who planted your seed was left treeless.\u201d\nTears sting in her eyes.\n\u201cI will fetch Kargoth. He will wait here until you are dead, and then dispose of your body. The dark lords thank you for your years of service. Consider a slow demise their gift to you.\u201d\nThe heavy tread of boots on stone mark his departure. The echoes fade into the distance.\nAfter an interminable wait, with her breathing becoming shallower and the pain in her chest blooming, she hears a new sound. This is a more hesitant shuffle. Kargoth.\n\u201cInquisitor Aishling?\u201d\nShe feels a rough hand reaching down past her wedged shoulders, patting her gently on the arm.\n\u201cAre you coming to kill me, Kargoth?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I have to wait.\u201d\n\u201cAre you coming to save me?\u201d\nA pause.\n\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s the dark lords\u2019 will.\u201d\nShe sighs slowly, trying to keep her thoughts focussed. After a short pause Kargoth speaks again, more quietly.\n\u201cI heard you were the oak planter. My ma had one of your seeds, did you know?\u201d\n\u201cYour . . . ? How did she . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cPassed down from her ma, Grandam Esmerald. Grandam never planted it, she said they\u2019d just dig it up and salt it.\u201d\nLittle Esmeralda, eyes wide and terrified, confused, clutching her acorn tightly in a scarred hand. Aishling had never seen her after their years as Wardens. Inquisitors aged well, civilians less so.\n\u201cYou. . . .\u201d Aishling has trouble breathing. \u201cYou have Esmeralda\u2019s acorn?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Ma inherited it after Grandam died and refused to let it go. Ma was buried with it. She said a Golden Oak would grow from her grave, but it never did.\u201d\n\u201cNo . . . no, it wouldn\u2019t, they\u2019re . . . they\u2019re all dead. They\u2019ve always been dead.\u201d Her voice cracks.\nShe feels his hands on her legs. He pulls once, twice, then with another snap of pain she is suddenly, amazingly free, lifted up toward escape.\nKargoth helps her out of the hole and wraps her in a warm blanket. A golden light, like the vision of the Golden Oak in that hidden secret school, fills and warms her chest.\n\u201cWe need your help. You know the dark lords best of all, and now they think you\u2019re dead.\u201d\nShe coughs, her head light as the blood rushes back through her body, cradled in his arms. She says nothing, closes her eyes to recover.\n\u201cI want you to have this,\u201d Kargoth says eventually. \u201cInquisitor Lachrim found your acorn and Dark Lord Tanatloch ate it. But . . . but I have this.\u201d\nSomething hard drops into her palm. Her dry fingers explore its shape, familiar and round, pitted at the top. Is it another golden acorn? It feels too light, too smooth. A coughing fit shakes her and she spits blood. Her lungs ache from the cold air.\n\u201cMy friend is good with wood, Inquisitor. He carves them. We ran out of real Golden Oak seeds years ago, but it didn\u2019t matter; it doesn\u2019t matter because it gives us the expectation of salvation. There are many acorns now, more than you ever found in the ash wastes; hundreds. And we want you to come with us and plant them all.\u201d\nAishling grimaces through the pain. \u201cBut you can\u2019t plant wooden acorns. What\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\u201cWe do plant them,\u201d Kargoth whispers, closing her fingers tightly around it with his hand. \u201cWe plant them in fists.\u201d\nTom Dullemond stumbled out of university with a double degree in medieval\/Renaissance studies and software engineering.

A six-foot-tall man could lie down on the wooden floor, put his feet against the back wall, and his fingers would have easily reached the front door. He could have touched both walls in the other direction in this manner, as well. There had been plans to add another room, but an unexpected inheritance had made the big house possible just as the family was outgrowing this one. And that was the end of the family\u2019s time in the cabin.\nThe cabin had two windows, their ancient glass panes wavy but intact. This, also, may have been due to the privet. No errant balls or stones could hit the cabin with enough velocity to break the glass.\nIn the far, dark corner of the cabin stood an old pie safe, one with tin sides and doors decorated with hex symbols. Surely, though, this piece of furniture must have been a later addition. Why would the family have left something so sturdy and useful behind? Even if they could not have used it, might it not have found a purpose among others on the farm? But if not the family, who would have left it there? The dust was no help. It covered everything in the cabin to the same depth, making the pie safe look contemporary with the window panes.\nIt\u2019s what was in the pie safe that is of interest, though. Here on the top shelf was a small, ancient doll, its head carved from a wooden block, horsehair escaping its body at the seams. Next to the doll was a half-moon of teeth, laid out according to some secret sacred geometry. The third item was a blue ribbon with an unrecognizable medal at its end. Strangely, though the medal was covered with corrosion, the ribbon still looked as fresh as the day it was made.\nThe whole of the second shelf was taken up by a crocheted baby blanket, as if someone once set an infant on the shelf, carefully and snuggly wrapped in this afghan, and the baby had long turned to dust, leaving only the blanket behind. Who would have dared move the folded edges of the blanket aside to see what bones may have remained?\nOn the bottom shelf, there was a big quart jar of marbles, most with the slight dimple that suggested their origin, and a Matchbox Mustang, from a year when they were square and ugly. The only other thing on the shelf was a man\u2019s heart, which had left a dark stain on the wood beneath it. It seemed as if you might, if you touched it, have felt the faint ghost of its beating.\nThere was a new style over the old stone wall, the wood still fresh and yellow, waiting on someone to purchase the homeowners association\u2013approved specific shade of white, an antique color with hints of yellow and gray in the undertones, picked to match the columns on the big house. There was a plan to dig out a section of the creek to make an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d swimming hole for the community\u2019s residents. It might have needed to be fenced off\u2014codes and all\u2014but the HOA was sure such fencing could be done in a discreet and charming manner.\nThe swimming hole was planned for the portion of the creek that ran right behind the cabin. Times are different now, it\u2019s true. Some things they used to tear down as a matter of course, they preserve now. But look at this floor! Here, by the door, a board is missing, and this one, right where you\u2019d think to step to bridge the gap, is too weak to hold most people. Generations of swallows have nested in the rafters, using that hole right at the roof\u2019s peak as an entrance. Mice and raccoons and sometimes foxes have taken refuge under the house. Their fleas leap and test all fresh flesh that enters.\nThis is a place too tempting for children and too dangerous for them. And even if they made it safely across the hazards of the floor, even if the fleas didn\u2019t bother them, even if the birds were away, what of the old pie safe? What mother would want her sweet cherub to come home with those teeth or that Matchbox car, his hands stained from holding this heart?\nNo, once they learn the cabin still stands, once they cut back the privet for a better look, it\u2019ll be lucky if they just knock the cabin down. More likely, after they open the pie safe, they will burn it to the ground.\nOne cold morning, when the moon still hangs in the blushing sky, when the mist rolls down out of the hills and flows along the old dirt lane, we may see a breeze catch the fog and toss it swirling up into the vague outline of a man. The eye begs to make order out of chaos and will suggest a human form even in the most inhuman shapes, it\u2019s true. But look here as his knee bends the crease in his gray pants. Look at how his gloved hands tug at his frock coat, as if he has been sitting while traveling and is finally able to adjust his clothing. He checks his top hat next.\nIs he going someplace dressed so formally? Just returning? Do the joggers up in the neighborhood see him? Only the sad boy\u2014a discomfort to his parents\u2014in the upstairs window of that far house seems to notice, his mouth a knot of surprise and fear. He does not look away, though. Some part of him suspects he\u2019ll never see the likes of this man again. Not in this life.\nWherever the well-dressed man\u2019s final destination, the old cabin appears to be a necessary stop for him. He climbs the two stone steps to the door, opens it as if it never groans against all other efforts to enter, and navigates across the floor with the assurance of someone who does not fear falling.\nHe smiles as he touches the door of the pie safe, reminded of something private he shared, but his face falls when he sees the contents of the safe, a story in a language only he can read. There is the doll she brought with her from Virginia. It sat on her tiny lap across the mountains and through the gap. She held it in her arms and comforted it when she, herself, was afraid of death. She came to believe it was very lucky, and she never would have willingly left it behind.\nHere are her father\u2019s teeth, the guardians of the tongue that lashed her when she announced her love for the fancy-dressed man. After her father beat her into promising that she would marry only who her father named, there had been an incident, an accident of sorts, which left her father unable to name anyone at all.\nWhich suited our dandy man just fine, for he had no name.\n\u201cI promise to buy you a bunch of blue ribbons. I promise to buy you a bunch of blue ribbons.\u201d\n\u201cWhat color blue?\u201d\n\u201cLike this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this medal for?\u201d\n\u201cIt was due me. I promise to buy you a bunch of blue ribbons to tie up your bonney brown hair.\u201d\nAnd here is the blanket that wrapped their first child, who took two breaths and died, nameless. The top-hatted man knows if the afghan is empty. And though he seems to want to touch it, to pick it up, to rub his cheek against it, he does not. Instead, he closes his eyes and for a moment dreams that the child lived. She was never the same after that, and though they had talked often of a large family, he could only bring himself to put her through it once more.\nWhen he felt assured that both she and the second child would live, he left his new family. Surely her brother, who had inherited so well so recently, would take care of her and her daughter.\nOur dandy opens the jar full of marbles and pulls one out. Testing its weight in his hand, he has the overwhelming sensation that this had been done before, that some young boy with his same raven-dark hair had often held these marbles in this same manner, knew each one\u2019s size and weight and how it rolled when struck by a shooter.\nSo his daughter had grown and had children of her own.\nAnd the Matchbox car could only mean a descendant further down the line. Would that child still look something like him? Was there still something wild in the family, some unworldly strain? Or had all trace of him faded from the world?\nHere, here is his own heart, which he cut out and left with her when he could bear his love for her no longer. Should he take it back? It appears to still be in working order. He still felt the ache of its absence and so he knows it would fit once more in his chest.\nAnd yet, retrieving it would be a lie of sorts, a claim that his heart was no longer hers. When, even now, he would dig her up and knock her bones together to hear some sound of her. He would drape himself in her jerkied flesh and run his tongue along the curve of her skull, dirt and putrid rot no concern to him. He would howl until every coyote for sixty miles cried with him. And he would sing the song that could bring her back.\nExcept he promised her he would not. Promised her that he would let her live and die and stay dead as an ordinary woman. And he, so in love, agreed. And he, so in love, still, abides by that promise.\nThere is no saving the cabin. Men wrap the feral privet in chains and drag each bush from the ground by truck. The arching trees, children of those that fell to make the cabin, succumb to chainsaws in an afternoon. One is left to serve as a bench for the bathers who will need to rest when the swimming hole is complete, and when it falls, the weight of it hitting the ground breaks the windows in the cabin.\nThe cabin comes down with a nudge from a Bobcat, crumples to the ground like a woman in grief. A handful of marbles roll toward the creek and rest now, presumably, at the bottom of the swimming hole. The other things\u2014the rest of the story of their life\u2014end up in a dumpster and then in a landfill.\nOnly a handful of summers go by before the dapper man returns, rolling out of the early morning mist like a dream half-remembered. He smiles to himself as he strolls down the lane until he fails to reach the cabin.\nAnd now he does howl, cries like a dog left behind. He stands waist-deep in the swimming hole that occupies the place where his heart used to rest, flailing his arms until the water foams around him. The boy who saw him once before is grown now. The young man sees him from his parents\u2019 kitchen window and the young man shakes his parents awake, begs them to flee with him, and, when they will not deign to even humor him, he leaves them behind and drives to Kentucky.\nThe police will question him, after they pull the six boys from the swimming hole, their blue bodies lifeless, black fingerprint bruises at their ankles. But he is, indeed, back at school and has been for days when the incident occurs. The terrible accident. He will say he saw a man, impossibly thin, impossibly tall, as graceful as a dancer. Had he seen him before? And what had he noticed about him then?\n\u201cHe terrified me,\u201d he will say. \u201cI thought he was a ghost or a demon or something.\u201d But his cheeks will flush.\nOut beyond the big house with its massive Greek columns, behind the pool, farther than the tennis courts, past the library, beyond the far cul-de-sac, below the rose garden, on the other side of the stacked stone wall, across a muddy service road, along a creek, near the abandoned swimming hole sits a fat log.\nOn the log sits a thin man who has no heart. Next to him sits a young man whose curiosity has overcome his fear. The past is gone and irretrievable. When the young man offers him his hand, he takes it. When the man in formal attire asks his name, he tells it. When the mist finally clears, they are gone.\nBetsy Phillips is the author of A City of Ghosts.

{"fingerprint":"VJ8ZjF9GTe7d9x8SNGkkI-0Z0oI","title":"A Ring of Red and White","author":"Willow Fagan","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"My parents\u2019 wedding rings were carved to resemble twists of barbed wire. They were so realistic that often, when my mother was typing, the ring would bite into her skin, flinging droplets of red onto the clean white of the paper.\nThe red does not stop there. It keeps falling, deeper and deeper, staining the edges of my dreams.\nOne night I dream that my mother\u2019s ring has been transposed to my finger, shrinking itself to fit snug against my skin. My skin is covered with panicked cattle. My body is a pasture. The cows stampede back and forth, round and round, kicking up bruises on my skin. They cannot escape; they are trapped by the barbed wire rooted in my finger. Their udders swell painfully, bursting with pus. They moo pitifully. Beyond the spiky ring, my finger extends into a graceful bridge, beautiful and unreachable.\nMy grandfather was a TV news anchorman and a necromancer. I only ever saw him on the television screen, sitting behind a desk in a somber suit and a bright red tie. From time to time, he would pause in his delivery of the latest demoralizing news about the war and wink, and then address our family directly, as if he were sitting in our living room with us.\n\u201cNow, Bill,\u201d he would say, speaking to my father as if he were a child, \u201cyou are remembering to chew your food before you swallow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nMy father would only grunt in response.\nMy father was dead, but my grandfather kept bringing him back to life. Each night, my father sat at the dinner table with my mother and me, his flesh rotting away. Chunks of his hand fell into the soup as he clumsily ladled himself a serving. Broth splashed, soaking my mother\u2019s freshly pressed white blouse. But she continued chewing silently, staring straight ahead as if she wore blinders. She chewed and chewed and chewed, until surely the mashed potatoes had liquefied in her mouth. Still she chewed.\nOne night, I stayed up late, watching television alone. A horror movie was on, some low-budget production about a sadistic dentist who placed tiny bombs in his patients\u2019 cavities.\nToward the end of the movie, the dentist\u2019s assistant\u2014an annoyingly perky blond woman\u2014was eating ice cream when blood started to pour from her mouth. Thick and unnatural looking as lipstick, the blood flowed into the ice cream, swirling around and around like chocolate syrup until the camera itself tilted and spun and slowly fell into the disc of red and white spinning like a hypnotist\u2019s charm. And then the assistant appeared onscreen again, chipper as ever, wielding the silver ice cream scoop as if nothing had happened. I wondered if the filmmakers were being surprisingly experimental, but when the scene began to repeat for the four or fifth time I concluded there must be some malfunction with the equipment at the TV station.\nBy now, the hygienist\u2019s hungry smile and her exaggerated sighs of pleasure as she took the first few bites had taken on quite sinister undertones. Each repetition of the scene was like a fresh cut in the same line of skin, deepening the sense of wrongness. I winced when the blood spurted, despite its ridiculous, clearly fake nature. I shook my head when the assistant appeared once again, smiling brightly as she opened the freezer door.\nFinally, my grandfather stepped in front of the spinning disc, looking like a game show host. He grinned and waggled his finger at me. It was the first time I had seen him standing, his legs not hidden behind a desk. His pants and his shoes were disappointingly normal.\n\u201cMost of the time, you understand, I draw my power from reruns,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cThe undead forms of shows shuffling ceaselessly across channels. But sometimes I need a little extra kick.\u201d\nBehind him, the blood-streaked ice cream began to rotate in the opposite direction.\n\u201cOnce you know the trick, it\u2019s not so hard. You just bend time into a little loop and then tie it round itself.\u201d\nI must have grimaced, for my grandfather chuckled and said, \u201cBe careful making that face. It might get stuck that way.\u201d\nMy dad pokes his head into my room, fresh faced and smiling. His skin is healthy and white, with no trace of rot.\n\u201cYou up for a board game?\u201d\nI hesitate, thinking of the time his hand fell off as he was rolling the dice.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll buy you an ice cream after . . . if you win.\u201d\nI grin. I can\u2019t resist ice cream.\nMy dad sets out the Sorry board. It\u2019s so good to see him like this, full of life and energy.\nI reach my hand out to move a piece. He grabs my wrist. Something moves in his eyes, green and nauseous, like a rotten log falling through.\nI know better than to protest. I remember now. This has all happened before.\nMy skin is still as ice, with bright red explosions frozen beneath.\nMy father lifts my fingers to his mouth and begins to chew.\nThe first time, I yelled, \u201cDad! What are you doing?\u201d\nHe would only grunt, \u201cFlesh of my flesh. I gave life to this body, and I can take it away.\u201d Or maybe he only grunted nonsense syllables and I concocted words, cobbled them together from other places.\nMy father\u2019s teeth gnaw into me like chainsaws, but when he is done my skin is smooth and unbroken. When he is done my skin is invisibly altered. It\u2019s something beneath that he is devouring.\nEach time he eats away a new part. My ankle, my shin, my thigh. My lips.\nLater, when I look in the mirror, the skin there will be as white and bloodless as the petals of a lily.\nSoon there will be nothing left of me.\nAnd then my body will begin to rot, and my mother will stare straight ahead, chewing, as I clumsily poke a fork through my cheek and my tongue tumbles onto my white plate. And then my grandfather will use the power of reruns to bring me back to life.\nThe blood drips on the white of the page.\nThe finger plops into the steaming soup.\nThe ice cream swirls.\nMy dad\u2019s teeth tear at my skin.\nMy grandfather chuckles.\nThe blood drips. . . .\nMy parents\u2019 wedding rings were carved to resemble twists of barbed wire.\nWillow Fagan lives in Portland, Oregon, which he likes to imagine as a giant terrarium.

Cataneo","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"When Bird with his crown of black roses disappears from the clearing, Genevieve knows she and Joseph won\u2019t be safe anymore. At night, while Joseph sleeps, she sorts the walnuts and lingonberries that Bird gathered for them to eat, counting fewer each time. Her stomach aches, and she flinches at the rustle of the skull kings in the ghost forest beyond the clearing.\nSometimes, she clambers up trees, her boots slipping on bark, straining to hear the rustle of Bird\u2019s wings, the growl of his caw.\nNight after night, Bird doesn\u2019t return.\nNight after night, the skull kings crunch through the undergrowth, closer and closer.\nBird always protected them, as long as Genevieve can remember, since she and Joseph picked bittercress in the clearing as children. Then, Bird loomed taller than both of them. In summer, he plucked fruits and nuts from the trees\u2019 highest branches, and in winter, he draped them in his glossy black feathers, sheltering them against whipping ice.\nHe protected them the first time the skull kings attacked. Small skull kings, the skulls of mice and voles, had always chattered in the weeds that ringed the clearing, and once or twice larger skull kings had flashed among the translucent trees of the ghost forest. But on that day\u2014an autumn day, when Joseph sat drawing beneath an elm tree and Genevieve swung from its lowest branch\u2014a scream tore through the clearing, and a wall of bone materialized out of the hazy ghost forest. A skull king, the skull of a giant raptor or dinosaur, hurtled toward them. It swerved on treaded tires through the weeds, looming over Genevieve.\nShe screamed. She threw her arms around Joseph and pressed his head against her shoulder.\nBut Bird leapt into the air, flapping immense black wings, squawking in a language that Genevieve didn\u2019t know. The skull king screamed back, a sound that came from its mouth even though its long-dead jaw didn\u2019t move. Decaying plants swayed in its eye sockets, scraped against the inside of its cranium.\nBird squawked again, and the thin autumn sun caught the velvet petals, the thistle and thorn, of his black rose crown.\nThe skull king growled, but it reversed, retreating toward the ghost forest.\nBird landed among the ferns and flowers, wrapped Genevieve and her brother in his wings and crooned you\u2019re safe, little children, you\u2019re safe.\nGenevieve snuggled against his downy feathers, knowing she would never come to harm.\n\u201cWe have to find him.\u201d Genevieve gathers crooked sticks out of the bed of moss and decaying leaves on the clearing floor.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about the skull kings? Tap them to death?\u201d Joseph strokes the thin stubble on his hollow cheeks. \u201cGenius.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave during the day, so the dangers in the ghost forest won\u2019t be quite as bold.\u201d\n\u201cGen.\u201d Joseph runs his fingers along an oak\u2019s trunk. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re. . . . I don\u2019t think he wants to be found.\u201d\nGenevieve feels for a second as though she\u2019s floating and about to fall. She cranes her neck at the cerulean sky above the rustling leaves, forces in a breath. Then she breaks off an oak branch. The snap echoes through the clearing, and Joseph jumps.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find Bird,\u201d Genevieve snarls. \u201cHe told me about other clearings in this forest, other safe havens. He must have gone to another one of those, and we\u2019re going to find him. That\u2019s the last I want to hear about it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why you\u2019re so fixated on finding Bird,\u201d Joseph mutters.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to keep us warm when winter comes? Gather food for us?\u201d Genevieve jabs a finger toward their meager collection of walnuts and berries sheltered in the roots of an elm tree. \u201cWho\u2019s going to protect us from the skull kings?\u201d\nJoseph presses his hands against his stomach. \u201cBut if we go into the forest, there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll avoid the skull kings.\u201d\nGenevieve ignores him and stacks her weapons.\nThroughout Genevieve\u2019s childhood, Bird told her stories: how Genevieve and Joseph had come from far-off forests called cities, where food and safety are in short supply. How parents from those places sometimes decided they couldn\u2019t care for their children, so they swaddled them in blankets and brought them to the forest and found bird-protectors to watch over them.\n\u201cWhat happens if parents can\u2019t find a bird-protector?\u201d Joseph would ask, looking up from his sketchbook. And Bird would quickly launch into another story, perhaps about how he had become a protector by gathering the black roses of his crown from the rot-stinking undergrowth of the ghost forest. How you needed three roses to create a crown, how the crown conferred magic onto him so the skull kings shrank away.\nAnd Joseph would throw down his pencil and ask, \u201cWhy can you speak to the skull kings, Bird?\u201d\n\u201cYou and your questions,\u201d Genevieve would say, smacking her brother on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt Bird\u2019s story.\u201d\nBut as the years passed, Joseph\u2019s blunt questions gnawed at Genevieve, as the skull kings chomped at the weeds at the edge of her haven and Bird, their protector, shrieked in a language she didn\u2019t know.\nOne night, last summer, she watched Bird as he sat at the edge of the clearing, his wings folded tight and his eyes glinting as they stared into the dark.\n\u201cBird,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you speak the skull kings\u2019 language?\u201d\nBird didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cBecause going into the forest to gather black roses bears consequences.\u201d\nOn a bright day in mid-autumn, Genevieve steps out of the clearing for the first time, slipping between two oaks into the ring of weeds between the clearing and the ghost forest.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she hisses at Joseph, who\u2019s teetering behind her, and she strikes out through the waist-high weeds. Something rustles a few feet to her left.\n\u201cJoseph,\u201d she calls. Her brother appears behind her, she grabs his clammy hand, and they race forward, until the weeds dwindle away.\nGenevieve rubs her arms as she steps into the ghost forest. She cranes her neck at the gnarled trees, with their heavy translucent leaves and hulking branches. She has never seen trees like this, so different from the straight, proud oaks and birches of their clearing.\n\u201cI hate this,\u201d Joseph mutters. \u201cDo you hear that sound? What is that sound?\u201d\nThe forest breathes, a humid sticky breath, emanating from the trees, from the loam beneath their boots.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hurry.\u201d Genevieve strikes off due north\u2014Bird told her that the nearest clearing is a three-week journey north of them\u2014and her feet crunch against the jet-black tangle of spiked and thorny plants on the forest floor.\nAs they wend their way north and the light dwindles, the hairs stand on Genevieve\u2019s neck and she jumps at the crunch of her own footsteps. She\u2019s wondering when they should stop for the night when something flickers through the fog.\nThe whine of wheels skidding on soil, and then it hurtles toward them, the white of the skull flashing from trunk to trunk.\nGenevieve\u2019s stomach leaps as Joseph whimpers behind her. She wants to scream for Bird, but instead she hurls a stick. It skitters and falls on the undergrowth nearby.\n\u201cLeave us alone,\u201d Genevieve shouts, then throws another stick. This one slices through the trunk of one of the ghost trees, disappearing in the dusk.\nThe wheels grind toward them, and Genevieve and Joseph run. Genevieve\u2019s breath tears in her chest, but they sprint until they no longer hear wheels behind them, until, for now, they have outstripped the skull king, survived another day without Bird to cradle them in his soft wings.\nThat night, they find a patch of forest floor with few thorns and spikes, and they huddle in the flat white light of the dead trees around them.\nGenevieve rummages in her coat pockets, extracts a handful of berries and two walnuts. After they gobble their meager supper, Genevieve listens for the rustle of skull kings while Joseph sketches the translucent trees. He keeps scrubbing his eraser against the page, and finally, he sets his pencil down.\n\u201cWhat do the skull kings do to you, do you think?\u201d His voice quavers.\n\u201cThey eat us, don\u2019t they?\u201d She clenches the stack of branches she gathered in their clearing.\n\u201cDo they?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, I . . . of course, of course that\u2019s what they do.\u201d Didn\u2019t they? Isn\u2019t that what Bird told her? He must have said so, at some point.\nJoseph bends to his sketchbook. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d\nGenevieve frowns. She examines the plants next to her, brushes aside a few crinkled bits of burned paper, and prods a thorn. The thorn crumbles away, and something glints underneath: black velvet petals, a black stem, five prickly sepals beneath the cup of the flower.\nGenevieve plucks it out of the loamy ground, and Bird\u2019s absence floods her, as though the black rose in her fingers is poison. Nearly a full season has passed since his feathers and roses gleamed in the crisp clear air in their clearing. Every fiber of her aches for him to pad through the ghost forest toward her.\nShe allows herself to acknowledge that Bird is not her father or mother\u2014those mysterious creatures who abandoned her and Joseph long ago\u2014and not just her friend. For a second, she\u2019s suspended, her breath stolen by the thought of all she wants Bird to be.\nThen she forces a breath into her chest. There\u2019s no use thinking about it. She\u2019ll reach the other clearing, she will, she\u2019ll throw sticks at the skull kings and protect herself and Joseph, and then she\u2019ll find Bird, waiting for her.\nJoseph watches Genevieve\u2019s serious face in this forest\u2019s sinister light. Hunger claws at his stomach. He shoves it down, and in its place rises worry about his sister. She\u2019s so brave about journeying through the forest to find Bird, and yet so blind about questions that seem obvious to Joseph: What do the skull kings do to a person? Why is she so sure Bird\u2019s in the other clearing?\nAnd, most importantly: why does she think Bird wants to be found?\nJoseph loved their childhood too; in his memory, their youth in the clearing plays like a lullaby. But the night Bird left, Joseph saw him slink out of the clearing. Bird\u2019s glassy, indifferent eyes fell on Joseph, and Joseph knew: Bird didn\u2019t want to protect them anymore. It was over.\nThey would have been better off staying in their clearing and building a life without Bird.\nBut Joseph has never been able to persuade his sister of anything.\nGenevieve and Joseph trudge through the ghost forest as its breath grows cold, as leaves drop onto Genevieve\u2019s hair then melt away like mist, as the skull kings\u2019 shrieks slice through the night and Genevieve clutches her black rose.\nOne day, they climb an incline in the forest, and before them spread trees of hoarfrost, with needles made of thin slivers of ice and snow plump around the bases.\nGenevieve clutches the black rose that\u2019s pinned into her hair. She shivers and longs for Bird to drape his black wings around her like a blanket.\nAs she and Joseph crunch through the snow, a carcass looms behind the hoarfrost trees. It\u2019s made of rusty metal, with four rubber tires, and no roof, and snow drifting over leather seats.\nAs Genevieve edges forward, wings rustle. Her stomach leaps at the sight of feathers, of a beady eye\u2014\nBut the bird that rises from the metal carcass is tawny, with short prickly feathers and a dilapidated crown of wilting black flowers. This bird cocks his head at them. One of his eyes is milky and floats in its socket.\n\u201cChildren,\u201d he wheezes. \u201cWhatever are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a bird, a black bird, with a black rose crown.\u201d Genevieve\u2019s voice sounds small in the snow-muffled forest, and she clears her throat and says louder, \u201cHe\u2019s left for some reason, and we\u2019re going to find him.\u201d\nNot-Bird\u2019s good eye roves over the leather seats of the metal carcass. \u201cI had children, once.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d Genevieve says.\n\u201cThey left you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Joseph says.\nGenevieve frowns. \u201cWhy would they leave him? He was their protector.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big world.\u201d Not-Bird scrapes his wing against the snow that\u2019s accumulated on the carcass\u2019s metal rim. \u201cBeyond the ghost forest there\u2019s another forest, of glass and steel, called a city, and still other forests of salt water beyond that. I suppose . . . I suppose they wanted to see the glass and steel forest. I told them that\u2019s where they came from, and they began asking so many questions.\u201d\nWhy would those children leave? Why would they forego safety and brave the skull kings to journey to this glass and steel city forest?\nHad they grown weary of the same seasons marching by, year after year after year? Had they wanted to know why their mothers and fathers abandoned them?\nAs Genevieve ponders this, tires screech in the snow.\nA skull king veers toward the metal carcass. Gray moss flaps from its eyes, from its gaping mouth.\nIt cackles as it careens towards them.\nGenevieve swivels towards Not-Bird, who rises from the carcass, emits a weak caw, flaps crooked wings.\nThe skull king is only five paces away from them.\nGenevieve snatches her black rose from her hair. Her rucksack tumbles from her shoulder and flops into the snow. Her fingertips tingle as she thrusts the rose in front of her. \u201cStay away from us,\u201d she shouts.\nThe skull king veers to the left, wheels skidding, then corrects course, heading for them. Genevieve flings herself in front of Joseph, knowing one rose isn\u2019t enough, the skull king is going to crunch her, eat her, destroy her. . . .\n\u201cI know,\u201d Not-Bird shouts, rising out of the carcass, and then he shrieks and spits in the skull king\u2019s language. The skull king screams back, and as it reverses into the forest, its tires crunch over Genevieve\u2019s rucksack.\nAs the skull king vanishes, Genevieve falls to her knees at the rucksack and paws at the fabric with trembling fingers. But the berries are crushed, juice stains Joseph\u2019s sketchbook, and most of the walnuts are broken. As Genevieve picks pieces of their meat from shattered shells, she aches for Bird to return so she can shake him and scream you left us, you left us to starve, the people who were supposed to be our mother and father asked you to protect us and you failed. . . .\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Joseph says. \u201cGen, we\u2019re going to be so hungry. We\u2019re going to . . . to. . . .\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll manage.\u201d Genevieve wants to scream at him too, because of course she knows they\u2019re going to be hungry, and she can\u2019t watch Joseph\u2019s cheeks grow gaunter.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a protector,\u201d Not-Bird says, good eye roving over Genevieve. \u201cYou, with your black rose.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Genevieve says.\n\u201cI wish I could offer you food, lost children,\u201d he wheezes. \u201cI have none. But I must give you something else.\u201d\nHe plucks a shriveled black rose from his crown.\n\u201cI have four of them,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need it more than I do.\u201d\nGenevieve accepts the rose from Not-Bird\u2019s wing, her fingers tingling. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a protector. I just want to find Bird.\u201d\nNot-Bird avoids her gaze.\n\u201cWhat did you mean, when you shouted at the skull king that you knew?\u201d Joseph says.\nNot-Bird flutters his thin wings. \u201cWhen the skull kings speak, it\u2019s painful, little children. What they know . . . it hurts my heart.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do they know?\u201d Joseph asks. But Genevieve grabs his hand, thanks Not-Bird again, and pulls her brother north, deeper into winter, her pockets weighed with their last remaining bits of walnut.\nThe night Bird disappeared, summer mosquitoes buzzed around Genevieve\u2019s neck and ankles. She stood beneath the clearing\u2019s tallest oak, staring at a branch three feet above her head. She\u2019d been trying to climb this tree all summer, and she ran her fingers over the bark, searching for a pattern of footholds.\n\u201cGenevieve.\u201d Bird rustled next to her, and Genevieve\u2019s stomach leapt. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the sort to fall asleep easily.\u201d Bird\u2019s wing fell against the back of her hand. Genevieve\u2019s skin prickled. \u201cYou\u2019ll sort out a way to climb it. You always do.\u201d\nGenevieve felt a smile spreading her mouth, the kind of smile you can\u2019t control.\nBut then Bird said, as though the thought had just dawned on him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to run out of trees to climb in this clearing eventually.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nHis beady eyes roved toward the ghost forest. In the dark, his eyes reminded her of the skull kings\u2019 eye sockets. And the question tumbled out.\n\u201cBird, why can you speak to them? You never told Joseph.\u201d\nBird didn\u2019t answer. A mosquito landed on her ankle and she ignored it. The air between her and Bird was too thick, and her cheeks burned. Was it ordinary, for a girl to feel this way about a bird? She didn\u2019t know. No one had ever told her.\nBird shifted, and then a pinch on her ear: his beak closed around the soft skin there. She bit back a gasp, and then Bird shrank away, his eyes not meeting hers. He padded into the clearing\u2019s shadows, until his black feathers blended into shadow and she couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and the night began.\nGenevieve and Joseph reach the new clearing after three weeks and five days in the ghost forest, a week after the skull king trampled their rucksack.\nThe trim oak trees, the slender birches, the bare-branched maples all resemble their clearing. And high above their heads hang glowing winterberries, the last overripe walnuts, the bounty of early winter food that Bird once gathered for them.\nBut Bird is not there.\nGenevieve stands beneath the trees, snow plopping off their branches into her hair.\nWhat would he say, if he could see her here? Her ear has healed, but her boots are broken. Her ribs protrude against her coat. She is so small, in this clearing so empty of Bird.\nJoseph\u2019s hand lands on her shoulder. \u201cGen, I\u2019m sorry. I knew . . . he didn\u2019t want to be found. He left us, all right? I know it\u2019s. . . .\u201d\nHe left them. Bird left them. He left me. He doesn\u2019t love me.\nThe truth settles on Genevieve\u2019s shoulders like the snow blanketing the forest.\nHe left me. And now there\u2019s no one to keep us safe.\nExcept for the black roses blooming in her hair.\nShe drops Joseph\u2019s hand. She stumbles into the ghost forest, ignoring Joseph\u2019s shouts.\nBird left them, with his black rose crown.\nHe left. He\u2019s gone.\nGenevieve kicks at the snow. She scrapes it away, down to the dirt beneath, her fingers scrabbling against thorns. No soft stems or velvet petals curl from the frozen earth.\nShe stands and runs on, farther from the clearing, ignoring Joseph\u2019s shouts, searching for the last black rose she needs to become their protector.\nThe skull king watches the girl zigzag through the forest, tears freezing on her pale cheeks. The skull king\u2019s gray moss trembles, and it senses something else: a crust growing over this girl\u2019s fragile heart, like ice freezing over snow. Something soft seeping away from her, forever.\nThe skull king started out its life much as this girl did. Its parents brought it to the ghost forest, searched for a bird-protector to take it off their hands.\nBut unlike this dark-haired girl, this girl who grew up cosseted and loved in a bright clearing, this child\u2019s parents gave up before they found a bird-protector, and they left it at the base of a ghost tree and disappeared. Starving hurt, but thirst choked the child first, and after all that was done with, the child curled beneath a tree, and watched an animal skull roll by on a simple set of wagon wheels.\n\u201cHelp me tell everyone,\u201d whispered a voice from inside the skull. \u201cHelp me tell everyone how they left us.\u201d\nAnd so the once-child floated into an abandoned beast\u2019s skull that nestled in the soft soil. Burning with truths about the hearts of humans and birds, it rolled itself onto tire treads and set out through the forest, to tell everyone.\nThe skull king has seen girls like this so many times, and it knows that its work will be easy. So easy. How many lessons has it taught to birds, to boys and girls, in all those years? Yes, two black roses glow in this girl\u2019s tangled hair, but black rose crowns are flimsy bulwarks against the skull king\u2019s dangling moss. Temporary, fleeting measures.\nThey blame me, but I only tell them the truth.\nThe skull king creaks forward, waiting.\nGenevieve paws through snow and dirt, her fingers purple. She knocks aside a bundle of thorns, and then something glimmers.\nGenevieve yanks the rose out of the earth. Bird\u2019s betrayal hits her again as her fingers clench around this last addition she needs for her crown.\nSomething rumbles. Genevieve\u2019s eyes rise from the black rose to a wall of white bone. She cranes her neck up.\nThe skull king\u2019s nose arcs over her head like a sword. Its eyes are dark and its fangs bare in a deadly grin.\nGenevieve doesn\u2019t have time to raise the black rose.\nTendrils of stinking moss snake from the skull king\u2019s eye sockets and loop around Genevieve\u2019s arms and burn through her coat and she doesn\u2019t let herself scream. The moss raises her to her feet, her boots scrabbling against the frozen ground. The moss tightens and the skull king shrieks, a piercing shriek that rips through Genevieve\u2019s eardrums and shivers her spine.\nAnd Genevieve understands what the skull king says: Someone always leaves, in the end.\nGenevieve\u2019s first thought: I know.\nBut she snarls, in the same spitting language as the skull king, You\u2019re wrong. Not everyone is like Bird.\nYou\u2019ll see, shrieks the skull king. Black roses wilt. Girls begin to dream of other forests and boys decide their stubborn sisters aren\u2019t worth the trouble. No one stays, in the end.\nGenevieve rips at the moss. She raises her right hand. The black rose glows and the skull king shrieks. The moss springs from her arms, and she stumbles through the forest, cradling the third black rose in her hands, until she reaches the clearing.\n\u201cGen.\u201d Joseph lunges towards her. \u201cAre you. . . .\u201d\nShe pulls the other two black roses from her hair.\n\u201cI\u2019ll protect us,\u201d she says. \u201cI will, Joseph. I will.\u201d\nJoseph grins, and Genevieve concentrates on her brother\u2019s face, trying to ignore the far-off shriek of a skull king, in the language that she now understands all too well.\nGenevieve crouches in the snow, weaving the stem of her third black rose into a nest of thorn and sapling branch. She adjusts the roses so they lie in a straight line, then settles the crown onto her head. She shudders as its vines and thorns scoop up strands of her hair and weave through it. She blinks in the glow of the roses above her eyes.\nHer heart aches for Bird, but her fingers tingle hot with her new power.\nShe leaps toward an oak tree and climbs, her boots finding the right footholds in the bark, her arms barely straining as she pulls herself up. She reaches a clump of berries and rips them down, then circles the tree and pulls down a handful of walnuts.\nWhen she returns to the ground with overflowing pockets, she and Joseph sit cross-legged and stuff their mouths, and then when they are finished Genevieve wraps Joseph\u2019s cold fingers in her newly warm ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Bird,\u201d Joseph says softly. \u201cI truly am. But now . . . this is better. Now you wear the black rose crown, and you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Joseph smiles, hopefully.\nShe says nothing.\nSomeone always leaves, in the end.\nThe skull kings are not the true danger. They only echo truths, truths about Bird, truths about her.\n\u201cGen? You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re not going to leave me, are you?\u201d\nNo. She is not their parents. She is not Bird. She tells herself that she will be different. She lunges forward and embraces her brother, her hot fingers digging into his shoulder blades. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you,\u201d she whispers, and she squeezes him tighter.\nBut as she holds him, snug against her heart, she\u2019s already dreaming of the other forests.\nEmily B.

I was an archaeologist, an anthropologist, a chef, an architect, a psychologist, and a writer. In college, I went on expeditions looking for ancient ribs poking from the earth like compound fractures. I scoured worn editions of texts with thick covers and cracked spines for intricate recipes. I cooked and computed and asked my subjects invasive questions about their upbringing. I scanned the edges of a bit of reed from an ancient flute or the curled scrap of animal skin that was once pulled tight over the frame of a small drum, and learned of long-dead women who danced and sang and drank and made love to its rhythm. But before all that, I learned to sew. And even though the knowledge of needle and thread was one thing you were never much interested in, you should know that our people\u2014the women you come from\u2014were great seamstresses.\nI spent my childhood underneath a cutting table or at the foot of sewing machines in the sweatshops of downtown LA. I sat on the floor collecting remnants of tulle, silk, and lace, feather-light linen, and eel-slick nylon that had drifted from my mother\u2019s deft hands. I gathered the leftovers together and saved them in my pockets. The whisper and crinkle of pattern paper and the clean sound of scissors biting into fabric were my lullabies. The hushed rustle of my pocket when I found an especially beautiful piece among the fragments of lam\u00e9 or velvet and the drone and heat of so many machines working together were a comfort. From my position on the floor I would watch women\u2019s legs, strong and vericosed in nude stockings, and was mesmerized by their feet tapping up and down on their pedals. They could hem a dress with a perfect blind stitch, create backstitches, whipstitches, princess seams, and darts.\nAs I got older, I thought my mother and her friends fretful, fearful. Perhaps cowardly. Not much different, I\u2019m sure, from how you think of me when I ask you what you want to do with your life. Dragging their daughters with them, my mother and the other women she worked with came together on their precious days off in a circle of comfortable chairs to quilt. Oh! Our outrage at being forced to sit on someone\u2019s porch or in their dark, sticky den and watch our mothers waste their days away, their work blanketed across their laps, their baskets resting at their feet, overflowing with strong thread, thimbles, scissors, and seam rippers. We practiced black eyeliner calligraphy and sounding bored, and we pretended that we hadn\u2019t already learned how to take old, outgrown clothes and recycle them into patterns of contrast.\nThey would begin by stitching an echo around a simple latticework design made from remnants of a dark chocolate housecoat contrasted with a sunny yellow spring dress or fragments of a navy pantsuit, balanced against bits of a light floral blouse. Then, all of them working together, they crafted another echo around the last, measured out with a finger or thumb. When I became too bored to fake disinterest, my mother taught me how to start. Thread a needle, tie a knot in the end of my string, pull it into the middle of the quilt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t,\u201d my mother warned, \u201cthe whole thing will eventually come apart. It will hold together for a while, but when it finally comes undone it\u2019s fast and messy.\u201d Their wrists flicked up and down, thimbles and needles flashing in and out of their palms, stitching over and through the same patterns, reinforcing them. \u201cWe hide our histories here,\u201d my auntie told me one Saturday. \u201cSlip a stitch here. Slip a stitch there. Hide a story in an imperfection. To keep them safe, make sure they survive.\u201d\nI fostered the idea of you for years until I finally began to draw up a blueprint. I pulled my old drafting table from the garage and cleaned it off. After I dug up my compass set, scale, and triangle, I went to work on the clean scroll of paper before me to define the elegant curve of your perfect heart and the contours of your strange mind. Draft upon draft. I couldn\u2019t get it right. I already loved you too much to let anything go. But my years of studying taught me\u2014the herringbone pattern of a brick dome, the savory-sweet bitter salt of a twenty-four hour sauce, the delay and desire of a well-crafted sentence\u2014these things are not just artful manipulation and control. Allow the patterns to emerge, to develop. Don\u2019t hold too fast to your original idea. Be patient, I told myself, and began to draft again.\nWhen I knew I had taken my draft as far as I could, I began to gather raw materials. I started with music. I reached out to the Sisters of Mary Immaculate Queen whom I met back in college, when I was doing a research paper on sociocultural evolution and faith-based music. They were reticent at first, knowing that I was an atheist. But when I explained to the Mother Superior that this was my destiny, she said, \u201cNearest thing to heaven is a child,\u201d and told me I would be welcomed. I traveled back to their convent in Spokane, and they put me up in a spare dormitory with a wrought iron twin bed, a small oak nightstand, and a print of the Virgin Mother staring at me from the far wall. They asked me not to interact with the children enrolled in their school and to maintain an appropriate level of modesty during my stay. I sat in the first pew, staring at the four-tiered riser of royal blue nuns as their voices rose and echoed off the gilded pulpit and the Stations of the Cross. I took a glass vial from my purse and filled it up with the pure and complete faith they had in themselves.\nI captured courage and humility in much the same way\u2014filled a small, unassuming vessel to the brim. These things I didn\u2019t even have to steal. So many women gifted me their best. A chef gave me her height and her wonderful, adventurous hunger. A scientist who used to be my lab partner in school shared her radiant curiosity with me. My friend, a poet with golden eyes, tucked a bit of her own playfulness into my hands and told me to squander it all when the time came. But I have to tell you that even with all these gifts, I needed to become a thief in order to create you.\nI began training. I set up an obstacle course in my backyard to get fit. After a minor setback when I broke my wrist falling off the rope climb, I could feel myself gaining strength\u2014body and mind. I bought a Swiss Army knife and a lock-picking kit from an online spy store. The lock-picking kit came in a soft, black leather pouch and looked to me like a set of dental instruments. I tackled each doorknob in my house like I was cleaning the plaque from inside its keyhole crevices. Soon they were all broken or had fallen off completely. I couldn\u2019t even shut the bathroom door. But by then, no locked door could keep me out. I never did figure out safe cracking, but the grappling hook and the glass cutter came in handy after all.\nThe Cleopatra exhibit was traveling from museum to museum across the country, so I didn\u2019t have to travel to retrieve all that blistering power or worry about having to transport it back home with me. I waited for it to come my way instead. A bit worried about metal detectors or searches, I was still prepared with my knapsack full of gear. When nobody stopped me or asked to check my bag, I roamed through the exhibits, making sure to avoid the one I was actually there for\u2014too afraid my nervous excitement would give me away. Fifteen minutes before the museum closed, I slipped into the women\u2019s bathroom and climbed on top of the toilet in the last stall, then up into the air duct. It was so dark I couldn\u2019t see anything, and the cold sheet metal held me in place until my organs ached.\nMy alarm went off, alerting me that everyone except the security guards had gone home. I shimmied my way back to the exhibit and took out my grappling hook and attached it to the opening in the ceiling. The nylon rope I dropped from the ceiling coiled onto the marble like a snake. Moments later, I rappelled down the frescos high up on the walls and into the main exhibit room. With the glass cutter, I removed a perfect circle from the case displaying Cleopatra\u2019s jewels. It held intricately roped necklaces, filigree earrings, and a simple golden arm cuff that I extracted and rested on top of the display case. I brought out my fingerprint powder and duster. With a few light flicks I coated the piece with a sooty layer until the echoing whorls of a queen\u2019s fingerprint appeared.\nWatching that pattern emerge brought me back to those weekends around the sewing circle making echo quilts with the women who raised me. I realized I had started to cry when my tears fell into the powder, turning it into ink. After I stole the fingerprint and put it in my pocket, I returned the cuff to the black velvet pillow inside the case and shimmied back up my rope before the security guards found me. It took forever to sneak out. I waited in the air duct, my cheek resting on the icy metal, carefully stroking the print. It gave me strength and patience to think of what I had secured for you. When I got home, I put the print into a mortar and crushed it into smithereens. It crackled and sparked every time I brought the pestle down, releasing all its power. I scooped it up with a teaspoon and put it in a Tupperware container in the fridge to keep it from exploding.\nI took my time collecting everything else. Humor was the toughest. I really had to search, ignoring all those people who told me it would be impossible to find, much less steal. The stand-up comedian I finally stole from caught me red-handed, laughing so hard that I thought I was going to pee. In the end, she let me keep the humor. \u201cAfter all, getting a laugh out of someone always feels a bit like stealing,\u201d she said.\nIt took me two years to weave the treasures I had amassed into a heavy fabric. It was dangerous work. The small vial of faith from the Sisters of Mary Immaculate Queen was so noisy, it gave me a headache if I handled it for too long, and I could work with only small doses of the power I kept stashed in the fridge. Too unstable. It had to be handled with gloves and diluted before it was manageable. When I finished I held the fabric to my cheek to see if I could feel how everything fit together. I wrapped my arms around it and inhaled its clean scent. I took the edges of the fabric and threw my arms up over my head, lifting the creamy expanse into the air and sighing as it drifted back down to earth. It was another year before I could bring myself to go any further. I was wary of making a mistake. Some nights I would wrap the bolt of fabric around my shoulders and climb into bed and dream of you.\nFinally, I worked up the courage to cut into the cloth. I cut it on the bias\u2014deceptively complicated. I knew that if I failed to take special care, if I didn\u2019t exert all my patience, if I rushed, you could lose all your potential for a graceful flow. The seams would pull together, collapsing in on themselves rather than lying smooth and perfect. I didn\u2019t bother recreating those lines onto sheer paper or superimposing a pattern onto the fabric. I knew you too well by then, even before I was finished. I cut out the important pieces and let the scraps fall to the floor. I tacked the pieces together and let it hang for a day or two, adjust to my exacting measurements. When I took it to my machine I went slowly, allowing the fabric to take its natural shape, instead of pulling it through. I stitched in short, controlled bursts, letting the fabric relax before continuing. When I was almost finished I poured all my best into the one seam still open at your side\u2014a thousand different elements, each one perfectly weighted and measured until you were filled up. That last seam I sewed up by hand, and as I finished, an unraveling inside me quickened. I made perfect stitches, like my mother, my aunties, and their mother taught me. But I slipped a stitch or two on purpose. The imperfection is barely visible now, a pale seam right below your rib cage.\nSome things I could not have foreseen. There are things that might have slipped in by accident. And then there are the things I had no hand in at all. Perhaps when I stole the fingerprint, I stole a bit of the curator\u2019s print as well. And then there\u2019s the me that I gave to you. I tried to distill only my best, but maybe I wasn\u2019t as careful as I thought. That could explain your moodiness, your temper, your bouts of sadness. But what of your love of bad romance novels and your distaste for spicy food? That is something I would never have suspected. When I think too long on it, it is as if there is an unraveling inside me that quickens. Now that you tell me you want to create a daughter of your own, what can I tell you? I cannot give you blueprints. You have to make them on your own. You can take from me what you want and leave the rest. I can rappel down a wall like a soldier, I can write a story, I can excavate shards of pottery from a site, I can cook a nine-course meal. And I can sew.\nI can\u2019t teach you the way I was taught, tucking scraps of knowledge into your pockets, your hand, your mind\u2014bit by bit.

Robinson","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"She has heard of you, scar breeder. Your names are stories in the rampion yards of Rasia and each one whispers down the caravan roads. She listens. You have laid tracks down the wrists of old women. Young men boast in their mead halls that they do not fear your phoenix-bone knife, though they live in the shadow of your tower and will not speak your name.\nShe has come to your city by moonlight, tracing your feet. She wears a madder-root cloak and the stones do not tremble when she walks. Her skin is pale, her eyes the green of poison apples. They call her the Saint of the Dreamless Sleep, scar breeder. She has come for you.\nShe watches for days, you are so terribly strong. As you lead your nightly caravan through the streets, the palanquin carried by a dozen child-brides, she stalks the rooftops. When your little girl-child Marga cannot keep up, and is whipped for her weakness, she digs half-moons into her palms. The girl\u2019s eyes are green like beryl. As you drink black plum wine from the vintner, Argise, she hides in the thick-beamed roof darkness. It is the last keg from the year his daughter died, long-saved against the hard times. She watches as you do not pay for it. You do not see him cry and whisper his daughter\u2019s name to the empty cask.\nShe makes herself watch you in the serail. She keeps to the shadows as you loosen the belt around your waist and let it fall in a spray of discarded bones. The women are frightened by your footsteps, you can taste their fear and it makes you drunk. You roll it on your tongue.\nShe had painted the inside of your cup with poison, scar breeder. It will not kill you, you are too strong, too mighty for that. Scar breeder, you let your squid-skin robe fall. You are beautiful in the lamplight.\nShe traces the scars on your skin with her eyes. They make a coat along your wrists, woven like fine linen, and trails up your elbows, down the contours of your chest. They are thick where you have tried to carve out your broken heart. There are chasers up the hollows of your neck, small ones around your eyes and lips.\nShe knows they are your power. Each cut of your skin has made you stronger, as they grow like vines up the lattice of your bones. No needle, no garrote, no blade will take your life. The Saint of the Dreamless Sleep watches you stride across the pale marble floors, seeking.\nShe waits as you find dear dark-haired Immat, hiding in the shadows. You can smell her private spice of fear. Like sycamore, sumac, and hot sand. Immat is your favorite, with her dark hair and bottomless eyes. She spoke seven languages and you have taken each from her, a night at a time. Scar breeder, you have taken Immat\u2019s polyglot tongue.\nShe watches as you leave the girl unharmed. The lights shine strangely to your eyes. It is red and green and you are growing warm, you remember a girl with green eyes that you loved once. It is the poison\u2014oak gall and the crushed hair of a unicorn. It is a draft to make men mad and as you reach the door to your tower, there is nothing left inside you but swimming vision and memory.\nShe catches the door when you kick it closed. No one has seen her take the stairs behind you. There is no one in the tower to watch what follows. You do not bother to light the candles. You throw yourself on the bed and then, you remember nothing but the press of her flesh, the heat that burns beneath your scarred skin from remembered kisses. You mean to take your knife to Immat that night, but forget as need takes thought and action and there is nothing left but her and you.\nShe is there, on the bed, the Saint of the Dreamless Sleep. She has watched you long enough. You do not care that she has made deathcraft an art. You reach for her, unknowing, and she turns to you.\nShe does not fight when you press your mouth to hers. You taste her tongue, which does not belong. It tastes of grit and Argise\u2019s plum wine, the fall of the whip on Marga\u2019s back, the shallow cut of your phoenix-bone knife against Immat\u2019s tongue. You open your eyes. It is too late, scar breeder. You whisper her name from the bottom of your broken heart. You had never thought to see her again.\nShe is astride you when you feel it. There is pain inside your throat and you try to claw it out. It grows inside you and as you try to get air to scream, it is too late. She is green eyed in the darkness. Your mouth erupts\u2014green trailing vines. They pour from the edges of your lips and down across the bed. You cannot contain them.\nShe reaches forward and runs her fingers down the thick ridges of your forehead, down the bridge of your nose. The assassin touches the vines, which have begun to carpet the floor. Purple flowers have grown too, which she caresses, then down and across where you have tried to cut your heart from your chest.\nShe leaves you as she did before, but now the rampion grows up the walls. Her madder-root cloak leaves no trace of her. She is a master of her profession and you are her responsibility. The rampion seeds take root in the darkness of your stomach and grow and grow until there is nothing left of you, the bedroom, and the tower, but the stories of the scar breeder whispering down the caravan roads. You have left a scar upon her heart.\nShe loved you once, before.\nSean R. Robinson is a science fiction and fantasy author who calls the White Mountains of New Hampshire home.

{"fingerprint":"JtTUPOZLqJbrMZsH5ZyjsxEKSfA","title":"Robbie\u2019s Zona Cero","author":"Mark Rigney","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"Not many remember Robbie October. From 1970 to 1981, guitarist and singer for Powderkeg. He penned many of their songs, although the hits all came from founder Geoff Harrison. Hits or no, Powderkeg was cursed. By 1983, every album they\u2019d ever made was out of print, even those that had been wildly successful. Did any musicians in history have such a run of bad luck, bad advice, and devastating lawsuits?\nOf the four members, two took their own lives: death by hanging. Drummer Todd Russell died a decade or so after the band\u2019s final stalled attempt at resuscitation. He was forty-three. Only Robbie, that damaged pearl, remains.\nI met Robbie just once, in 1984. Inexplicably, he was working the counter at Cut Outs, a humble used record shop in Columbus, Ohio, which is a very long way from Robbie\u2019s native Liverpool, and even farther from the hot lights and packed houses of Powderkeg\u2019s starstruck heyday.\nIt was a school day in March, chilly and gray. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be off the grounds, but I had a free period and a car (just as secondhand as Cut Outs\u2019 stock), so, rather than continue to educate myself about Tecumseh and the Logan Elm, I opted to expand my musical horizons.\nCut Outs faced North High Street, four lanes of stoplight traffic hemmed in by miles of shoulder-to-shoulder brick-fa\u00e7ade shops, broken by canyons of cross streets. An old blues tune played on the stereo as I entered, a Texas-inflected shuffle, fast paced and (for a blues tune) happy. The place smelled musty, like dorms and mildewed basements. From inside the moldering LP covers, you could almost hear strangers\u2019 memories, an overdub straining to escape the endless vinyl grooves. I thought I glimpsed, as I always did on entering, the ghosts of failed rockers sailing through the shadows, humming along to the music and hoping against hope that some final scrap of their output might still be purchased, hugged to the chest, borne home.\nRobbie and I were the only people in the shop. He was bouncy and short and still looked remarkably like Ringo Starr.\nI asked him for help finding a forty-five called \u201cThings Get a Little Easier,\u201d something I\u2019d heard once on the radio but hadn\u2019t caught the artist\u2019s name because my little brother was holding forth about the history of tennis.\nI think Robbie enjoyed the hunt, fingering sleeve after almost-identical sleeve. His fingertips and mine both came away coated in a grimy papery dust that no CD shop will ever know. He tallied up the bill of sale by hand and said, as I headed out the door, \u201cCheers, mate.\u201d\nAnd that was it.\nWhat more could there have been? I was fifteen, a cynical and reclusive high school sophomore. I had acne and a shoulder full of chips.\nSo of course that was \u201cit.\u201d\nI pointed up to the enormous overhead poster promoting Powderkeg\u2019s new (in 1973) album, Midnight Apple.\n\u201cExcuse me, but that\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nRobbie eyed the shiny brown poster warily: four pleased-looking longhairs, all dressed in brown against a leather-brown background. A study in brown, that photo. Brown fading to deepest blue. \u201cSecond from the right,\u201d said Robbie. \u201cDifferent times.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cDo you miss it?\u201d\nRobbie laughed, humorless and quick, over and done like a match blown out. \u201cNot photo shoots, mate. But playing, being on stage, those were better days. Anyone out of the game misses that. Anyone who says otherwise, well, I\u2019d call \u2019im a liar.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cHiding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends here. Met \u2019em on the road years ago. Decent people, good musicians\u2014that\u2019s the name of the game. You know how it is.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t, but I smiled and nodded to show that I did, and Robbie rang up the sale. Outside the dusty window, a grumbling city bus drove a wedge through the traffic, and I saw Robbie\u2019s eyes follow it as if he wished he were aboard, as if that old soot-encrusted behemoth could up and fly him out of Ohio and right back to amplified stardom.\n\u201cMy life,\u201d said Robbie, \u201cit\u2019s not had what they\u2019d call a cracking good result. I\u2019m thirty-seven, mate, and I\u2019ve run my wicket. This is s\u2019posed to be the prime of my life\u2014but I went from gold records to laying carpet. Thirty-seven and done. How old are you?\u201d\nI told him. He chewed on the answer as if I\u2019d pushed a cherry pit into his mouth, but he said nothing.\nIn that moment, I was moved as I\u2019d never been moved before, not by starving kids in Ethiopia, not by the aged in nursing homes (where my high school Dixieland band sometimes played), and certainly not by the plight of people in general. What child of fifteen can work up any empathy for a concept like that? But for a fraying, lonely rock star, washed ashore on what I took to be my doorstep, I had empathy in spades.\nBesides, I was a fan.\n\u201cRobbie, do you wanna maybe go get a sandwich?\u201d\nNo immediate response.\n\u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019m buying.\u201d\nWe went to Bernie\u2019s Bagels, an Ohio State campus hangout. Robbie had a pastrami on rye; I had the turkey club. I told him about what I listened to: Madness, Strawbs, Fairport Convention. Powderkeg, of course. The Clash, Pretenders. Not a lot of teased hair and synthesizers in that pile. Not exactly the hit parade of 1984.\nRobbie had favorites I\u2019d never heard of, Czech bands, Russians, South Africans. He asked me what I thought of shape singing. He went off about Chopin\u2019s Nocturnes. I had only the most vague idea of what he was talking about, but I finally screwed up my courage and told him I played keyboards.\n\u201cMeaning what?\u201d he asked. \u201cPiano or organ?\u201d\n\u201cBoth,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd trumpet.\u201d\nRobbie grinned.\nWithin the week, we\u2019d recruited a drummer and a bass player and formed the Robbie October Express. I got the requisite Ohio work permit and dropped out of school. That summer, we placed a hip, sexy video on that brand-new bauble, MTV, and within two months of that, we\u2019d played the Roxy and CBGB\u2019s.\nRock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Robbie called, \u201cyou forgot your change.\u201d\nI had one hand on the door. The little brass bell tied to the top had already let out a faint, expectant jingle. Such a flexible word, change. Robbie, I thought, change!\nI couldn\u2019t bear to see him shipwrecked like this, and I tried to say something coherent, like, \u201cKeep it, it\u2019s yours,\u201d but then I realized this would come off as condescending, the sort of comment one tosses on the heels of copper dropped to a beggar on a chilly street, and that epiphany left me so tongue-tied that I not only didn\u2019t know what to say, I no longer knew how to move.\nMy shoulder was on the door, and the door was opening outward, and as it did, I was tipping out with it, a human glacier tilting helplessly into the street. I glanced back, and Robbie had me fixed with his huge eyes\u2014little planets\u2014and I could see that he understood perfectly my sickened hesitation, my desire to race pell-mell away not just from him but from anything that might suggest my own life-story didn\u2019t come affixed with a guaranteed happy ending. Worse, my hesitation seemed to send Robbie flashing backward, and I watched as, for an agonizing heartbeat, he relived the collapse of his own personal velocity, the mudslap of tarnish on his shiny, happy, rock band aspirations.\nPower-pop: that\u2019s what they called Powderkeg\u2019s music in its heyday. Power-pop. Such irony. What power remains in a popped balloon?\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Robbie, \u201cstop in again.\u201d\nBreath held as if the cessation of breathing could, in and of itself, right the universe, I staggered onto the sidewalk. Never, I told myself. I will never let that happen to me.\nRobbie rang up the sale on the register and said, as I headed out the door, \u201cCheers, mate.\u201d\nI gave him the sort of perfunctory smile-and-wave that people do when coming and going from places and people to whom they have no significant connection, but I didn\u2019t quite get away. The telephone rang. Robbie jumped as if he\u2019d been stung.\nThe phone rang again.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Robbie called, \u201cwould you mind picking that up?\u201d\nI had one hand on the door, one foot practically outside. I looked at Robbie\u2019s stricken face. I looked at the telephone, a large black rotary sitting next to the shop\u2019s turntable. The dependable old Bang and Olufsen had been playing a long-deleted Albert Collins LP, but now, as if in perfect synch with the blaring telephone, it allowed the stylus to drop comfortably atop its armrest.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do I say? \u2018Hello, Cut Outs\u2019?\u201d\nRobbie sidled into a corner and put up his hands, as if to ward off the still-ringing telephone. \u201cAnything you like,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t answer right now.\u201d\nI shrugged, walked back to the counter, and stretched for the phone. The coil dragged as I pulled it toward my ear. \u201cHello?\u201d\nThere was a long pause. I pressed the receiver closer, but all I caught was what sounded like a sigh, swallowed by the rush of wind and a lively crackle of static. (In those days, we didn\u2019t have dropped calls. We had bad connections.)\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said again, sensing there was someone there, and sure enough, I heard a small, throat-clearing cough.\n\u201cCheers,\u201d said a male voice, a British tenor, cracked from too many cigarettes. \u201cIt\u2019s Evan.\u201d\n\u201cEvan who?\u201d\n\u201cEvan Davis. Put Robbie on.\u201d\nEvan Davis: Powderkeg\u2019s bass player, and the second band member to hang himself. I didn\u2019t know the ins and outs, but from what I\u2019d read, I was pretty sure that Robbie and Evan hadn\u2019t parted on good terms.\nWhat to say? How best to run interference between two former bandmates, one lost in the heartland of a country not his own, the other a ghost clinging to life through a static-filled telephone line?\n\u201cHi, Evan,\u201d I said. \u201cRobbie\u2019s not really here right now. Can I take a message?\u201d\nEvan snorted a laugh, the laugh of a man who wasn\u2019t too thrilled to be dead.\n\u201cI like that,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Not really here.\u2019 So he\u2019s there but won\u2019t talk, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t have to look at Robbie to know I was correct not to put him on the line.\n\u201cWell, listen,\u201d Evan went on, \u201cI won\u2019t keep you. I just rang up to say I\u2019m not angry anymore. Will you tell him that? Tell him that as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s over. He can move on.\u201d\nI watched the base of the phone slowly tipping like an iceberg onto its side as I pulled still further on the reluctant cord. I watched the second hand on the wall clock glide past the twelve. I watched anything but Robbie.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when the line went dead, and the only sound left in my ear was the dial tone. At the same moment, the stylus lifted on the turntable, shifted itself sideways, and plunked down with that fumph that you never hear on compact discs. As I reached over to hang up the receiver, a bluesy rhythm section kicked in, dusky and dark, a shuffle overlaid with the razor-wire attack of Albert Collins\u2019s guitar.\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Robbie. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 Like the song.\u201d\nRobbie wagged his head back and forth, denying this, denying that. \u201cHe says that every time he calls. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d\nConfused, I said, \u201cWhat do you want him to do? Chew you out?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even believe it\u2019s really him! Do you?\u201d\nHad anyone asked me, ten minutes before I entered Cut Outs that day, if I \u2018believed\u2019 I would soon be meeting Robbie October, I\u2019d have said, \u201cNo way.\u201d Now here was Robbie asking if I believed in telephone ghosts.\nThe turntable stylus lifted again, advanced half an inch, and reset itself on the spinning record. And then, as we both watched, it did it again.\n\u201cIt always does that,\u201d Robbie said. \u201cFirst Evan calls, then the bloody turntable\u2014Christ. I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d\nI gestured at the door. \u201cI think I need to get back to class.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, all right, then. Sorry \u2019bout all this.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d I smiled, because smiles are easy to give, but I stopped short of saying, \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d Friends can\u2019t do certain kinds of shovel work. And besides, we weren\u2019t really friends.\nI left. Robbie remained, and through the glass, I could see him staring with wide, frightened eyes as the stylus rose and fell, dancing to its own internal music.\nAn old blues tune played from the stereo, a Texas groove, fast paced and (for a blues tune) happy. Robbie and I were the only people in the shop. In fact, we were just about all there was, period. The wall decorations were gone, the countertop was bare, and the display shelves were completely empty except for traces of dirt, hair, and dust bunnies.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201cwhere\u2019d all the records go?\u201d\nI knew I was face-to-face with Robbie October, and I knew I should be impressed and point at where the now-absent Powderkeg poster had been and say, \u201cThat was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Instead, it was all I could do to take in the suddenly real possibility that my favorite store in all the world might be going under, and that I\u2019d somehow missed out on who knew how many chances to learn, listen, and absorb new music.\nEven the resident ghosts had fled.\nRobbie brushed his long, straight hair out of his eyes and giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s all out back,\u201d he said, and he pointed through the interior door. I knew that if I proceeded far enough down the dim, claustrophobic hall beyond, I\u2019d find a second door leading out to the alley where I\u2019d parked.\n\u201cEverything?\u201d I said.\n\u201cEverything.\u201d\nThis sounded demented. Nobody warehouses records outside. And besides, I\u2019d just come from the alley, and there weren\u2019t any records there. Just a door in an unremarkable brick wall with the words \u201cCut Outs\u201d painted on by hand.\n\u201cGo see for yourself,\u201d said Robbie. He giggled again in a way that suggested nothing here was funny, that nothing ever would be funny, that humor itself had just been outlawed.\nI walked through the shop, picked my way down the dark hall, and pushed open the rear door. Outside was a vast, level plain, partitioned by cinderblock walls that ran for as far as the eye could see. Directly in front of me, sitting at a junky metal desk, was a heavyset Mexican man, thickly mustached and wearing a plum-colored button-down. He was reading the classifieds of a very yellowed newspaper, and barely looked up as I appeared.\nIt was warm, suddenly sunny. Without really meaning to, I let the door swing closed behind me.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d\n\u201cNo s\u00e9,\u201d the man grunted. \u201c\u00bfEn qu\u00e9 te puedo ayudar?\u201d\n\u201cYes, s\u00ed,\u201d I answered, pleased that I could sort out what he was saying. \u201cBusco los discos.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, and he pulled a clipboard out from behind the desk and scanned its attendant papers. \u201cPor all\u00e1. Para m\u00fasica de Se\u00f1or October, cero.\u201d Then he paused, frowning deeply. \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo se dice \u2018zona\u2019 en ingl\u00e9s?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201c\u2018Zona\u2019? It\u2019s just \u2018zone.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cPues, Bueno. Zone.\u201d And then, in heavily accented English, he said, \u201cYou go to Zone Cero. You will find what you need, mi amigo. That way to the end, then a la izquierda.\u201d\nThe most sensible idea, retreating back into Cut Outs, did not even occur to me. I was bound for Zone Cero, and nothing was going to stop me.\nUnder my feet, chalk-white gravel crunched. I followed a road wider than a two-car garage and stretching on and on, indefinitely. Above, cornflower blue, unbroken. On either side, in large bays hemmed in by the cinderblock walls, lay unbelievable piles of junk. The junk was sorted by type. One bay might have pink pacifiers, another one rigid blue insulation. Over there, broken Naugahyde recliners, piled to the sky. In the bay ahead, on the left, comic books: Casper the Friendly Ghost, from top to bottom.\nI trudged on, thirsty now, less certain, and my shoes scuffed up little puffs of dust. At last, a new horizon line hove into view: another wall, more gray cinderblock. There were no signs, no maps, but I turned left, confident that the man in the plum shirt wouldn\u2019t lead me astray.\nHe didn\u2019t. A short way on, I came upon a pair of storm cellar doors mounted right smack in the middle of the roadway. The doors were painted pine green, but they were peeling badly and showed many other colors beneath: a rainbow of paint jobs, layered like tree rings, each layer leading farther inward.\nA dry wind came up, and I had to turn away to shield my eyes from blowing dirt and grit. When it subsided, I looked again at the doors and found words had formed, letters made of shifting, whitish dust: ZONE CERO: THE PLACE OF PERSONAL LOSS. In the surrounding bays lay mounds of Hershey\u2019s candy wrappers, a host of broken ukuleles, a massive slush pile of outdated gas station maps. Each separate, each its own withering, rotting heap.\nI ignored the rapid pounding of my heart, and pulled open the left-hand storm door.\nInside, stairs led down. Infinitely, for all I could tell.\nI threw both doors wide (they slammed loudly on the gravel, old wood smacking older stone) and descended the stairs.\nAfter ten steps, I had trouble seeing my way. After twenty, I had to keep a hand to the wall. After thirty, the light had all but gone, and by forty, I proceeded entirely by touch.\nI lost count of the stairs.\nI lost count of everything except the task of descending without tripping and tumbling helplessly down into the never-ending, timeless dark.\nJust when I came to the conclusion that I\u2019d been tricked, that I\u2019d better go up before someone closed the cellar doors, my fingers found a gap to my right, and my feet reached a floor. Very cautiously, hardly daring to breathe, I felt my way along the nearer wall. Nightmare images of labyrinths filled my mind, and I pictured Theseus stalking the Minotaur. Unlike me, had Theseus had the sense to bring light?\nI found a door. Or, more properly, my fingers found a door. I turned the knob, stiff with age and disuse. It opened, and daylight flooded in. I blinked, shielded my dark-adapted eyes, and tried to adjust.\nTo my surprise, I was back on the level plain, or perhaps some other part of it, and all around me lay piles and piles and endless piles of Powderkeg albums. They were all jumbled together, most in their sleeves but some not, and I could see all the important titles like Better Days and Midnight Apple, together with obscurities like Perfection, and battered forty-fives, Greek-issue singles of \u201cCome and Take It,\u201d the Swedish release of \u201cNo Matter When.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t begin to guess how many records lay moldering in that piled-up mound. Millions, maybe. Maybe every record the band had ever sold.\nI climbed that vinyl mountain, I scrambled right to the highest peak. I stood and gazed across that otherwise empty plain of dust and watery sunlight, of wind and memory, and I wondered what it would take to finally throw this avalanche of music away.\nAnd then, just as I was about to climb down, it occurred to me that someplace out there, I might be building a mountain of my own. Not of records, perhaps, but maybe something disastrously similar.\nFor a moment, I thought about going off to find it, to see what my landfill of regrets might look like at age fifteen\u2014probably all would-be girlfriends, ripe warm bodies I would never, ever touch\u2014but in an act of entirely sensible cowardice, I decided that no, it would be better to simply retreat.\nI skidded down, my tennis shoes smushing the band members\u2019 faces with every step, and I caught Robbie peering at me from the inside cover of Throw the Dice. He blinked. He smiled. A breeze ruffled his hair.\n\u201cTa, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for taking the tour.\u201d\nI fled up the stairs, slammed the storm cellar doors, and half-jogged back to the man in the plum-colored shirt. He looked up at my approach, rose from his seat, brushed some crumbs from his shirt\u2014he\u2019d been nibbling biscotti\u2014and grinned broadly.\n\u201cPara ti, amigo, hay una destinaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s. Zona Uno.\u201d He pointed in the direction I was now headed. \u201cIt\u2019s not so far. Tempted?\u201d\nNo.\nYes.\nMaybe tomorrow.\nI said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Is this your, I don\u2019t know, your job?\u201d\nThe man smiled as if his mind were unspooling through the ten billion choices that had led him here, to this awkward moment, and he ran one hand back through his sweaty hair. \u201cI\u2019m new in this country,\u201d he said, \u201cI take the work I can get. It\u2019s better than\u2014how do you say? Laying carpet.\u201d\nRobbie and I were the only people in the shop.\nI asked him for help finding a forty-five called \u201cThings Get a Little Easier.\u201d I think Robbie enjoyed the hunt: fingering sleeve after sleeve after almost identical sleeve. His fingertips and mine both came away coated in a grimy papery dust\u2014whitish, sun-bleached, dry as the death of dreams.\nRobbie rang up the sale and said, as I headed out the door, \u201cCheers, mate.\u201d\nAnd that was it.\nAfterward, I cried for weeks, helplessly, day after day, in all the wrong places: gym class, the cafeteria, at dinner with my parents. Teenage boys aren\u2019t allowed to cry, so really, every place was wrong. Allowable or not, the taps would not turn off.\nI like to picture Robbie crying, too, but maybe he didn\u2019t. He was a grown-up, after all\u2014thirty-seven\u2014and now that I\u2019m grown, I have made at least one ugly discovery: it\u2019s always easiest to weep for someone else.\nMark Rigney, who may be found at www.markrigney.net, is the author of numerous plays, including Acts of God, Bears, and Ten Red Kings.

Tyrrell","hostname":"betwixtmagazine.com","date":"2013-01-01","categories":"","tags":"","id":null,"license":null,"comments":null,"text":"It\u2019s the crack of dawn; the yolk has spilled behind the long desert horizon, and the whites spread out across the sky, beginning to cook. You pull your truck up underneath this island, a chunk of land that floats in the sky like some kind of natural dirigible, tethered to the ground by a spun-cable guy-wire as big as a gnarled oak. You\u2019ve seen it\u2014it and its brethren\u2014a thousand times, and still it takes your breath away.\nIt\u2019s already hot. Your wife would insist on sunscreen; you can hear her barked sigh from here: \u201cWhat if you get a melanoma? Then where are we?\u201d But if you were going to get skin cancer, you would have gotten it by now; you\u2019ve been doing this for the last five years\u2014ever since the last guy disappeared\u2014and before that you did construction for something like twenty? Most of your life. Though you might want to leave your windows cracked, at least, even if those are rain clouds that dot the horizon. This shouldn\u2019t take much time. This island isn\u2019t big. And it\u2019s one of the easier ones; besides being little, it\u2019s within the main cluster, a little lower than some\u2014only about fifteen feet\u2014so the wind doesn\u2019t hit quite as hard. Though if it rains, things could get soupy. It\u2019s all topsoil up there. And you forgot your gloves.\nAnd you only brought the small ladder\u2014the one you use for the lowest islands, the ones that are tethered at around ten feet. Why some are higher and some lower, you don\u2019t know. Maybe it has something to do with function: the storage islands are leashed up around fifty feet, and then the residentials at about thirty, and then the agricultural, spanning the gap between ten and twenty.\nThankfully, the ladder\u2019s ten-foot, and an A-frame that you can just leave up all day. The tether will keep the island steady enough. There\u2019s still some give; occasionally you find a ladder canted at a bizarre angle at end-of-day, especially on the bigger islands\u2014some of the larger residentials, and the storage islands, which hang blockily in the air like small warehouses caught daydreaming. There\u2019s a rope ladder up top, too, but it\u2019s hidden in a hatch off the side, always so hard to find. More of an emergency thing really. You might as well hang off the edge until you find your A-frame with your feet, pray you don\u2019t collapse it. There\u2019s a theory as to what happened to the last guy, the ones before him: their ladders closed on them, broke their necks\u2014or worse, limbs, backs, leaving them alive as the sand slowly covered them over. It took almost a year for the brass to notice your predecessor was gone. All the valves had to be overhauled. One island got so low you could almost climb up onto it from the ground.\nBut no point worrying. With any luck, you\u2019ll be off this rock by noon. And, worst case scenario, a seven-foot drop won\u2019t kill you. Come on. Up you go. Daylight\u2019s wasting.\n* * *\nFrom the top of your ladder, you can just see the surface of the island, with its meticulous topsoil rows (which remind you, oddly enough, of a prim little grandmother, hands patiently folded). It seems like the easiest way to do this is to press your hands onto this mottled plastic exterior shelf and just haul yourself . . . get your knees up . . . c\u2019mon, push . . . are you even . . . there.\nThat was tougher than you thought, wasn\u2019t it? Take a minute, catch your breath. When you\u2019re ready. Look: there\u2019s the topsoil grandmother; the work shed (patient like a Sphinx); the chains floating up into the sky, suspended by the hot air balloons that float these islands. The balloons are only half full; obviously\u2014like lungs or airplane oxygen bags\u2014they don\u2019t need to inflate fully, though it\u2019s always bothered you in a small way. Once, another maintenance man (a friend of yours by the name of Terry) opened up all the valves on one side of one of the residentials, and the balloons filled like blueberries grown ripe and juicy under the summer sun. You\u2019d only just gotten that sorted out in time, before the whole thing tipped. Terry was long gone, the only real evidence of his presence the telltale boot prints in the flowerbeds.\nThe work shed is a mess; the tools lie in clusters, off their hooks and tangled into a nest, as if sometimes, when no one\u2019s looking, these islands flip on their backs like cats trying to scratch an itch they can\u2019t reach. Though obviously not that\u2014all the dirt would fall off. There\u2019s the garden rake. It\u2019s always good to straighten up a bit before you work, at least all the stuff you have to look at. Helps with concentration. The rows usually take about an hour to rake, and then you should do a once-over of the island, check the chains for wear, and then there\u2019s\u2014\nThere\u2019s a man between the rows. An old man, cross-legged, sitting like he should have a stick to poke a fire that\u2019s not there. Or a beer. Some Cajun in a story by Mark Twain. He\u2019s completely naked; dirty, coarse white hair grows over his tan, sunken chest and belly like crops left to die on a dry and dusty field. Even with all the effort it took you getting up here, he\u2019s not looking. You clear your throat, to get his attention, or maybe because now you notice yourself\u2014your physical being, your cluttered, dusty phlegminess.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d you say, but he doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t even react to the sound of your voice. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d you say again, letting a little peevishness slip in, like he\u2019s inconveniencing you. And he is. Now you\u2019re going to have to call somebody, file a report, move him, or else have to work around\u2014\nUnless this is some sort of test, some sort of critical thinking thing. Like you\u2019re supposed to deal with him, or not deal with him. Is that what this is? But why would they test you after all this time?\nAre they trying to get rid of you?\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\nHe still won\u2019t look. He could be the most realistic statue you\u2019ve ever seen. A monument, like the islands. Nobody lives up here. The birds avoid them, like they know something, and the land animals ignore them. Nothing grows, though some of them (like this one) were designed for it. They\u2019re just examples of what could have been: bladeless wind turbines, abandoned for a lack of interest in clean energy; children with their parents\u2019 trophies, uncalled on for show-and-tell. This naked man, just a joke someone\u2019s playing.\nWho? Terry? He\u2019s next in line. He\u2019s tried things before: once he stole all your ladders. Which hadn\u2019t turned out to be a very good plan because (A) ladders are relatively cheap, and (B) he left his telltale boot print in white paint on your garage floor. He must have spilled it as he tried to maneuver the ladders out. You see him in your mind\u2019s eye, sitting at home, watching television, one hand on the phone just waiting for that call. His boots already on. It seems like a bad system, doesn\u2019t it? Only one active maintenance man, and his compatriots gunning to do him in?\n\u201cDid Terry send you?\u201d\nNothing. The man hasn\u2019t moved at all. He doesn\u2019t even really seem to be listening. Stomp over there, try startling a response out of him. The topsoil mutes everything: your footfalls are like bags of wind hitting the underside of a zeppelin. You\u2019re right beside him, and still he hasn\u2019t looked. Hasn\u2019t even flinched. Maybe he is a statue.\nBut he\u2019s soft when you kick him. He grunts, falls over. Curls into a ball. Shit. That makes you feel bad. You should apologize.\n\u201cWell, you should answer when somebody\u2019s talking to you,\u201d you say instead.\nHe still doesn\u2019t answer, lies all balled up, his eyes squeezed shut.\nThere are no boot prints up here except for yours.\n* * *\nHe just lies there, wrapped around himself like he\u2019s expecting a for-real beating. Like all he knows is sitting and getting kicked; you\u2019re teaching him about the world. A real Doctor Frankenstein you are. Maybe you should pick the man up, brush him off, touch him gently, teach him also about kindness, about friendship.\nMaybe you should call somebody.\nBut maybe this is the test. If you call, they might think you\u2019re a quitter.\nIf you don\u2019t call, they might think you\u2019re stubborn, unwilling to work with others.\nYou call home.\n\u201cDo your job,\u201d your wife says, not really listening. \u201cWhy do you call so early? I was asleep. I need my rest. I\u2019ve got things to do today.\u201d\nShe\u2019s a corporate lawyer; she has some case she\u2019s working on, something about a corporation\u2019s rights. You don\u2019t understand most of what she does. Though it could be your daughter who answered. What would she have to do today?\nThe yolk of the sun has already hardened and traveled fully into view. It\u2019s after six. There\u2019s at least eight hours of work up here to do. But if you get started now, you\u2019re still good for early afternoon. If you just ignore him. Look\u2014he could still be a monument, a truer one: Man Returns to the Womb\u2014of Nature! Man Sprouts and Dies as a Fallen Stalk of Corn. It\u2019s a metaphor, for manhood! For humanity!\nThis would probably be the test\u2014not to fall victim to the trap of the old man. Not to fall prey to distraction. Do your work; move to the next island. Maybe next time you come through here, something different will be kneeling between the rows. Maybe a beautiful young girl, your daughter\u2019s age, naked like this man is naked. Something to look at while you work. Maybe some piece of abstraction that you can ponder. Even this old man serves as a way to occupy yourself, his saggy butt the only part of him in view from where you stand, raking these rows back into their proper order. This is a good job\u2014decent pay, benefits. No one comes to check on you. No one bothers you. No one comes out here. This field is separated from the city by a hundred miles of desert\u2014your commute is about an hour and a half both ways\u2014and a fence that spans the whole site with big \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs every two hundred feet. Even the city kids, so into exploring abandoned sites\u2014malls and grocery stores, tunnels and the like\u2014are bored with this place: all the B&Es and graffiti happened years ago, long before you or your predecessor, or his predecessor, or his. The only reason anyone found out about your predecessor\u2014the only reason these islands aren\u2019t crouched on the desert floor like precarious boulders, so many beached and abandoned pontoons\u2014is because someone drove through on a lark. Some technician, some would-be maintenance man, some sightseer, some looky-loo.\nWhich is to say, there\u2019s not a lot going on out here: just you and these islands for hundreds of miles. And the work is pretty rote: sweep this, patch that, crank this, polish that. Once you\u2019ve done one, as they say, you\u2019ve done them all. But even then, each island is its own island, each day a new day. From this standpoint, you\u2019ve already maintained over a thousand islands, each new, each exactly the same. Which is to say, it gets boring, tedious, these tasks menial. Your thinking gets pretty repetitive: lunch (tuna sandwich, a bag of carrot sticks in a paper bag in the truck, but who knows if you\u2019ll\u2014), dinner (last week\u2019s tuna casserole should probably get eaten, but it\u2019d be nice if\u2014), upcoming break time (there might be some pretzels\u2014), why your wife is angry (did you forget some task, some\u2014), why your daughter won\u2019t speak to you (though how many years has it been since you really talked\u2014), why it only seems to get hotter out here, why the sun seems brighter some times than others, why the colors seem so much more dramatic at rise-and-set, why the stars\u2014when you stay so late\u2014open up in such a way as to say, look, there is more to the universe than these fifty-some floating islands (initially almost seventy) in this man-made desert at the edge of a world on fire.\nWhich is to say, it\u2019s nice to have a distraction, something to study, to look at with an artist\u2019s eye\u2014as if you\u2019re crouched in front of a canvas, grasping a piece of charcoal, instead of digging for valve-control-panel with trowel. The sun is climbing toward its apex. See: even now, the day is passing more quickly. It\u2019s already mid-morning; by the sun (you don\u2019t have a watch, and don\u2019t care to pull out your phone), about three hours have passed, and you\u2019ve still got maybe six hours of work left. You still have to check the control panel\u2014which somehow you\u2019ve missed completely in your digging\u2014test the dials, type in commands and see how fast things respond. Then there\u2019re the valves themselves, then a once-over of the balloons. After all that, you\u2019ve got to reorganize the tool shed, and then there\u2019s the cleaning of all the artificial bits. And then a final perimeter sweep, taking note of all the new wear and tear.\nAnd then you have to find your ladder. You\u2019d think that would be easy, this island only twenty or so meters across. But you always end up wandering the edge for fifteen, twenty minutes\u2014half an hour sometimes\u2014before you spot the corner of your truck, find the top rung propped against the plastic like just an extra piece of island. You should paint your ladders bright red so you can see them from a distance. And paint the hatches where the rope ladders reside, maybe repackage them in protruding boxes so you can see them from anywhere. Not that that\u2019ll ever happen; when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re working, and when you\u2019re home, you\u2019re not thinking about ladders. Chances are, you\u2019re thinking about the islands, all of them floating through your head like a sown field, these elephants the crops that will grow if only someone would let them, if only someone could figure out the proper maintenance. The dream: to find, beyond your trained, rote actions some magic, some inventiveness, some spell that would allow these islands to reach some further potential, to grow into being, to become whatever it is they yearn to become. You\u2019ve tried planting a couple things\u2014mostly on the residentials early on when you were trying to live in one of those McMansions, before your wife put her foot down. Lilies, roses, hydrangea\u2014hearty flowers that could take anywhere\u2014but nothing ever grew. You\u2019ve thought about trying on one of the agriculturals, like here, where the soil seems designed for it, dotted with flecks of fertilizer, heavy with moistness, a loaminess to it. Maybe some corn, or beans, or. . . .\nAnd then your wife is yelling about how you never pay attention or do the things she asks; you live on an island inside your head, one that she can\u2019t reach, that you don\u2019t want her on, or even around. Now she\u2019s stomping out of rooms and slamming doors, or if not that, then she\u2019s staring icily, or if not staring, then not staring, just as icily.\nAnd now your daughter\u2019s asking what the hell your problem is, and she is storming out of rooms, always, the book she was reading or writing in hanging from her fingers, her phone clutched in her hand like she might throw it, and only doesn\u2019t because it would be your head she threw it at.\nYou\u2019ve dug down deep enough now to find cables and wires running under the dirt, which you\u2019re not supposed to do, not supposed to be able. They seem a bit science fiction\u2014blue and chrome, veins, tendons, ligaments, connecting the musculature that flexes and pulls under the soil. They seem to pulse, faintly, with something like a . . . heartbeat?\nCover them over. They don\u2019t matter. Listen, you\u2019re falling behind. You need to try to fall back, at least, into your learned rhythm. Let your body do the work while your mind wanders.\n* * *\nThe immediate problem being: there\u2019s an old, naked man lying between the rows, clutching himself, prepared for the other shoe to drop. If it was just the island, any normal island, you would have no problem daydreaming the day away while the work was done by your hands as if by some preprogrammed machine. Which is exactly what happened: your hands and shoulders and eyes and feet were wired together at maintenance school. All you do is set them in motion, and the mechanics take over, run as they were designed, spurred on by the short horizon all around, the flatness, the singular tool shed in the middle of it all.\nBut not with this man in the midst. Every time your eyes wander across him, you come out of it, and there you are, holding some tool, in the middle of an action you can only barely remember how to restart.\nMaybe what you need is to call someone who can understand, who can empathize. Not your family. But still not the Office; the test could very well be overcoming this obstacle on your own without having to ask for help. And sure, Terry is your replacement, and could very well be angling for your downfall, but he\u2019s also your friend. He\u2019d drive you crazy, sure, but he wouldn\u2019t report you. You were roommates, for Chrissakes. You got through training together.\n\u201cA man, huh?\u201d he says over the phone. \u201cRight there between the rows?\u201d You see, in your mind\u2019s eye, his face squinching in thought, the slow, belabored shaking of the head, like the weight of the world rests on this very question. There is silence for a moment as Terry travels to a distant star. It\u2019s a desired trait for the maintenance men: the ability to disappear from this world in order to travel through to the next.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, catching you in the middle of your own journey, \u201cwhat about the old guy?\u201d\nThe old guy?\n\u201cThe other guy. The one you replaced.\u201d\nWhat about him?\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he disappear?\u201d\nWell, yeah. What of it?\n\u201cCould this not be. . . .\u201d\nBut don\u2019t a lot of people disappear? Don\u2019t, in point of fact, most maintenance men who didn\u2019t quit spectacularly just, well, fade out?\n\u201cBut it could be, right? I mean, who else could it be?\u201d\nWho else could it be?\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say, and though the man still doesn\u2019t respond, doesn\u2019t move even, there\u2019s something . . . well, familiar there. You all went through the program together: you, the maintenance men. It just seems like maybe . . . yes, maybe you remember something. A snapshot of a man who was not this old\u2014though time has passed, you\u2019re all older\u2014in an exercise you had to do, one of the emergency drills, something about three or more balloons failing while a maintenance man was still on an island. He turns to say something\u2014\n\u201cBut wait, they found him, right? Out in the desert, dry and crispy.\u201d\nDid they? You don\u2019t remember that. In your memory, the guy just vanished like all the rest, one day out of hundreds just disappeared. Shit, the only way you know he existed at all is that these islands are still here, and that one weird memory in the middle of a drill when he turned to you, his leathery face pulled into a grin, and said\u2014\nWhat did he say?\n* * *\nMaintenance school was long after college, long after you\u2019d established yourself as an electrician, worked for a fairly sizable firm that contracted out all sorts of construction work. You were reasonably respected in your industry, and maybe that\u2019s why they recruited you. They were looking, as they told you, for experts. People who were the best in their fields. That was flattering, though probably untrue. They only pulled from the area. And the training was . . . less than spectacular.\nIt consisted of three months of seminars, What-If-This-Happened sessions, group discussions about various worries, thoughts, impressions\u2014as if the program was so new (it was) they hadn\u2019t had time (probably not) or the experience (that either) to come up with anything more than \u201csit in a circle and tell us what we should do.\u201d A couple drills, rote repetition designed to focus your instincts, establish a kind of muscle memory, but even those delivered hesitantly, the trainers\u2014greying men in lab coats\u2014reckless in their confusion, with their incoherent visions of the future. So little of the program devoted to instruction, so little of it delivered with any tone reminiscent of authoritative, confident, competent, so that when you all graduated in a neat little certification-handing-out ceremony, it was with winks and barely concealed smirks all around. And when you finally got out here, some ten years later without so much as a refresher, it was your electrician\u2019s training, your engineering schooling you survived on, until the drills finally came back like some form of hypnosis buried from childhood, designed to take over not at some word or experience but at that pure instance of comfort. Only when you no longer had to think about what you were doing did you finish a day and realize you had done things differently, and that these new things seemed strangely familiar: a resonance, an odd ritual, these things done less for function than in deference to some ancient, metallic God of the Sky.\nTerry was there, of course, and your predecessor, and his, and his, and so on, and the manufacturers, and the bureaucrats, and even the Company President, the CEO, a few members of the Board. This was back when these elephants were New, The Future, Important. Every night, your wife asking about the job\u2014how exciting, her husband, the Trailblazer. No resentment yet, just wide-eyed youth; the young couple, a step up in the world.\nAfter fifteen years, the only evidence that anybody still cares is the phone call you received five years ago, and the automatic deposit that hits your and your wife\u2019s joint account on the first and fifteenth of each month. You rarely talk to the Office. For all you know, all those smiling men are gone, on to bigger (maybe) and better (probably not) things, and the whole of this is run by uninformed machines in buildings that haven\u2019t seen human habitation since the company nearly went bankrupt almost ten years ago. You\u2019ve been in there, back before it went global. You\u2019ve seen the rooms upon rooms of monitors hooked to cameras aimed\u2014you can only imagine\u2014at every conceivable angle of each island: a hellish wet dream of surveillance professionals and voyeurs, with the little wheely chairs you could\u2014at the time\u2014see filled with butt-digging middle Americans. But you can see them empty just as easily. Hell, if it weren\u2019t for your wife and daughter\u2014whom you see pretty much daily after work\u2014and their stories of friends and neighbors and random people in random places, it would be easy to think, out here by yourself, that the only things out there are machines: at some point, when you weren\u2019t looking\u2014maybe while you were at work one day\u2014humanity just wiped itself out. You\u2019re the last one, and everyone you call is a series of blips and bloops recorded years ago and manipulated to sound like they actually care. Every physical interaction is a planted memory. You\u2019re the subject of some bizarre experiment performed by half-sentient robots who have no clue about desired outcomes or reasons for testing, as they\u2019re just clueless, half-cocked bureaucrats themselves. The only one who could have knowledge of an endpoint is you, you who were a product of something outside of this project, something outside of the purview of any machine, you the last human.\nWell. You and this naked guy.\nThe point being, you were all together, all the maintenance men, you and twenty-eight other guys, hired in one push to get ready for the boom, these brilliant floating islands that would Change Everything: the way humanity Did Business, the way humanity Traveled, Lived, and Died. Soon, fossil fuels would be a thing of the past, as would overpopulation. Soon, islands would float across every sky. Sure, there was the worry that the ever-widening gap between rich and poor would be further widened, but had that ever stopped anybody? And think of the jobs that would come out of this, millions and billions of islands to build and maintain and work. And these twenty-nine men were the beginning of that workforce, the beginning of the beginning of a new world.\nThe point being, there was a camaraderie there, built on excitement and winking and chuckling at the ineptitude of superiors and after-work beers and shared grievances. Family picnics, your daughter out playing with your compatriots\u2019 kids. A tiny spitfire, so curious, always toppling things, displacing them, breaking them open to see what\u2019s inside. Torture to be away from her, but: the opportunity! Every little thing you missed, every irrevocable bit (and you know the other guys feel this way, too), was a sacrifice to the great machine of progress. That\u2019s how progress works. You have to give of yourself. You have to give yourself.\nIt\u2019s how you and Terry met, and he\u2019s the best friend you\u2019ve ever had. And sure, all the rest of you fell out of touch, haven\u2019t spoken in years, but still you can remember them; you felt it when each one quit, or disappeared, vanishing as the islands themselves vanish every once in a while, leaving their tethers curled on the desert floor like discarded snakeskins, used condoms, while the islands ascend somewhere out of reach. It was like losing a part of your family, knowing that complete disconnect. Knowing that they were gone forever.\nAnd that\u2019s why this guy couldn\u2019t be your predecessor. Because you don\u2019t remember him. Do you? When you look at him, you feel nothing. Right? He\u2019s a stranger, though he brings this vision. He\u2019s human, so sure, you feel the pity, the sympathetic ache, the frustration that comes when you see a man down on his luck and not doing anything about it. No one likes to see somebody down on their luck. Or you don\u2019t, at least. No, this is no one you know. Not at all.\n* * *\nIt just seems important, is all, what he said in that ancient drill a million years ago. Was it some kind of message, implanted in your brain like the rest of your training? Perhaps cooked up by an early form of resistance, a small group of forward-thinking individuals that recognized the possibility of just such a machine uprising and so set into motion fifteen years ago a plan that would culminate in a naked man with no capacity for communication being dumped on this one island on this one day, which would, eventually, result in a call to Terry (who may or may not be involved) who would trigger a vision of a half-remembered comment made by a man (deliberately?) vanished some five years previous, not even really close to any anniversary of any such event?\nThe naked man lies here between the rows, his ribs showing. His flesh more like a light blanket that pools, yes, here and there, but covers nothing, really: some old bones, a stale breath or two, an eye that might have once brushed against the oily membrane of the world. If you touched him (you still haven\u2019t actually touched him) he\u2019d be cold. It makes sense: he\u2019s naked; there\u2019s altitude (a little); he\u2019s paper on cardboard; he\u2019s folded himself up, as if trying to shield what little fire there is left. He\u2019s so still. Is he breathing?\n\u201cIs he breathing?\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t even realize you still had the phone pressed to your ear. How much did you say? You suddenly feel foolish, embarrassed like a boy in play with his friends. The rule: one must never show one\u2019s insides.\nYou don\u2019t know, you say.\n\u201cWell, shouldn\u2019t you find out?\u201d\nFind out? What does that mean?\n\u201cCheck if he\u2019s breathing.\u201d\nTouch him, they say.\nYou find yourself creeping, tiptoeing, as if one errant step might set something off, some kind of (reality) bomb, that might swallow the whole . . . island, or something. Ridiculous. Like that.\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say, loud, maybe by way of jolting him into . . . existence, but again he does nothing, no movement at all, not even that shiver you might have imagined from earlier when you kicked him, like you gave him, with that lesson, the thrill of something like knowledge.\nIs that a bruise there? Had that boot-toe-shaped, purplish, maybe-birthmark-looking\u2014had that always been there?\n\u201cHey,\u201d you say again, softer, \u201chey, hey,\u201d like a comfort, and you kneel there beside him, one knee sinking into the soil\u2014you can feel the wetness through your work pants\u2014and you put one hand to those ribs\u2014so thin, piano keys\u2014approach like maybe it\u2019s your wife you are touching, your daughter (gently, gently, just hovering, hovering above) you can\u2019t start this symphony without. . . .\nHe is cold.\nHe is not: breathing. His heart does not reverberate through this chest cavity like it should, like you thought it would. Those eyes: they do not stare. There is nothing in them to stare, unless it\u2019s his insides they\u2019re curious about. One final act: to try and find what has so recently gone missing.\n* * *\nYou lean against the work shed and watch him. In death, he seems more relaxed. There was a tautness to him before, like he was constricting himself, a jungle snake, confused, partaking of that personal bounty. Now, he\u2019s released. Not his bowels; his musculature. The way he lies there: you understand the poet\u2019s insistence on death as sleep. It\u2019s like, in a way, he just forgot to live. He lies down one day and forgets to rise, and so on and so forth until he can\u2019t remember at all how that even works. Days come. Days go. A breath. A heartbeat. Syncopation; a missed entrance, forgotten, lost. Is this how the symphony ends? It\u2019s not written. It\u2019s not abandoned. It\u2019s just forgotten?\nWas he dying? Was this whole thing the action of a domesticated animal, an effort to disappear back into the wilderness to live out its last? He, the old maintenance man, done in years ago by the disease all around. The disease of technology, strung out by perpetuated (forced?) life, hopping from island to island, hoping to find peace. Had he been searching for you? Were you always his desired implement of death?\nDid you kill him?\n\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d Terry has asked, and in this one moment, you wonder if this really is all Terry, he the author, the composer of it.\n\u201cWill you call the Office?\u201d he asks.\nWill you call\u2014?\nThis does seem the time. There was never life here. But now there is death.\n* * *\n\u201cThank you for calling Pharos Industries of the Future. We\u2019re currently undergoing some restructuring. In order to help you more effectively, we\u2019ve instituted a new Automated Messaging System. If at any time you\u2019d rather speak to a representative, please say, \u2018Representative.\u2019 If you have a serial number for a malfunctioning device, please press or say, \u2018One.\u2019 If you have a question about a function of a device not covered in our comprehensive device manual, please press or say, \u2018Two.\u2019 If you believe you have received the wrong device, please press or say\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRepresentative,\u201d you say.\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d and then some cloud-dotted, blue-sky music, and then another voice, this one more human, more bored, more\u2014\n\u201cThis is Janice, your Pharos Advisory Agent. How can I help you today?\u201d\n\u201cJanice,\u201d you say, tasting the word. Something\u2019s not quite right. Something. . . .\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n\u201cUh . . . Janice, I\u2019m . . . actually with the company, and I\u2019ve got a . . . a bit of a. . . .\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d\nYou don\u2019t remember a Janice, but you recognize something in that voice, that boredom, that sullenness. It sounds just like\u2014\n\u201cClaire?\u201d you say.\nSilence.\n\u201cClaire, it\u2019s your dad.\u201d\nClick.\n* * *\nThe egg whites have gone milky, so much heat pouring through them that they\u2019ve gelatinized, creating one yellow-white lambent mold from horizon to horizon. It\u2019s well after noon. It\u2019ll be dark by the time you\u2019ve finished everything. And here you are, still leaning against the work shed, wondering.\nIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s forbidden from working at the Office. But no one ever told you. It seems like a thing you\u2019re supposed to know. Right? You would have liked to know. To be kept in the loop. Left out? Is that how you feel right now? Disconnected?\nIt\u2019s home you call this time, your wife again, because there\u2019s something in you that needs to hear her voice, even if\u2014like before\u2014she just ousts you back into the desert. It\u2019s probably what you need, to be told to get off your ass and get back to work; you\u2019re supposed to be back for dinner, even if you have to half-ass it and finish this island tomorrow\u2014\nBut she doesn\u2019t answer, after the traditional five rings, or even a few more, possibly imagined, tacked on in accordance with some universal pity, in order to give her time to get to the phone. Instead, it\u2019s your voice that answers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here, and we\u2019re probably never coming back. Go ahead and leave a message, if you want. Maybe some future civilization will get a kick out of it.\u201d\nBeeeep.\nYour idea of a joke. You almost scoff. That\u2019s what your wife would do. You can see her grinding jaw, your daughter\u2019s exasperated eye roll.\nBut they left it, didn\u2019t they? What does that mean?\nYou realize you\u2019ve been breathing into the phone for half a minute.\n* * *\nHe lies out in the middle of the field like a movie death\u2014posed, it seems\u2014just as much a monolith, a monument (yes, it\u2019s true), as these islands. Thunder in the distance; the clouds that had, this morning, clung to the rim have now invaded like polyps into the egg whites, which are less and less white now, rotting down into late afternoon, as if this sky were always diseased\u2014from birth we are meant to die.\nIt\u2019s beautiful out here. Notice that, for once. The other islands float several hundred yards out, hanging in the atmospheric soup, degrees of ledges and overhangs on an extradimensional mountain, height and width and time all one\u2014competing forms of depth\u2014stretching, maybe, eventually, into the sky. The advancing clouds just another form of island. It\u2019s as if this Earth is reaching out, we humans perhaps just machines as well, cogs, microchips, invented and placed in attempt to reach the stars. Does our mother yearn to touch God? Does she desire to meet one who is similar enough to understand her, but other enough to be someone\u2014something\u2014else, not just a continuation of the self? Does she desire a greater, truer form of companionship? What is the myth? That in the dawn of time, God or creation ripped the perfect human form in two, so that each half searches eternally for its other? Would not the most satisfactory companionship reject homogenization? Would not the truly perfect companion resist assimilation?\nWould not such a companion refrain, at all costs, from connection? Would we not spend our lives reaching out in errant directions, collecting the things and people who imperfectly match, those that either disappear too easily into the whole, or improperly align so that they skitter along the edge of consciousness, rejected but forever present, sandpaper rubbing against the mind as a reminder that the true desired outcome is impossible: we will die before we sacrifice it?\nFifteen years ago, in a drill designed by half-people trying to find the part of themselves that could make this project work, a man turned to you and said something. Today, a man\u2014maybe the same man, in representation if not in form\u2014appeared on your island, refused contact, died to keep from having that connection.\nWho would survive if Earth and Sky merged? Even earth or sky?\nThe rain pelts down in the distance; you can see its shadow, a curtain that sweeps this way. Soon it will be here, and not too long after that will come night. There\u2019s still time to crawl to the edge, locate your ladder, retreat home. As you should. The dead man will even help\u2014the way he lies is a clue: remember how he knelt when you arrived, assign vectors of kick and fall, calculate angular displacement. It\u2019s a physics problem. You trained for this.\nOn the other side of the equation, the shovel still hangs from its blade on the wall in the work shed. Like Peter, it has been crucified upside down. It\u2019s a relic; no one\u2019s ever used it. You\u2019ve never needed it; the trowel was always enough. Even if something had been done with this place, it would have been someone else\u2014another hired hand, another human machine\u2014doing the real digging.\nBut in some way, shovel in hand\u2014and you\u2019re probably reading into things here, but\u2014doesn\u2019t it feel like you\u2019re fulfilling some long-neglected truth? You\u2019re living some(one else\u2019s) dream, digging this hole in this field, overturning this dirt that even now glistens with some indefinable moisture, pockmarked by the same tiny, white fertilizer-pebbles you remember from your parent\u2019s garden as a child. All the way down to the glistening wires\u2014naked silver or with blue heat casings\u2014running under the soil like maybe some sort of irrigation system.\nAnd, as you pick up this old, naked man\u2014just a husk, a seed casing\u2014and lay him down in the soil, isn\u2019t it a bit like . . . well . . . planting? Even as you fill in the hole, pat the dirt back into its row, the rain comes, fast and hard, as if called for in this moment, as if wrought in its recognition. As if from death comes life.\n* * *\nAnd now it\u2019s raining, so hard you can\u2019t see. The darkness is amazing; it came so suddenly, like the day was a lit stage and the storm a fallen curtain, its counterbalance cut so as to give the rough and hasty illusion of night. It\u2019s too late, now, to find your ladder, or to search for the rope ladder\u2019s hatch. Even if you got down, this is a monsoon. This desert hasn\u2019t seen rain like this in months. Your truck will be stuck in the muck. You\u2019ll be trapped in the cab; if it floods, you\u2019ll be swept away, drowned as your vessel\u2014not built for water\u2014capsizes.\nBut this rain comes so hard you could drown just standing here. There\u2019s barely space between the drops; your eyes, your nose, your very pores are filling with water. There\u2019s only a bit of shelter on this whole island: the work shed. Run to it now, while you\u2019re still able to run, before the soil turns semiliquid and sucks you under. Toss the tangled tools outside; they\u2019re worthless at this point anyway. Close yourself in. Come: sit, here on this shelf. Pull your knees to your chest, lean back against the wall like you did in your parents\u2019 house when you were a boy\u2014like sometimes you catch your daughter doing late at night, staring up at the moon, the stars, like maybe there\u2019s something up there worth knowing about, something to hear, to feel out in the universe that makes it all worthwhile. Close your eyes. Listen. These raindrops like shockwaves, carpet bombing, white noise: a pattern so complex as to be nothing, unknowable.\nIs there something in that, something buried?\nWhat is it?\nWhat\u2019s out there?\n* * *\nWake up.\nYou\u2019ve been sleeping for hours. Your wife will be hysterical. Your phone\u2019s dead; it must have died in the night. You need to get moving. You\u2019re a day behind already. They probably won\u2019t notice. But this is how it starts. It\u2019s just this one thing, and then there\u2019s another, and another. Work-flow halts. This is how you get fired. This is how you disappear.\nBut the door is stuck, even when you push with your shoulder, even when you ram against it; it bends, it creaks, but it doesn\u2019t budge. The mud must have mixed into a slurry, akin to concrete. Those tools must have mounded against the door, jamming it.\nDon\u2019t panic. This is a man-made object; there has to be another way out.\nSure enough, look at the floor: a hatch. Odd that you\u2019ve never noticed that; the tools must have covered it.\nBeneath the hatch is a rusty metal ladder, old, old, which falls away into darkness. Down, down. Much farther than you would have thought. Who knew the island could be so thick? You have been climbing for nearly a minute when your foot strikes floor, a material like granite, marble: smooth, slick. It\u2019s pitch black in this . . . cavern? . . . you\u2019ve found, but even as the thought flitters across your mind, a point of light opens in front of you, which flares like a flashlight in the distance, and then\u2014\nThe horizon begins to glow. The sun is rising. Something has happened to the walls; something has made them invisible. It\u2019s like they\u2019re made of glass, like they don\u2019t exist. You stand here in midair, the horizon spilling out in front of you like you\u2019re watching the birth of the world.\nThe man you buried is here as well. He\u2019s covered in topsoil, but the wires and tubes that protrude from the base of his skull and all the way down his spine, like a bird\u2019s nest of blue and chrome, plastic and metal and silicon: they are so pristine. Sterile. He\u2019s not moving, just hanging there. Is he alive? He\u2019s turned away from you, and whatever noises you must have made in the descent haven\u2019t alerted him. A part of you wants to reach out, to touch him, let him know you\u2019re here. But then the whole thing\u2014the whole island\u2014drops, like an elevator with hydraulic breaks, falls just an inch. The scene slips slowly downward, and then a jolt\u2014the tether, disengaging?\u2014and now force, movement pressing down on you, the island picking up speed, sloughing off the burden of gravity.\nAnd the islands fall, and the desert, the city in the distance chained to other cities by highways running off cliffs into the oceans. Soon, it\u2019s all one mass, congealing, slipping away; the Earth is a ball fallen from your fingertips, shrinking with each passing second. All around stars, and void.\nSuddenly, at that fleeing horizon: a pinprick, germinating, blossoming into solar flare, burst of light\u2014a timid hand, a nervous kiss brushed against the whole of creation.\nBenjamin A. Tyrrell is excited by the times. Authors like Kelly Link, Rivka Galchen, Jeff VanderMeer, and even Yiyun Li are taking the Weird to broader audiences, spreading it like seeds across a plain once thought too strange to be fertile, but which is proving to be very bountiful indeed. Benjamin is glad to spread the gospel of the Weird through publications at places like apt and Isthmus, and is happy to be involved in the glorious, genre-smashing mind-boggler that is Betwixt.

The boy knows this because he is there on a field trip when it is found. The weather that day is clear and cool. The air smells of pine and water and sand. He hikes with his class over trails, surrounded by evergreens. His grandmother would complain that the trees look sick, but in all his life the boy has never seen so much greenery. He imagines they are walking through a forest. He imagines they are visiting a garden.\nThe students and teachers eventually emerge from the treeline, follow the shore back toward the parking area. There are sounds of commotion up ahead, and rounding a bend, the class discovers that the southern half of the beach has been cordoned off. A news crew is on scene. A few police officers mill about the perimeter, and city workers wearing masks cluster around a huge dark object in the sand. Something slick and black, nearly the size of their school bus. The animals have already been at it. Gulls flap and scream rage at the workers.\n\u201cI thought they were bigger,\u201d says a girl from his class. She is tall and blonde, with hard eyes and a small, hard mouth. She has wandered up beside him, stands watching without expression. The boy is not sure what he was expecting\u2014there have been no live sightings of a wild orca in Puget Sound since before he was born. He looks past the carcass, focuses on the high-rises going up on Bainbridge Island.\n\u201cMaybe the others are bigger,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe this one was just a baby.\u201d\n\u201cThen why was it alone?\u201d\n* * *\nThe bus ride home is quiet. Hardly anyone speaks. A few of the other students hazard inappropriate jokes, but even those have lost their appeal. The chaperones look outside, and somewhere in the back a child cries quietly. The boy listens but can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a boy or a girl. He supposes it doesn\u2019t matter.\nHe goes home, finds his grandmother at the kitchen table. In the air above it hovers a projection, thin as glass, showing the orca\u2019s remains. The picture has a grainy, zoomed-in quality. Lines of news-text scroll by underneath. The old woman looks up, sees him in the doorway, asks him, \u201cYou saw this?\u201d\nHe gives a small nod. He has a sense that his grandmother, like many of his teachers, has been shaken deeply, but he doesn\u2019t know how to respond. \u201cThe teachers tried to talk about it, when we got back to school.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you last see one?\u201d she asks. \u201cI think it was on the ferries. We must have been twenty-five, twenty-six, do you remember? We must have just gotten married.\u201d\nThe boy shakes his head. He is only ten years old. He says, \u201cGrama, no.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember that word they had for it? From our trip to India the one time? Samsara. One thing passing into another. Not so terrible really, just sad is all.\u201d She goes back to the image of the carcass onscreen, and her eyes take a faraway look. When a moment has passed she spies him watching her. \u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d\nHe frowns. \u201cGrama, you were just talking.\u201d\n\u201cNo I wasn\u2019t.\u201d She laughs, and a brief shadow crosses her face. She pauses, frowns, rubs at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go lie down for a bit.\u201d\n* * *\nLater, after she is asleep, the boy fixes dinner, eats at the table in silence. Afterward, he goes out and sits on their balcony. The boy and his grandmother live on the eighth floor of a housing project near SafeCo Field; he has lived there with her since his parents died in the eruption. In the summertime, the view through the blinds is of other apartments, the endless rooftops with their solar panels and tangled power lines. The distant stadium with its floodlights. The evening light is fading to gold, and the skyline is a mass of conflicting architectures, fluorescent mosaics. The night air, a wall of horns and angry traffic. The boy imagines the scene as a painting, wonders what it would be like without all the people in it.\nThis is not the first time his grandmother has spoken this way. She has always been a dreamer, in love with her sculpting and her books. She has always been immersed in her fancies, but it\u2019s been more often lately, and been getting worse. Now she mistakes him for other people, or forgets basic details\u2014the day\u2019s date, the location of her keys, how many times she has asked him about his homework. The boy is frightened. He has no one else. He has lived long enough to know what happens to those who have no one else.\nHe glances over the balcony railing. The streets below are a crush of pedestrians, pedicabs, the occasional car. Street vendors work over grills, shout out in English, Tagalog, Japanese. Even from here he can smell the steam, the cooking meat. He watches the crowds, wonders what will happen when his grandmother cannot care for either of them. Will he end up in foster, or be sold into juvie? Will he end up as one of the street kids? No one knows what happens to the street kids. No one cares what happens to the street kids.\nHe spies a familiar figure among the crowd, a tall girl with blonde hair. Outside of school she wears a heavy black jacket, too warm for summer and two sizes too large. She cuts through the crowd, guarding a large black bag. He shouts down to her, but she doesn\u2019t hear. Her attention is elsewhere, and he watches her as she goes.\n* * *\nHe finds her at recess the following day. She hides from the sun beneath the bleachers, hunches over a notebook. The city sizzles in the distance beyond the chain-link. He sits down beside her, says, \u201cI saw you yesterday.\u201d When she doesn\u2019t respond, he tries a different tack. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\n\u201cDefine \u2018live.\u2019\u201d She frowns over her sketch, bears down with her marker. She answers finally, \u201cYesler.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m up on Sixth,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat were you doing out by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI just go,\u201d she says. \u201cAround. Mostly I walk. Sometimes I take the train.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about my parents?\u201d she asks. \u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t care, and my mom\u2019s not around to say anything.\u201d The boy frowns. He used to envy that level of freedom\u2014to be able to go and do as one might wish. Then one day his parents dropped him off at school, and Mount Rainier woke up, and no one came back to get him. He changes the subject.\n\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I just want to see.\u201d\n\u201cI told you already: don\u2019t.\u201d Her voice is like a cold, clear stream. She fixes him with harsh green eyes, reminds him of the cats that stalk the alleys beneath his window. Thin and wary, faces upturned toward the sun. He lets the matter drop, and she goes back to her work.\nLater on in class, her messenger bag is open beneath her desk. Her notebook peeks out from inside it. On the top page is a drawing of a black shape, an orca, rendered in thick black lines. Like the old tribal carvings, he thinks, but instead of white eyespots or ivory flanks, one can only see the bones.\n* * *\nHe comes home to find his grandmother sitting at the living-room window. It is a bright day, hazy with smog. She cradles a glass of water on her knee, looks down on the streets below. She has always worn her gray hair long, pinned back with a turquoise barrette. In the light from outside she looks almost young. She sees him and smiles, turns her gaze back outside. \u201cHello, sweetheart.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t reply. He removes his bag, approaches the window slowly. The view across the street is of other buildings, decrepit signs, the massive el track above their neighborhood. The el carries bullet trains into and out of Seattle, up through Vancouver and farther on up to Anchorage. To the south, the routes all go out to Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles. The track\u2019s maglevs hum at all hours, and they grow louder whenever a train is coming. They grow louder now, and he can feel their charge upon the air. That old smell, like dust on a hot stove.\n\u201cReminds me of cicadas,\u201d she says. \u201cBack when I was your age. You used to hear them singing in the trees.\u201d The boy has never heard a cicada. He doubts that such music could ever rise to roar the way the trains do\u2014the way that one does now, shaking the walls, thundering the floors, snapping the breeze outside like so many prayer flags. The pictures on the wall all rattle, and the boy counts the roar of each passing car. He makes it to twenty and then the sound is gone again. He feels his arm hairs prickling with static. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they ever stop here?\u201d he asks. \u201cLike the commuter lines?\u201d\nThe old woman looks at him. \u201cSweetheart, those kinds of trains, they don\u2019t build stations here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cYou know, I wanted to move out here for years,\u201d she says. \u201cTo the west side. Your grandfather refused to go. We fought about it\u2014I tried to make him see, told him he\u2019d work himself into the grave, trying to keep that farm alive. Then one day he was out in the barn, trying to change a prop blade on one of the drones. I was at the window and I watched him stand up, wipe his forehead, take two steps toward the house, and fall right over. Neat as you please.\u201d She never once meets his gaze, never once lets her sad smile fade. He wishes that he could have known her when she was younger, if they might have grown up as friends. It seems wrong to keep her in a place like this, like watching a flower die in a vase. For the first time since his parents\u2019 funerals, he finds it hard to swallow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI know I\u2019m losing things,\u201d she says. \u201cI know I\u2019m going away. I\u2019m trying, though.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to be big for me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the time comes. You have to be a big boy. Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t be afraid, just call 911.\u201d She looks at her hands a moment. Says, \u201cI\u2019m scared, sweetheart. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. What will happen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have to promise me,\u201d she tells him. \u201cShe\u2019s just a little girl. She\u2019ll be scared. She won\u2019t understand where her mother\u2019s gone.\u201d She goes then to pull him in close, and he lets her. He says nothing as she strokes his hair, as she tries not to cry. He is strong for her, the way she has asked of him. He does not speak, only focuses hard upon his breathing.\n* * *\nThe next day his grandmother has gotten worse. He finds her sitting on the edge of her bed, back bent, both feet planted. She grips the mattress, stares hard at the floor when the boy peeks in. She presses her lips together, shakes her head, and says, \u201cI can\u2019t go. Please don\u2019t make me go.\u201d The boy says nothing. She has realized that she is losing this battle for good. She will not be leaving the apartment today.\nHe keeps to himself at school that day, keeps his head down, takes lunch alone in the classroom. He avoids his teacher\u2019s attempts to talk both before and after class, later sits against the wall outside the band room until the buses have gone. He is still there when the girl comes in from the schoolyard. She pauses when she sees him, asks him, \u201cYou waiting for your ride?\u201d\nHe shrugs. Right now his grandmother is probably sitting at the table, he thinks\u2014perhaps watching the feeds, perhaps staring off into space. He wonders where she goes during her episodes, thinks that he should head home, tells himself she probably needs him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d he says.\nThe girl frowns, glances toward the doors. Something in her face hardens. She turns as if to go and then stops. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Come on.\u201d\nThey set off, and the girl dons her sun-goggles, adjusts her great heavy bag. \u201cDon\u2019t get me pinched,\u201d she says. They cross a street, take a right, take another right, and soon pass beneath the Chinese gate of the old International District. The streets are a mass of faces\u2014black, white, brown. Delivery trucks blare horns as they inch through the mobs. Aerial drones run parcels and direct traffic, while people beg on every street corner. An airliner roars in overhead.\nThe girl asks, \u201cSo what are you avoiding?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Then he remembers their conversation. \u201cOh. My grama.\u201d\n\u201cLike what, does she hit you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s just gone a lot.\u201d Some lies only reveal themselves as truths once we speak them. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d She doesn\u2019t respond. They keep walking, and the boy takes note of the heat, wishes he had used the drinking fountain before they set out. He shouts through the crowds, \u201cI\u2019m thirsty.\u201d\nThe girl glances back over her shoulder, but otherwise says nothing. At first, he doesn\u2019t think she has heard him. Then she collides with a pack of gangbangers in kimono and vintage tracksuits\u2014they shout curses and finger their swords, but she bows an apology and continues walking. They mutter and go back to their smokes, but eye the boy up as he passes.\nHe finds her with her head down, busy rifling through a wallet she didn\u2019t have before. She fishes out a clutch of metallic green notes, drops the rest, shoves the money into her coat. \u201cCome on.\u201d They slip into a convenience store, beeline for the cold drinks in the back. She stops at a wall of sodas, grabs a bottle of the green apple. Asks him, \u201cWhat did you want?\u201d\nHe looks at the bright displays, feels the pale, cold light against his skin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cJust pick,\u201d she says. \u201cOr I\u2019m picking for you.\u201d After a moment she grabs another green-apple soda, marches up to the counter, plays polite with the Russian man working the till. She says good and yes, please and thank you, shoots the boy a look as she hands over her money. She grabs the bag containing their spoils and wanders outside, walks out into the street, out to the sculpture in the middle of the roundabout. She clambers onto the pedestal, produces their sodas, along with two granola bars that he didn\u2019t see her take. She hands one to him and opens her soda, palms the cap and takes a long, hard pull.\nHe asks her, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe wipes her mouth. \u201cYou said you were thirsty. What?\u201d\nThe boy frowns, wrestles with the implications. It is stealing\u2014he knows this. It is also the first nice thing that anyone from school has ever done for him. He mumbles a \u201cThank you,\u201d twists off his cap, and takes a long slow drink. He savors the cold and the sweet, savors the bubbles on his tongue.\n\u201cYou take what you need,\u201d she says, \u201cbut you share what you have.\u201d\n* * *\nThey sit and tuck into their granola bars, wash them down with swigs of their beverages. He asks her after a time, \u201cWho said that earlier? About the sharing?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom.\u201d\n\u201cIs she still\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cCome on.\u201d They climb down off the sculpture, wander north in the direction of downtown. The buildings grow taller, older, and people line up at every bus stop. College kids hiding behind sunglasses and earsets; middle-aged mothers with their purses, waiting to go to night classes or to second jobs.\nThey come up to a crowded intersection. The girl steals again as they cross the street, from a man busy arguing on a call. She nudges past him, keeps walking, and in the crush of bodies it\u2019s just one more gentle brush. One more checked elbow.\n\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d he asks. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d\n\u201cHim and his friends drink a lot of beer,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really even looks at the checking anymore.\u201d She slows as they pass a poster selling luxury condos, pass a construction site sealed off by chain-link fences and plywood. Steel girders loom above them, and a crane hauls supplies to the upper levels. Workers move through the dust and the noise, wearing blue coveralls and masks. Many wear orange turbans. All wear barcodes.\n\u201cI saw your notebook the other day,\u201d he says. \u201cIn class. Your bag was open.\u201d\n\u201cSo? Who cares\u201d\n\u201cThe orca thing really bothered you too,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cQuit being a puss.\u201d They walk faster, and the sun dips behind the taller skyscrapers. The streets around them fall into shadow.\n* * *\nAt some point, she says, \u201cCop car, go left,\u201d and they slip into an alleyway. They wind past two emergency exits and a fire escape before coming into a large courtyard. Trucks and platforms and dumpsters everywhere\u2014a loading zone. Department store logos cover everything.\n\u201cThey throw tons of crap away in places like this,\u201d she says. \u201cPull lookout.\u201d She throws back the first of the lids, and the boy glances back up the alley. The city beyond is awash in sunlight, a crush of bikes and taxicabs and people. Beyond it all the water and the distant mountains. It can be beautiful, he thinks, when it\u2019s too bright to see the flaws.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. Move.\u201d\nThey cross over a storm canal between buildings, pockmarked with weeds and piles of trash. The only time the canals ever flow now is during the winter months, when the typhoons roll in down out of Alaska. The boy has heard it said that there never used to be typhoons in Seattle, only a soft, steady rain. He wonders what that must have been like. They\u2019re nearly across the walkway when he spies something down below. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201clook.\u201d\nThe girl pauses and glances down. There is a stairway down into the channel, where a human shape lies facedown on the concrete. A man, badly bruised, wearing an expensive suit. Neither the man nor the suit is clean. One of his eyes is swollen shut.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s dead,\u201d says the boy.\n\u201cNo, look.\u201d The man groans and picks up his head. He looks up at the sky, squints, then slumps his head back down again. There is an empty bottle nearby\u2014he reaches for it, fumbles and loses it. It rolls clattering away down the channel, and the man watches it go. He looks confused, as if he does not know how he got there.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think homeless people had nice clothes.\u201d\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t homeless,\u201d says the girl. \u201cHe\u2019s just on his way down.\u201d\n\u201cWe should get help. Someone might be worried.\u201d\n\u201cThe way they worry about us?\u201d she asks. \u201cNo one worries about us.\u201d\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t true,\u201d he says. He thinks then about his grandmother, is distracted by a shadow overhead. They\u2019ve attracted a guest it seems, a drone, a remote-controlled quadcopter. No markings on it anywhere\u2014could be police, could be the news, could be some hobbyist holed up somewhere with the curtains drawn. It hovers above them like an insect, fixes them all with its cold camera eyes. There is a faint green backshine to its optics.\nThe girl says, \u201cI\u2019ll be quick. Just hold on.\u201d She hops down into the canal and begins frisking the drunken man; meanwhile the boy looks back at the drone, watches it lose interest and fly away. He wonders: what unseen force lurked behind those lenses? What did it see? Did it feel anything? Why did it turn away? He supposes that it makes no difference. A god that sees but does not care is the same as no god at all. The girl climbs back up, fixes her coat and her bag.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone must have already rolled him. We should go.\u201d\n* * *\nShe buys them each a hot dog and they take seats on the edge of a terrace wall, just up the street from the Union Gospel Mission. The line for a bed and a hot meal stretches around the block. Here, the folk of the lower boroughs mix with the college kids and tech bourgeoisie of downtown. This is where the rest of the city buys their drugs, their girls, their boys. In the distance, the rusted cranes shimmer above the flooded ruins of the Old Harbor. The girl\u2019s attention is elsewhere. She says to no one particularly, \u201cI\u2019d want to live there, if I could.\u201d\nThe boy follows her gaze. Across the street, on the side of an old building, is painted the ghost of a mural. It says SEATTLE! in friendly vintage letters, and the years have left it bleached and faded by the sun. The city the mural shows is a quarter of its current size, and its skyscrapers are fewer, its hills still blanketed with pine. Beyond the Space Needle and the downtown skyline, Mt. Rainier is still covered in snow, and in the right foreground a cartoon orca breaches the water\u2014its bright smile strikes the boy as sad, out of place. Like a mascot with no one left to cheer.\nThe girl says, \u201cMy mom always liked orcas. She gave me a stuffed one when I was little. You know, before.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d It occurs to him that no one speaks of the Mount Rainier incident directly now. It seems unnecessary\u2014all it takes anymore is a pause, a change in someone\u2019s voice, a word like before, and everyone knows what is meant. He thinks back to the day when a wall of mud and volcanic ash swept away his parents\u2019 car, on the freeway just outside of Issaquah. It is the same with the deaths of the last orcas. He has learned that there are some things we simply do not speak of, and the girl\u2019s admission now frightens him.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to invite me along,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one else does. Why didn\u2019t you just leave me back at the school?\u201d\nShe shakes her head, as if she hasn\u2019t heard him. She goes on, saying, \u201cShe named it Oscar for me. After she died, I slept with it every night, even though I was too old and only babies do that. Then when we moved, we had to pack all of our stuff up into boxes. When we unpacked I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. I asked my dad\u2014he didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about.\u201d Her gaze hardens again, and for a moment he thinks she might cry. Instead, she looks down at her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cJust forget it.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He pauses a moment, hoping that more words will rise in him, but they do not. He has a faint sense that all this pain is somehow our birthright\u2014the inevitable delivery into suffering\u2014but he does not know how to say this. Nothing beautiful ever endures. He feels a great wave of sadness then, not for himself, but for the girl. For the whole world.\n\u201cI\u2019m scared of growing up,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat if it never gets any better?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe things will be different.\u201d He watches as up the street come a pair of drifters, a young man and young woman. They wear their long hair braided, have covered their bodies in ornate tattoos. They wear old camouflage pants and tank tops, carry heavy rucksacks and walk a pair of dogs ahead of them on leashes. Even the dogs are loaded out\u2014like their owners they have a rangy look, lean and well muscled. He thinks that together they look like the old tribespeople from the history texts at school. He wonders if one day everything will be like this. The pair soon slips back into the crowds, and the boy watches them go. He says, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be different.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d she says.\n* * *\nThe day begins to fade toward evening, and they head home, in the direction of the boy\u2019s apartment. They walk in silence, and when at last his building looms above them he pauses, asks, \u201cDid you want to come up? I was just gonna make us some dinner. You can join us if you want.\u201d\nThe girl frowns. \u201cSure, I guess.\u201d He types in his security code and they slip past the heavy steel door, into the cool cinderblock stillness of the stairwell. They head up, and when they reach the eighth floor they find his apartment door open. The boy\u2019s heart freezes. He calls out, \u201cGrama?\u201d\nNo response. They peer inside, discover the apartment empty. Back up the hall, the door to the fire escape is also open. He calls again, wanders out onto the rusted grating. He looks down into the alleyway below, then looks up. There is a woman several levels above them, in sandals and a long denim dress. He calls out \u201cGrama?\u201d and begins scaling the steps, with the girl just behind him. The wind makes the catwalk shake, makes him dizzy.\nHe finds her on the top level of the fire escape. She looks anxious, stares out at the city as if confused. She doesn\u2019t look like the suicide jumpers he\u2019s always heard about, but it worries him all the same. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just out with my friend. I didn\u2019t mean to be late.\u201d\nThe old woman glances back at them. Behind her, the sunset lights the water and the mountains on fire. She asks him, \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been since it rained here?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks back toward the girl. \u201cGrama, we should go in now. It\u2019s not safe here. You could fall.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got here,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to go home now. I want to go home.\u201d\n\u201cWe are home.\u201d The boy has never believed any statement less in his life. \u201cGrama, please, come down now. Come inside.\u201d\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it rain?\u201d she asks. Her voice reaches a frantic pitch. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it rain anymore?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re old now,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause that time is gone. Now please.\u201d This last remark seems to have some effect. His grandmother\u2019s eyes clear, and her mouth works open and closed. She looks down at the backs of her hands.\n\u201cIt happened again,\u201d she says. \u201cDidn\u2019t it? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n* * *\nLater the three of them sit around the kitchen table. A nature-special plays, volume off, on the projection in front of his grandmother. He knows this gives her comfort. He boils ramen on their tiny stove, portions out bowls so there is enough for everyone. He sits down once everyone has been served, watches his grandmother struggle with the chopsticks. Her motor skills are failing now as well. He says, \u201cHere, I can get you a fork.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She tries again, wrestles up a mouthful of noodles. He watches her a moment, the way he imagines one must watch over a child. His grandmother looks up from her meal, asks the girl, \u201cAre you two looking out for each other?\u201d\nThe girl glances at the boy. Frowns. \u201cYeah, I guess you could say that.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a good heart,\u201d says his grandmother. \u201cA gentle heart. Keep him safe.\u201d A shadow darkens her gaze, and she looks to the boy, asks him, \u201cIt\u2019s time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNot yet.\u201d The lie is surprisingly easy to believe. He finishes his own portion, pushes back from the table, takes his bowl, and kisses her cheek on the way by. \u201cYou need to eat more, Grama. You\u2019ll be hungry later.\u201d\n* * *\nAfter all the dishes are put away, the girl goes to leave. He sees her out, but at the head of the stairs she stops, turns. \u201cFind me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever you need me.\u201d She lingers then, as if waiting to say more. Then she turns and heads off down the stairs.\nThat night, he lies in bed with the lights off. The skyline peers through the blinds; the air feels thick with static. He thinks about his grandmother and his friend, worries about them each in equal measure. He thinks about whom he will tell tomorrow, when he goes off to school. His teacher, he expects. He imagines he will be taken from there to see the counselor, and that they will ask about his grandmother, about her illness. From there inevitably the social workers will come. He has seen this all before. He wonders what will become of him, clutches the blankets hard to his chest. He takes comfort in their warmth, the way they take on the heat from his body. They are the most comfort he has known in some time, and even now he realizes that such things fade. He is seized then by a weight in his chest, a sense of fear and pity and a longing for tears that will not come. Then a train snaps by outside, shaking the walls and shuttering them all with light. He takes a deep breath after it has gone, thinks then that there is a lesson in the trains. About the things we love. About all the memories that desert us.\nSeth Marlin holds an MFA in fiction from the Inland Northwest Center for Writers.

But she can feel his fingers trace the crude veins of her wrist, the pressure as he squeezes her last drop free. The ocean of fire blooms yellow and gold, sparks like so many embers against the membranes of her eyes.\nA doctor, he said, a healer of men, not rivers. Yet he promised to purge the sickness, the filth clogging her arteries, the fevered indentations of her brow and the black boils spilling across the puckered flesh of her back. But all that remains within her now is the muck and tangle of debris, the poisons and bloated corpses rotting in stillness.\n\u201cThere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is done.\u201d\nThe pressure dies. She mewls, hungry for herself, for cleansing. So dry, her throat tears itself to speak. He lifts her and her skin crackles and breaks at his touch and the ocean of fire flares and burns across her flesh and all she can do is gasp and crack her throat.\nShe drowns in flames.\n* * *\nShe wakes to a sky so blue she can almost taste the sea in it. A sun so white she cries out and squeezes her eyes shut just to be sure the ocean of fire has not returned. The doctor has left her in the riverbed, mud oozing around her. Her skin is cracked and sunbaked. She presses against it, presses to be the river once more, to careen from bank to bank, from mother to sea. But she is dry, so dry. She cannot break the flesh she has created. Cannot fill the long emptiness of her bones.\nBut what lies between the banks belongs to her. She slurps the mud through the cracks of her skin, through her lips. Draws the water free and into her veins until a wide circle of dried crust surrounds her. The fish and the eels and the frogs, dead now because she has been separated too long, all these corpses belong to her as well. She cannot change their death, but she can fill her emptiness with it. She hobbles toward the nearest, sets it to her mouth, and sucks the moisture free. Only dust sifts between her fingers when she is done.\nAnd still she is so dry.\nShe struggles upstream, gaining better use of her human legs with every step, pulling water from the mud beneath her feet, from the death between her toes. She leaves a trail of dust behind her, dry and sifting in the wind. Upstream, past where the flatlands break into ridged plateaus, where the plateaus blunt their fists against the stubs of mountains worn smooth with age, she used to twine her fingers through the pools of her mother and find comfort when the season turned sluggish with silt. She seeks that comfort now, that wet embrace.\nShe passes over the tracks of crocodiles and water snakes and other creatures that have broken free of her banks. If they were here, alive, she\u2019d suck them dry as well. The living hold sweeter water than the dead.\nBut as much moisture as she draws into herself, the sun claims an equal share. Nothing but the corruption remains behind. The boils blackening her dried-mud skin stretch their greedy tendrils to her thighs.\nShe is so distracted by her thirst and the constant act of consumption, she does not notice the man until she is upon him.\nAll men look alike to her. Dark, sour creatures with their water loosely bound to their flesh. There is no stillness to them. No strength. This man might be the doctor, so alike are they all, but she cannot smell the metal-sharp tang of her purified self on him. But he is in the riverbed and thus belongs to her. And she needs his moisture.\nShe falls upon his kneeling figure, draws his moaning lips to hers before she notices the slightest dimpling of his flesh where the black boils will soon rise. He is poison. She has drunk enough of his kind to know now.\nHis lips gape, fish-like. His eyes are curtained in white, seeking hers out in the oceans that drown them. \u201cLaksham? Is that you?\u201d\nShe can feel his water trembling against her flesh. Unclean, but more abundant than the rotted corpses that have been her diet so far. And the sun beats down so hot against her back. But she can still remember the ocean of white fire gushing across her own eyes, stripping away her sight when the doctor helped her from her banks. The hollow echo in her breast when she realized she could no longer hear her mother\u2019s heartbeat.\n\u201cI am not Laksham,\u201d she says. Speaking hurts. She did not make this body to speak. She lets him go and rises. He is not what she is looking for, and she cannot bring herself to draw the rivers from him.\nBut he grabs her ankle. \u201cPlease. Can you take me to the river? It is so hot.\u201d\nShe has barely made any progress herself this day, and her mother is still so far, farther than she can dream. But she can feel the pulse of the currents in his flesh, see them dancing across his skin, rainbows of motion. All else around her is sun-rot and slime.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says, and is surprised with the saying of it.\nHe releases her ankle, holds out his hand as though waiting for something. But when it is apparent she has nothing to give him, he reaches for her leg again, pulls himself up, stopping hunched into himself only when his fingers graze the cracked hollows of her thigh and waist.\n\u201cYou are not clothed,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She saw no reason for clothing when the doctor came. He only asked for human form so that his work might be easier, for veins and arteries to guide the condensed water from her mud-born flesh.\nThe man fumbles his shirt overhead. Small boils lace his spine. His currents dance less steadily between them, their rhythm disrupted. He holds out the shirt and she stares. Clothing is a thing of men, not rivers.\nBut he shakes it against her. \u201cHere.\u201d\nThe water of his flesh saturates the cloth, still thick with corruption. She drops it behind her. The man\u2019s brow furrows at the sound, but he says nothing. He grasps her arm, and they walk.\nThe man is slow. He clutches her arm too tightly, breaks furrows through her skin. His breath stinks of death. And still the sun burns and boils. And her skin bakes and cracks. She winds their path between the rotting fish, sucks them dry between her toes. If the man notices he walks only in dust, he does not ask. Merely stumbles where she leads. Murmurs in the dryness of his breath.\nAt nightfall, they collapse onto a pile of dying reeds. She did not expect her flesh to tire so quickly.\nAs the man curls into place, he whimpers, \u201cShe said she\u2019d take me to the river. She promised.\u201d\nShe, too, was promised things. Cannot understand why they have not come to pass. The tongues of men are water, and water cannot lie. He drifts into quiet, and she examines the toll of the sun upon his back. Darker than it should be, even for a man. Bubbling skin between the boils that stretch farther down his spine. An ache swells in the hollow of her breast. Her creatures were not made to walk dry beneath the sun. So she traces the curve of his spine, wills the cool shadows of the nighttime river to flow through her fingertips.\nHe groans beneath her touch. Awake. \u201cLaksham?\u201d\nShe pulls her hand away, though she has no reason to feel guilt. He is hers, and she may touch him or not touch him as she pleases. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201cI am not Laksham.\u201d\nShe wonders if all men are like this, asking questions whose answers they already know. As if the asking will change what is. She is not in the habit of speaking to men, though. So she rests her aching cage of flesh and watches the currents dance in his own.\nAnd as all men must, he sleeps.\n* * *\nThe dead bake into the mud, crust beneath the sun\u2019s glare. Even the mud is drying, becoming brittle on its surface. The waters are buried deep, take more effort to reach, provide less sustenance. Beside her, the man shrinks into himself as well. The dry heat has spread across his shoulders. The boils have risen along his neck. And between them all, his currents sigh and cease to dance.\nShe is so thirsty. She must remind herself he is poison, though she will drink him if she must. Poison is better than death. She has never felt this creeping ache in her throat before. Never had the flesh to feel it. The man must ache as well, though she can feel enough water swimming in his flesh to ease it somewhat. All in the wrong places, though.\nProgress is slower this day, and the sun blazes hotter. Corpses of men have begun to pile in the riverbed. Their flesh is indistinguishable from the mud, their eyes empty sockets that watch her from every angle. She avoids their touch but cannot avoid their questioning gazes. What water is here reeks of poison and filth. She will not drink it. By the time the sun has risen to its full height, a new smell, cold metal on her tongue, traces the wind. She forgets the corpses and presses the man faster.\nAhead, a child picks up a fish, places it in a basket. But when the child looks up, it screams and flees upriver. The man on her arm jerks, but says nothing.\nThey round a bend, and the banks are lined with men. Dead wood, dry and broken, fills their hands. Small huts line the bank as well, their grass thatch walls rustling in the wind. She knows this place. One of many that threw their dead into her waters, mingled the poison of their flesh with her own.\nBut she cannot smell the poison on them now. Only the heady scent of herself sharp against their skin like knives.\nOne of the men steps from the bank and into the riverbed. \u201cDemon,\u201d he says, and she wonders of whom he speaks.\nSeveral more men follow behind him. But she can only focus on the first. His water sings to her with every step. So clean. So pure. Her thirst shudders through her shoulders.\nAs the man raises the dead wood in his arms, she thrusts her man aside and rushes to meet the new man. He tries to scream, but she covers his mouth with her own, sucks the wet words from his lungs. Water slices through her veins. It is so little, though, and only serves to increase her thirst. She tosses down the crumbling husk of the man and strides to the nearby bank. The other men clamber atop each other, scramble backward. How their flesh still sings. But as her foot crosses the bank and touches the land that is not hers, the ocean of white fire flares across her eyes in a tidal wave. She screams and flails and drops back into the riverbed, scratches at her eyes and pushes back the flames.\nBehind her, her man cries. \u201cLaksham, Laksham, what is happening?\u201d\nThe men atop the bank pull back no farther, but neither do they brave her touch again. She could drink them all and still have but a fraction of herself returned. But it is her fraction, and she wants it back so much her own weak currents froth and spin. They belong to her, these men, all of them, so much does her essence fill them. But she cannot face the ocean of fire. Cannot bear to drown in burning whiteness again.\nShe rarely spoke to men before the doctor came. Now it has become a necessity. \u201cReturn to me.\u201d And she calls to their currents, the lines of moisture that belong to her.\nThe men step forward, surprised that their feet are moving. But she cannot sustain her fight. There is not enough of her to speak across the bank that separates them. The men stumble to a stop. One picks up a stone and flings it at her.\nShe does not think to duck, of course. Stones have skipped across her flesh for as long as she can remember, then settled beneath her, still again. But they have never caused pain. This stone strikes her thigh. Showers the dust with her brittle skin. She cries out, lets her pain fill the air. Another man picks up a stone, and another.\nBefore they can throw, her man finds her, steps between the bank and her, wraps her in his arms. She begins to suck him dry in the moment of a breath, but the tang of poison reminds her of what he carries. Her thirst draws back.\nThe men on the bank seem uncertain now. \u201cBack away, grandfather. The demon is poisoning you.\u201d\nBut the man shielding her calls back, \u201cNo, she is my Laksham. She is taking me to the river.\u201d\nTheir gazes shift in swirling eddies.\nHer man whispers against her flesh, \u201cTake me,\u201d and pushes her from the other men\u2019s voices.\nHe shields her as they slowly shuffle away, and the other men do not stop them. His flesh is near to one with her own, and so easily she could drink him dry. But she does not.\nWhen the village is behind them, she pulls away. \u201cI am not Laksham.\u201d\nThe man, her man, does not reply, but merely stares blankly with his white ocean eyes. Then he crumples to his knees. \u201cI am so hot,\u201d he whispers with his throat of stones. \u201cSo dry.\u201d\nBut he is full of water. She can see it. Dancing just beneath his skin, though weaker every day. But the dryness of his throat scratches the air around her. She has so little water in herself. She owes this man nothing. She is the river.\nBut still she holds him steady and places her lips against his, sends trickles of herself sliding down his throat. He groans until the first drops touch, then shudders in her arms. When she is done, he is panting for breath in the dust, but his flesh has regained a certain coolness, a certain moistness. His breath steadies and he reaches out his hand, finds her leg, and climbs his way upward.\n\u201cCome,\u201d she says.\nAnd the man stumbles with her.\n* * *\nAt night, they curl again on a bed of dry reeds. She watches the heat rise along his flesh. The boils have strengthened their hold, sent thick tendrils twisting into his veins. They drink deeply. She can feel them in her own flesh as well, sucking the river dry. She presses her crumbling mud flesh against him, wills the river coolness to wash over him and draw away the sun and flame and dryness. He is so frail. Her own back aches with the heat of effort.\nShe did not mean to awaken him, but she did.\n\u201cLaksham?\u201d he asks. His eternal query.\nShe is not who he is looking for. Not who he wants her to be. But she is so lonely. She does not answer him, but nor does she pull away.\nThe man rolls over, shields her with his flesh again. Finds her lips and shares what moisture he has. But he does not know how to give, so she pulls the moisture from him and sends it back. Mixes the rivers between them. The poisons in their flesh writhe and become unseated, fling back and forth between their lips. He fumbles with his trousers. Runs his fingers along the cracks of her thighs as though they were smooth currents.\nShe has felt the grasping of men and women in her arms before. She knows what is expected. So she draws him into herself, circles the river between them into a string of rapids, rushing wilder and faster until both are left panting in the reeds, mouths gaping like landed fish.\nShe had thought the man did not know how to give. She was wrong.\n* * *\nBy day she leads the man upriver, passes villages with stones already in hand and flesh smelling as strong and pure as she ever dreamed herself. By night she shares her water with the man, and he shares in return. But each day, there is less to be shared.\n\u201cLaksham,\u201d the man mumbles between feeble steps. It is the only word he has spoken for days. His boils fester now. Without her, he\u2019d be dead and rotting in the sun. With her, his skin has taken the texture of mud. His lips smell only of her.\nShe can feel the boils still digging deep into her own flesh as well, concentrating the poison in bubbles of corruption. Sending tendrils out to suck her moisture away, to push through the surface of her skin like weeds. Her mother is far. So much farther than she imagined. She cannot yet see the plateaus from here. Nor the mountain stubs. Distance meant so little when she was the river entire. Now she is only two weary feet cracking in the dust and a walk that never ends.\nThere are no more fish. No more stagnating puddles hidden beneath the riverbed crust. What the sun steals, it keeps. Yet still she shares her water with the man. Clings to the comfort of his voice. It is all she has.\nAt the next village, she stops. The smell is different. Languid and thick, bloated and full of rot. The riverbed is edged with bodies lolling in the heat, putrescence oozing from their skin. There is no pure water here. Only death.\nThe man tugs at her arm. \u201cLaksham?\u201d\nShe sits. Pulls the man down with her. \u201cCan you smell it?\u201d\nThe man says nothing.\nAs the day bends, the villagers ignore them, consumed by their own dying. By the time evening cools the air, though, she can smell something new on the wind. Pure metal. The doctor is coming.\nThe sun is near setting when the cart creaks into the village. Copper urns weigh down the open back, and through them, she can feel the river crying out to her. Driving the lone ox is the doctor.\nHe made her a promise. Now it is time for it to be fulfilled.\nThe villagers swarm the doctor. He fills their cups from the urns. When they drink, the corruption of their flesh bursts and falls away. A miracle, they cry, and bring what riches they have to be piled between the urns. But it is no miracle. She can see now what the doctor has done. The rivers in the urns have been condensed tighter even than what she gave him. The black boils drink, bloat their greedy tendrils, but the water is too strong. Despite this truth, the doctor accepts the cries of miracle and resulting riches with a smile.\nUntil he drives his ox to the riverbank where those too weak to move have piled themselves. His smile falters then, when he sees her sitting nearby. Still he fills cups, though his eyes never leave her. And all she can feel is her blood singing out to the urns, crying for reunion so loudly the weight of it crushes her. What little of her the doctor has given out to the men is nothing compared to what of her remains in those urns. And that condensed self might be enough to cure the vast sickness dug into her own flesh.\nShe reaches out a hand. \u201cYou promised,\u201d she says, never imagining her voice could be so small.\nThe doctor licks his lips, fills the last cup put in his hand. And when the cup is filled, he breaks his gaze away, secures the urns, and climbs up to drive his cart once more. He says nothing, but his silence tells her the truth better than his tongue ever did. The doctor is not a doctor of rivers. He cares only for men.\nShe will not reach her mother. She knows this now. It is too hot, the journey too far. She will die cradled in her riverbed bones. And the doctor will let her and will not care.\nThe men of the village notice her now their own pain is gone. Stones fill their hands. Despair fills the river\u2019s heart.\nThe first one strikes, and she grunts at the impact. She waits for her man to shield her. They will not strike him. They never do. But he is unmoving. And she cannot understand it until she pushes away the song drowning her ears and hears the slow death of the currents in his flesh. One by one, they falter and fail, too little water to flow. He belongs to her, all the water of him and all the flesh. If he dies, she will have nothing.\nShe will not let him die.\n\u201cCure him,\u201d she says to the doctor, and stumbles behind her man, lifts him aright. His body sways like the wind, he is so light in her fingers.\nThe stones pause.\nThe doctor\u2019s hand falters on his prod. His grip whitens. But then he shakes his head and stings his ox into movement. As the cart pulls away, the stones begin to fly again, striking both her and the man, and she cannot understand except perhaps her man no longer looks quite like them anymore. Too much water has been shared between them. He whimpers as the stones hit, but does not move. Does not ask her to take him away. So she turns her body about, shields him from the stones, and sucks in a breath with every strike against the dust of her flesh. And still her man is dying.\nIf the doctor will not cure him, then she will. Her waters are not thick enough to burst the corruption on their own, but she is the river and knows the ways of water better than even the doctor. She will force the boils to drink, now she knows their secret.\nEven as the stones break on her, she puts her lips against her man\u2019s and draws forth what river remains in her and pushes it through his lips. A torrent gushes into his frame. He would cry out if she gave him breath, but everything is thrust into him. Nothing released. The boils suck greedily, bulge, then try to stop, but she pushes against them, pours into them, feeding all the corruption in her man\u2019s veins until it cannot hold. And the ocean of fire shoots meteors into her eyes, sears her emptying body to ash. She is drowning, struggling to stay atop the waves of flame long enough to save him.\nWhen she can give no more, she stops. The ashes of her are torn with every touch of the wind. She would scream if she had breath.\nHer man pants and clings to her brittle shoulders even as they crumble. His sickness is gone. But she has poisoned him anew. She could not separate the corruption of herself, the muck and tangle and rot of ages, from the river that held it. She is not the doctor.\nShe wants to tell him this\u2014she needs to tell him this\u2014but the ocean of fire is consuming her. Everything is yellow and gold and exploding, and she is only aware of the man by the singing of his currents and by her need to drain him dry.\n\u201cThe river,\u201d he gasps. \u201cLaksham, the river.\u201d\nAnd she almost drinks him then to quench the flames. Almost. But instead she thrusts him away and in the thrusting loses her arms to the wind. She can hear his currents searching for her, singing out, but stronger are the waves of fire rolling over her head, and somewhere in them she can hear singing also.\nShe does not drown in the flames. She embraces them. And the wind scatters her across the riverbed, and the last thing she hears is the hungry mewl of her man\u2019s voice: \u201cLaksham!

Okay. She\u2019s out on deep-space exploration. But she always says. . . .\u201d She trailed off before she could finish the sentence about Tara-didi\u2019s breathless missives all about Sasha this and Sasha that. Sasha was from Russia and had beautiful cheekbones and was also Tara\u2019s ship\u2019s chief engineer, not that that fact had come up all that often in Tara\u2019s letters. \u201cRight now it\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you,\u201d Auntie said. \u201cNo, no, beta, it is Chandni I am meaning. She is a sweet girl. Not at all modern! She will drape your sari at her marriage even, ha.\u201d\n\u201cChandni?\u201d Archana said, confused, and then the floor lurched under her feet, so Auntie squeaked and Archana hung on to the faucets for dear life; when the world righted again she pulled off the petticoat and blouse with no further ceremony and fished a shift dress out of her bag. \u201cCome on, Auntie,\u201d she said, \u201cthey all saw me in my finery, now all they care about is the food\u201d\u2014and then ran for it before there could be any argument.\nOut in the space of the corridor it was quiet, except for the soft echoes of the welcome-to-the-wedding party drifting along the ventilation shafts. Definitely the sound of a lot of munching going on. \u201cYou,\u201d Archana said, \u201care such a cow.\u201d\n\u201cAww, didi!\u201d Chandni appeared at her left shoulder, as she always did. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean.\u201d\n\u201cAnd tipping Manju Auntie into the urinal wasn\u2019t mean?\u201d\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a urinal,\u201d Chandni said, sulkily. \u201cI had them all ripped out, they make me smell. And I wouldn\u2019t have let you fall.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Archana said, not quite convinced. \u201cAnd why\u2019d you do it, anyway? Can you even get married? Like\u201d\u2014she warmed to the topic\u2014\u201cwith a giant baraat and everything?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d have to be light-years across.\u201d Chandni frowned and bounced her hair over her shoulders. Such beautiful hair, Archana thought. Chandni looked young for her age and always would. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same for us. Though I\u2019m sure I\u2019d look nice in red.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, you\u201d\u2014Archana pointed to Chandni\u2019s pretty pink anarkali and the roses in her hair\u2014\u201cor you?\u201d\nThat time she pointed to the wall, to indicate the exploratory mining vessel Chandragrahan. Both Archana\u2019s baby sister, though. She suspected Auntie had just forgotten.\n\u201cBoth, I think,\u201d Chandni said thoughtfully. \u201cLater on can I try on your lehenga? The one for the reception day?\u201d\n\u201cDo you really want to do that?\u201d Archana asked, surprised. \u201cI thought you were\u2014you know. You\u2019re a ship, kiddo.\u201d\nChandni glared at her. On her baby face, it looked more adorable than anything. \u201cYes,\u201d she muttered, \u201cbut I\u2019m not at all modern.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, of course you can,\u201d Archana said, amused, and they went back down to the party.\n* * *\nLupita was not on board. First, it was Archana\u2019s father who had been doubtful\u2014\u201cBeta, it does not seem right\u201d\u2014and then Supriya Auntie had made noises like chee, chee, and after that Chandni had refused to open the docking bay doors.\n\u201cNot till afterwards,\u201d she\u2019d said when Archana complained, and later, in the privacy of the room they were sharing for the wedding festivities, she added: \u201cDad doesn\u2019t like it! And I can\u2019t. You know.\u201d\nArchana took a deep breath. \u201cChandni, we\u2019ve been living together three years.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Chandni said, conciliatory, but the docking bay doors stayed firmly shut and Archana gave in.\n\u201cJust a week,\u201d she said brightly to the screen, \u201cand it\u2019s been two days already, it\u2019ll be fine! Christ, you look so hot and I miss you so much, let\u2019s run away to Oort Station and elope.\u201d\nLupita twirled in her dress for Archana\u2019s benefit. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d she asked, laughing. Her voice was crystal-clear, as though she were right there in the room, or as though someone somewhere were paying special attention to the quality of the connection. \u201cAnd tomorrow\u2019s the blessing ceremony, right? We\u2019ll see each other then.\u201d\n\u201cFor, like, five minutes,\u201d Archana said, \u201cand there\u2019ll be some guy chanting Sanskrit at us.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s on offer I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Lupita said. \u201cHey, is that your room? What\u2019s with the\u201d \u2014she squinted and came closer so for a second the screen was entirely her nose\u2014\u201cflorals?\u201d\nArchana looked at the pastel extravaganza walls with a sigh. \u201cChandni,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery room I\u2019ve ever shared with her has ended up looking like this after a while. Before you ask\u201d\u2014she held up a hand\u2014\u201cyes, it\u2019s a ship, yes, there\u2019s a tonne of space for all of us. But Mum thought it was important we shared a room growing up, for socialisation.\u201d\n\u201cChandni\u2019s or yours?\u201d Lupita stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding. How are you holding up?\u201d\n\u201cUrgh,\u201d Archana said, morose. \u201cAll the aunties spent hours draping me. And undraping me. And pretending not to understand me when I spoke English. And complaining about my complexion.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a lovely complexion.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, what the hell even is a complexion.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m sure you have a lovely one.\u201d Lupita grinned at her. \u201cSee you tomorrow, honey.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Archana said, and the screen went black. After a minute Chandni sidled in, still immaculate in the same pink anarkali.\n\u201cI\u2019d have given you longer,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Naya is a bugger, na.\u201d Naya was the orbital station where Lupita was staying. \u201cDon\u2019t you know there\u2019s important traffic on the channel, blah blah. This was important.\u201d\nChandni really did believe that these good-night chats with Lupita were important, Archana thought, trying to take comfort in it, but that night the bed seemed empty and cold. Chandni was curled up at the bottom of it and taking up three extra pillows, and that was nice enough, but she gave off no heat.\n* * *\nThere was a package from Tara-didi in the morning, delivered via orbital station pickup with a note stuck to the outside. Should be opaque to little sister\u2019s sensors, she\u2019d written. Us bad girls need to stick together. Archana only had time for a quick peek at something pointy-pink with four speed settings before Dabbu Auntie barged in to call her to the beautician. \u201cShe has come from Naya Bharat!\u201d Dabbu Auntie announced. \u201cTo thread your eyebrows! You want to get married with those so-shaggy caterpillars? Come!\u201d\n\u201cAuntie,\u201d Archana said, \u201cLupita already knows what my eyebrows look like. And Chandni can probably do them better, and less painfully, with a narrow-beam laser\u201d\u2014but Dabbu Auntie clapped her hands and strode forth, and once in the beautician\u2019s chair Archana was poked and prodded and seared (with portable, not ship-mounted, lasers) while her mother wrung her hands and tried to be diplomatic and encouraging.\n\u201cArchana always had such different interests, na?\u201d she said to Dabbu Auntie, who only sniffed, and the beautician made a noise like aaaaaie! at Archana\u2019s bitten-down fingernails.\n\u201cThat means butch,\u201d Archana said helpfully, but no one was listening to her, and later, she kept her voice soft when she asked: \u201cMum, would you have liked it better if I\u2019d been into this\u201d\u2014a gesture at the rows of nail polishes on offer, prismatic, sugar shimmer, and classic red\u2014\u201cstuff? When I was growing up, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cMarried woman now! Should take more care,\u201d Dabbu Auntie said, and Mum just looked apologetic, so that seemed to be that.\n* * *\nChandni had gone all out for the mehndi party, decorating her observation deck with streamers that trailed sparkles and changed colour with reference to the elliptic plane. The girls from grad school had brought bottles of bubbly and put on music, and no one had told any of them that they wouldn\u2019t be able to touch anything while they waited for their mehndi to dry, but the girls who were still waiting held glasses to the lips of the ones who\u2019d had it done, and Archana had to admit it was pretty fun.\n\u201cThanks for inviting us all,\u201d said Lily excitedly; she\u2019d been in Archana\u2019s first-year class on Structural Engineering for Interstellar Mining Operations, and they\u2019d made friends originally because she reminded Archana of Chandni. \u201cI mean, this is just super, isn\u2019t it? And I\u2019ve read up loads on Indian weddings, I don\u2019t want to put my foot in it by mistake. Is it true that the night before the wedding the bride\u2019s girlfriends steal the groom\u2019s shoes? I guess\u201d\u2014she grinned\u2014\u201cthe other bride\u2019s shoes.\u201d\nBefore Archana could reply, an arm was put around her shoulders. \u201cArr\u00e9, bacchha,\u201d said Supriya Auntie, \u201ctime for talk-shalk later! Mehndi time. You want to look beautiful for your wedding, no?\u201d\nWhere Mum had got the mehndi-walla and his three minions out here beyond Ceres, Archana had no idea, but she went along with it quietly enough as she was put in a chair and told to extend all extremities. The mehndi-minions chattered in Hindi while they produced cones of the stuff, doing beautiful intricate patterns across her fingertips, her palms, her ankles and wrists. It was customary to hide the beloved one\u2019s name somewhere in the design: Archana wondered if they\u2019d left enough room for \u2018Lupita.\u2019\n\u201cMum,\u201d she said in English, \u201cI don\u2019t think they know I understand them. They keep talking about how giant my feet are. Also I have to pee.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Her mother looked up and laughed. \u201cJust be patient and bear it, okay, beta? I\u2019ll send them for Lupita too if she wants it. Will she want it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Archana said, honestly unsure. \u201cLet\u2019s keep them on hand and get Chandni to ask her.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d her mother said, said as much to the minions, and went off to speak to Chandni\u2019s local terminal; Archana shifted slightly in her chair and tried to convey, through gesture and movements of her eyebrows, that she could do with a break. The mehndi-minions looked at each other blankly and Archana sighed and let it go.\n\u201cLily?\u201d she called. \u201cCome offer the bride a libation, why don\u2019t you.\u201d\nLily grinned, bowing with the glass before holding it up to Archana\u2019s mouth, which made her snort with laughter into the bubbles. One of the mehndi-wallas turned to his friend and said in Hindi, She\u2019s simple, like a little girl, and Archana was patient and bore it.\n* * *\nChandni gave a dance performance the night before the marriage ceremony. \u201cFor our friends in the audience who may be unfamiliar,\u201d she explained, standing on the little stage at the front of the ship\u2019s main function room, \u201cwe call this bharatnatyam. It\u2019s a classical Indian dance form that is thought to be thousands of years old.\u201d\nWhen she began, the room became quieter, if not silent. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d Lily said, her eyes wide, \u201cthat\u2019s beautiful. How come you never did anything like that?\u201d\nArchana tensed up, then forced herself to relax. The room was full of people clearly entranced; a minute ago they\u2019d been intent on the buffet table or showing off their mehndi. Archana didn\u2019t know if Lupita had had it done, but her sisters and cousins certainly had: they were here tonight in beautiful borrowed saris and shouting in joyful Spanish at monolingual aunties. They were all getting along fine.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, at last. \u201cI guess\u2014I wasn\u2019t interested. I knew what I was like pretty early on, you know? Staying home from family parties and driving Mum mad with the state of my clothes. And Chandni\u2014well, she knows every human language now, pretty much, but she went to Saturday Hindi class to please Dad. Took dance lessons from when she was twelve. She was\u201d\u2014Archana smiled, suddenly, looking up at Chandni in mid-execution of a smooth and graceful form\u2014\u201cperfect. She is perfect, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty great too, Archana,\u201d Lily said, steadfast, and Archana grinned.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, and would have said something more, asked about Lily\u2019s kids or her thesis, but was drawn away by an arm around her shoulders.\n\u201cArr\u00e9, beta, five minutes only,\u201d said Sanjita Auntie, and Archana sighed and went along with her to the buffet table.\n\u201cHi, Auntie,\u201d she said, looking down at the vat of dal makhani with some resignation. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can\u2019t come and say congratulations?\u201d Sanjita Auntie said. \u201cYou should be very happy, beta, the family are very good.\u201d She meant Lupita\u2019s family, now applauding wildly at the close of Chandni\u2019s performance and looking thoughtfully determined as the first of the proper dance music came on. \u201cAnd when the babies come it will be different, na? We will all help.\u201d\n\u201cWith what?\u201d Archana said absently, skipping over the whole babies thing and wondering if there might be dessert soon. Indian after all, murmured a voice in her head; she told it to get stuffed.\n\u201cAh, beta, don\u2019t worry, you will learn Hindi before they come, and Chandni will teach them dancing, and your ma will\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Archana said, cutting her off, still half-thinking about fruit and ice cream and wishing very devoutly that those were the only things on her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like that, is it?\u201d\n\u201cBeta, don\u2019t get upset! I only say these things because. . . .\u201d\n\u201cBecause you love me,\u201d Archana said, louder than she\u2019d meant, \u201cbecause you bloody love me\u201d\u2014and she was going to cry any minute, she thought. Thirty years old and she was going to start crying into a bowl of dal, like at every family party since the beginning of things. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fix me for the sake of my children. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it, Sanjita Auntie?\u201d\n\u201cArchana, beta, why you say such things!\u201d Sanjita Auntie said. \u201cWe all want to help you only.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Archana said, \u201cbut no thanks. Keep your goddamn help.\u201d\n\u201cKya bath hain ye,\u201d Sanjita Auntie said, sniffing, and Archana looked over her shoulder at her mother bustling across the dance floor, deftly avoiding Lupita\u2019s whirligigging sisters; her father was coming in through the far door, with the quick eye for trouble you developed when running a six-day multiple-shindig event, and Archana thought it was still possible that she might make it through this without crying herself, but a good full-throated scream was coming up as an option\u2014and then a quiet voice said:\n\u201cStep back.\u201d\n\u201cChandni beta,\u201d Sanjita Auntie said, dabbing at her eyes with her dupatta, \u201cthis is grown-up talk, you just sit down and. . . .\u201d\n\u201cAuntie,\u201d Chandni said sweetly, \u201cI am the deep-space exploratory mining vessel Chandragrahan. I have a top cruising speed of fourteen times the speed of light in a vacuum and enough standard armament to blow up an asteroid nine hundred and fifty kilometres in diameter. Step back from my sister before I make you.\u201d\nFrom behind her, a woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cArchana? Chandni sent a shuttle across. She said you needed me urgently.\u201d\nArchana looked up and burst into tears.\n* * *\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d Lupita said, a while later. They were in one of the little anterooms off the function hall, where Chandni had provided soft lighting and Lily another bottle of bubbly. \u201cDon\u2019t cry any more, it freaks me out.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Archana said, sniffling, and then took another chug of the wine and felt better. \u201cSorry, sorry, I\u2019m ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you are,\u201d Lupita said, comfortably, \u201cbut your sister is soothing all your aunts and your mom and mine are comparing outfit notes and your friends from grad school are teaching my t\u00eda Marta how to do shots and we haven\u2019t even gotten married yet, so, you know.\u201d\nArchana laughed a little and hiccupped. \u201cWe are married,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in every way that matters. This is just to\u201d\u2014she gestured\u2014\u201ckeep my damned family happy.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d Lupita asked; Archana sighed.\n\u201cThey want to change me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want me to be a good, perfect, beautiful Indian girl. Like. . . .\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Chandni asked. She came in and sat cross-legged on the floor, pouring herself some champagne. There hadn\u2019t been a third glass a moment before, but that made no difference to her. \u201cArchana-didi, I\u2019m a ship.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah\u201d\u2014Archana gestured\u2014\u201cbut. . . .\u201d\n\u201cBut nothing. I won\u2019t get married. I won\u2019t give Mum grandchildren.\u201d She waved the drink around, a little unsteadily. \u201cWhat, you think I\u2019ll meet a planetoid with prospects? Yes, I\u2019m perfect. I\u2019m a perfect AI.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lupita said conversationally, \u201cwhat an interestingly complementary inferiority complex.\u201d\n\u201cYou shut up, you\u2019re taking my didi away.\u201d Chandni folded her arms and glowered. Lupita grinned.\n\u201cChandni,\u201d Archana said, meaning every word, \u201cyou\u2019re perfect and I love you\u201d\u2014and that time Lupita rolled her eyes.\n\u201cGood thing you brought me over,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly y\u2019all need someone smart around.\u201d\nArchana laughed a little at that, and Chandni smiled shyly, and Archana was thinking they might talk about it again, but not now, not yet. Lupita shook her head with amused resignation, then stopped short, looking at her feet. \u201cChandni,\u201d she said, after another moment, \u201cwhere the shit are my shoes?\u201d\nChandni looked expressionlessly at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve put them on a fucking asteroid, haven\u2019t you.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d Chandni was saying, as Archana stood up and walked back into the function hall, \u201cPhobos is more of a moon\u201d\u2014and Archana kept on going, across the floor, to where her mother was standing back from the riotous dancing.\n\u201cBetter, beta?\u201d her mother asked, and Archana considered, then nodded. Her mother smiled wryly at her. \u201cThey do love you, you know,\u201d she added after a moment, and Archana didn\u2019t need to ask who she meant, following her mother\u2019s gaze to Dabbu Auntie and Manju Auntie flailing wildly and trying to persuade Lupita\u2019s abuela to join in.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Archana said, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Lupita get ready together in the morning?\u201d her mother said. \u201cWe can\u2019t send the poor girl back so late and Chandni can find another room to sleep in, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She grinned. \u201cShe\u2019ll complain, but it\u2019s brides\u2019 prerogative.\u201d\nArchana grinned back: she knew what her mother, in her own way, was trying to say. She thought that she might ask Lupita to dance with her, in a little while, and then maybe Chandni, or her dad; and after that, when Lupita\u2019s sisters got back from carrying T\u00eda Marta to bed, it would be time for dessert.\nIona Sharma is a writer, lawyer, and linguaphile, and the product of more than one country.
